https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/magazine/donald-trump-rallies-campaigning-president.html,"It was in the last half-hour of Donald Trump’s speech in Moon Township, Pa., that a sense of what exactly it was that I was watching — what I and everyone else had been watching throughout Trump’s presidency to that point — finally clicked into place with startling clarity. This was in early March, in an unexpectedly pristine hangar by the Pittsburgh airport, its white floor buffed to a shine in which I could make out my reflection. The implicit purpose of the event was to bring some Trump magic to a fellow Republican’s faltering campaign. Moon Township is in Pennsylvania’s 18th District, which Trump won in 2016 by nearly 20 points and where in three days, the Republican state representative Rick Saccone would narrowly lose a special congressional election to Conor Lamb, a Democrat who had never run for office.Saccone took the stage briefly before Trump did, and his people were circulating in the hangar: normal-looking suburban Republican operatives and volunteers of the sort who are still jarring to see attached to the Trump roadshow, like insurance-claims adjusters piled into the bed of a monster truck. But this was a Trump event in spirit: the email advisory from Donald J. Trump for President Inc., his official presidential campaign committee, described it as a “campaign rally” but did not mention Saccone, explaining instead that Trump would “highlight the benefits that his historic tax cuts are providing hard-working families across Pennsylvania and to celebrate our booming economy now that America is once again open for business.” Onstage, Trump seemed to intermittently remember the tax cuts and the booming economy, and even more intermittently that he was supposed to be promoting the candidate, whom he had reportedly derided in private as “weak.” But he mostly did what he usually does at his rallies: recite the latest verse of the ballad of Donald Trump, the president who would be doing great things for the people in this room were it not for his many antagonists.This evening, he was talking about Peggy Noonan, the conservative Wall Street Journal columnist. (“She’s a Bushie!” an older man next to me yelled scornfully.) Noonan had apparently written something, or (more likely) said something on cable news, where she appears often as a pearl-necklaced avatar of political normalcy, about Trump’s appearing inadequately presidential. “I’m very presidential!” Trump told us, with mock indignation. Then he stiffened in his suit and adopted a stentorian tone, like a fourth grader doing an impression of his school principal. “Laaaadies and gentlemen,” he intoned, “thank you for being here tonight. Rick Saccone will be a great, great congressman. He will help me very much. He’s a fine man, and Yong is a wonderful wife. I just want to tell you on behalf of the United States of America that we appreciate your service. And to all of the military out there, we respect you very much. Thank you. Thank you.” He broke character for a second: “And then you go, ‘God bless you, and God bless the United States of America, thank you very much.’ ” He turned and faced the V.I.P. guests in the riser behind him, and did a sort of rigid penguin walk.The crowd whooped and laughed — not the cruel laughter you come to know at Trump rallies but real belly laughter, for what was a genuinely funny bit. Trump, who loves nothing more than being loved, kept penguin-walking, and everyone kept laughing. It took a few more seconds for the spectacular strangeness of the moment to settle in: We were watching a sitting American president imitating an American president.The president in Trump’s impression was an authority figure experienced at Olympian, inhuman remove. All of us in the hangar, Trump included, were accustomed to the presence of this person: to admiring or lampooning him, loving or hating him, but always having him there.Except now, he wasn’t. Watching Trump step into the archetype momentarily and then just as quickly step out, it hit me: Even in Trump’s mind, that president was someone else, somewhere else. It was as if I were sitting on a commercial flight, at cruising altitude, when the pilot suddenly plopped down in the next seat, commiserated about the tarmac delays and poor in-flight service, then popped an Ambien and went to sleep.There is a widely held theory that Donald Trump did not, and maybe still does not, really want to be president. Whether or not this is true, what can be ventured with greater certainty is that no candidate has ever delighted as visibly as Trump did in campaigning to be president, and that his having been elected was the period at the end of a sentence that he would happily have let run on forever. For Trump, the campaign trail was a place of self-actualization. On the stage was where he seemed most himself — so much so that, not even a full day after his election, the president-elect mused to his staff about the possibility of another series of rallies.A weekend tour, he was thinking then: an encore. The more pressing realities of the presidential transition quickly asserted themselves, but a week later, George Gigicos, the advance-team director for Trump’s campaign, told a reporter at Trump Tower that plans were indeed in motion for a “victory tour,” as he described it. “It will happen in the next couple of weeks,” Gigicos said; Trump would go “obviously to the states that we won and the swing states we flipped over.”By the time the first dates of the tour were announced, on Nov. 29, it had been tactfully rechristened a “thank-you tour”: nine rallies in nine states throughout December. “I was with the advance team yesterday, and they’re showing me all the different places he’s going in the next two weeks,” Anthony Scaramucci, at the time a member of the executive committee of Trump’s transition team, told the Fox Business Network’s Maria Bartiromo. “This is a guy who doesn’t give up.”He didn’t: After taking a few weeks in January and February to be inaugurated and acquaint himself with the business of running the country, Trump held another rally. He has been holding them regularly ever since, sometimes as often as twice a month. His itinerary has not once diverged from the states on his electoral map; he had been to the exact same hangar in Moon two days before winning Pennsylvania in 2016. There have been 20 rallies in all, give or take a couple that might be construed as more conventional presidential appearances — though it is hard for even these to not take on the character of a Trump rally when he takes the stage. They amount to one of the few sustained, continuous projects of his presidency, and represent a genuinely novel contribution to the theater of American politics: a “Basement Tapes” of the Trump years, a never-ending tour with stakes perpetually hazy and unclear.From the beginning, I thought it would be important to witness these rallies, and I went as often as I could. Whenever I did, I was confronted with the question of what it was, precisely, that I expected to witness. Was it the people who turned out to see him? I was curious, at first, who they would be — who would show up for what were, in effect, campaign rallies for a campaign that ended months ago. I interviewed them, diligently filling notebooks:But you’ve read all this before, haven’t you? The spectrum of people at these rallies was not appreciably different from the spectrum at Trump’s actual campaign rallies, which was itself fairly representative of the broader rallygoing Republican electorate in 2016 — and interviewing people at campaign events, as every reporter believes secretly but is not allowed to admit, is almost always a waste of time for everyone involved in the exchange, like asking Mets fans at a Mets game why they like the Mets.These rallies rarely produced news, and what news they produced was usually limited to something Trump said, which meant you could just as easily cover it from the comfort of your own couch, thanks to the handful of live-broadcasting TV crews that was always packed onto a riser in the back of the venue. These people served double duty as a hate totem for the events, the most reliable targets for ritual humiliation from the stage. Huddled around their tripods, buffeted by thousands of boos and obscenities, they called to mind weathercasters lashed to telephone poles, early-Dan Rather-style, in a hurricane. Their footage, chopped up and YouTubed and GIFed and John Olivered, would be injected into the infinitely subdividing capillaries of social-media outrage in near real time. Sometimes at the rallies, I would look at these camera crews and then open Twitter on my phone, watch it welling up with cascades of disbelief at whichever deliberately disbelief-inducing thing Trump had just said, and wonder what the point of any of us being there was.But there was something about these rallies that you couldn’t see from your couch. I have never interviewed Trump, but people I know who have often remark on an uncanny element of the experience: the absence of any indication of an off-limits private self distinct from his public image. The phenomenon feels radically postmodern: a complete communion of the thing with its representation, officiated by an audience of millions over the course of nearly four decades. The tens of thousands of people who came to see him speak at campaign events might have numbered well below the millions who had watched him on TV, but the sheer physical fact of them — he would talk endlessly at his rallies about the lines trying to get inside the building, the poor put-upon fire marshals who had to deliver the bad news — seemed to entrance him. During the general election, Trump once called a reporter I know excitedly from the air as he descended to an event, and told him to turn on cable news; he was looking down at the rally and marveling at the size of the crowd. “Celebrity is a mask that eats into the face,” John Updike once wrote — but with Trump, it was hard to imagine the face ever having been there at all.Only a man like this could conceive of a permanent campaign, extending infinitely after Election Day, as something desirable. From the first, the postelection rallies were bemoaned as, at best, a waste of presidential time, but this missed their peculiar intimacy. To feel as if you were witnessing something essential and true about Barack Obama, you would have had to see him alone in his study late at night. To witness the same of Trump, you have to stand among thousands gathered to see him — and see him seeing you seeing him.“You!” Trump said, pointing to a man in the crowd. “I just saw him on television — he said: ‘I love Trump! Let Trump do what he has to do!’ ”This was in Melbourne, Fla., last February — Trump’s first rally after taking office. He was in Mar-a-Lago mode, open-collared and visibly at ease, more so than he had been at any point since Inauguration Day. Five days earlier, Michael Flynn, his national security adviser, had resigned over Flynn’s contacts with Russian officials, and Trump had asked the F.B.I. director, James Comey, to stop investigating him. One of the largest single-day demonstrations in American history had been staged in protest of Trump — less as a president than as a human being — dwarfing his own inauguration’s attendance. His travel ban was gummed up in federal court. But this wasn’t Washington, or the Fourth Circuit; it was Florida, “my second home,” as Trump had described it. “Come here — let him up, I’m not worried about him,” he said as the man made his way to the stage. “Hop over the fence! He can do it — look, this guy’s in great shape. This guy is great — don’t worry about him.”The man’s name, it would later be ascertained, was Gene Huber. He was a car salesman from Boynton Beach, very tan, with a close-cropped corona of graying hair, in good shape just as the president said, wearing a commemorative T-shirt from Trump’s inauguration featuring the same presidential seal as the lectern behind which he now embraced Trump in a bear hug. “This guy! He’s been all over television, saying the best things,” Trump said. “Say a couple words.”“Mr. President, thank you, sir!” Huber said, slightly wild-eyed with adrenaline, looking not at Trump but at the cameras. “We the people, our movement, is the reason why our president of the United States is standing in front of us today. When President Trump, during the election, promised all these things he was going to do for us, I knew he was going to do this for us.”Huber yielded the microphone and exited the stage. “A star is born, a star is born,” Trump said. “I wouldn’t say that Secret Service was thrilled with that, but we know our people, right? We know our people. A great guy — and so many others, I see some others, they’re being interviewed. The media will give them no credit.” He shook his head at the treatment of this man, who had been rendered real to Trump by his appearance on television, whom the media would diligently and regularly interview henceforth, when they recognized him at the subsequent rallies that Huber religiously attended after quitting his car business post-Melbourne to dedicate himself full time to supporting the president, a cardboard cutout of whom, Huber told CNN, he kept at home and saluted every day. Like Trump himself, Huber was now famous for being famous, and in June reporters found him camped out in line the night before Trump’s rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, wearing a T-shirt printed with a photograph of himself hugging Trump on the stage in Melbourne, beneath the words WE THE PEOPLE.“It is great to be back in the incredible, beautiful, great state of Iowa!” Trump said, as he took the stage in Cedar Rapids the following evening. “Home of the greatest wrestlers in the world, including our friend Dan Gable — some of the great, great wrestlers of the world, right? We love those wrestlers.”It was five months into his presidency by then, and five rallies. In Nashville in March, Trump railed against the judge in Hawaii who issued an injunction against his revised travel ban — “This ruling makes us look weak!” — and against his own staff, which had advised him to revise it in the first place. Five days later, the same day James Comey was testifying before the House Intelligence Committee about Russian interference in the 2016 election, Trump was at another rally, this time in Louisville, Ky., talking about Colin Kaepernick: “There was an article today that reported that N.F.L. owners don’t want to pick him up because they don’t want to get a nasty tweet from Donald Trump!”The rallies had ceased to be the curiosity they were at first. Out of basic psychological necessity, if nothing else, the country was learning to metabolize the Trump presidency’s daily news barrage, of which the rallies were but one minor component, another assaultive stream of words and images entering the public consciousness in a disembodied, decontextualized way: Here was Trump, shouting somewhere. At the events, you would be reminded, with some surprise, that these moments occurred at fixed coordinates in space and time, as opposed to simply materializing in the news cycle in which the country was now trapped, 24 hours a day, by virtue of Trump’s own unwavering attention to it.By the time Trump got to Cedar Rapids, the rallies had acquired an informal template. There was an often agreeably random opening (wrestlers?), some pleasantries (in Iowa, shout-outs to Karen Handel, who had just beaten Jon Ossoff in a special congressional election in Georgia, and Steve Scalise, who had just been shot at a softball game), a brief tour through the headlines (North Korea). Then Trump would begin reciting what sounded like a conventional prepared speech, only to immediately digress from it: “Here are just some of the historic accomplishments we have achieved in just a very short period of time — and I have to just preface it by saying — thank you, darling — I have to preface it by saying, you know, I’ve been watching, they’re saying” — his voice deepening into an impression of an anchorman’s scold — “ ‘President Trump has not produced health care.’ You know,” he said, leaning in with a conspiratorial, can-you-believe-these-guys? look, “I’ve been there for five months! If you remember, during the Clinton period, they worked for years and years and years and never got health care. Obama” — here there were boos, and Trump paused briefly to enjoy them — “though after listening to that testimony, I fully understand. But President Obama, his whole administration, pushing, pushing for Obamacare, which has now failed. In fact, I was just told by your great governor, and ex-governor, that your insurance companies have all fled the state of Iowa.”The texture of this was familiar to anyone who watched Trump during the campaign. The conventional speech was there, nominally, a formal structure around which Trump improvised, embroidering it with anecdotes that may or may not have happened, turning over parts of the speech in the light and opening up the back end of it to show the audience, to let them in on the secrets, to convey a sense that he was leveling with the people who had the good sense to be there at that moment, offering a sensation of truth if not always the complete thing (Iowa’s state health-insurance exchange had lost most of its providers, but not all of them). It was fun to listen to, because Trump — and this is still perhaps the most incredible thing about his candidacy, in retrospect — was somehow the first politician in however many decades of modern American political oratory to capitalize on the fact that nobody likes listening to modern American political oratory.There was also a dissonance to these speeches, however, now that Trump had settled into his presidency. Before the election, his subversion of the forms of American politics served to underscore the basic argument of his campaign, which was that America’s problems could be solved easily if you overthrew the country’s governing class, with all their idiocies of convention. But Trump and his voters had done exactly that, and America’s problems had not instantly disappeared. One of Trump’s more reliable impulses is evading responsibility, and he spent much of these speeches herding together the scapegoats — the media, the recalcitrant Democrats, the F.B.I., the system — who might account for his situation, without appearing to realize that he was drawing the self-portrait of a man who had wanted power but gotten authority instead.On Aug. 12, white supremacists marched and then rioted in Charlottesville, Va., one of them running over a woman with his car and killing her. Asked about the episode in a news conference at Trump Tower, Trump insisted that “I think there’s blame on both sides” and described some of the white supremacists as “very fine people,” and amid the backlash that inevitably ensued, Donald J. Trump for President Inc. awakened, as it seems to do in times of trouble, to announce that on Aug. 22, there would be another rally, this one in Phoenix.The afternoon before the rally, I was settling into my seat in an American Airlines Airbus on the runway in Charlotte, N.C., when the pilot got on the intercom: “If everyone could take their seats quickly, please,” he said, a note of apologetic bewilderment in his voice, “we’re trying to beat Air Force One into Phoenix today.” Trump, he explained, was due into Phoenix around the same time we were. “If we don’t get in ahead of them, we’re going to be put in a holding pattern.”A groan went up from the passengers. “I got held up in Florida by Air Force One for four hours,” a woman sitting behind me grumbled.Across the aisle, an older man was saying something about Joe Biden and his Secret Service entourage taking up whole cars on Amtrak between Washington and Wilmington. “I’m just saying,” he protested, “both sides do this!” And so we hurtled west in our climate-controlled specimen vial of the national argument, trying desperately to outrun the man at the center of it.It was 107 degrees in Phoenix, and outside the downtown convention center paramedics with IV bags balanced on their shoulders were tending to rallygoers who had succumbed to the heat; an elderly woman in a Hawaiian shirt had toppled out of the V.I.P. line and was vomiting on the pavement. Inside, I passed a man wearing pleated khaki slacks and a sweat-drenched sleeveless undershirt with an American flag draped over his shoulders, serape-style, as if he were on his way to see Mad Max’s keynote address at CPAC. It was possible that the events in Charlottesville had depressed turnout, but it seemed just as possible that it was the heat, and the prospect of waiting outside for hours in it to file into a convention center that, when I got inside, was full, but not packed as other rallies had been.Trump recited from all of his post-Charlottesville news releases; he had them printed out. “I said, ‘Racism is evil.’ Now they only choose, you know, like a half a sentence here or there, and then they just go on this long rampage, or they put on these real lightweights all around a table that nobody ever heard of, and they all say what a bad guy I am. But I mean, do you ever see anything — and then you wonder why CNN is doing relatively poorly in the ratings. Because they’re putting like seven people all negative on Trump! And they fired Jeffrey Lord — poor Jeffrey. Jeffrey Lord.”Watching a public eruption of self-pity is an awkward experience, particularly when it is the president of the United States doing it. Even the crowd in Phoenix seemed a little unsure what to do with it, and they were the most sympathetic audience Trump could possibly have mustered. “Now, you know, I was a good student,” he went on. “I always hear about the elite. You know, the elite. They’re elite? I went to better schools than they did! I was a better student than they were! I live in a bigger, more beautiful apartment, and I live in the White House too, which is really great. I think — you know what? I think we’re the elites. They’re not the elites.”The crowd cheered for its newfound elitism, but the energy in the room was sagging palpably. It had been a long, hot day. They were still heckling the TV people in the media pen, but it felt unfocused, pro forma. “So the point is — and I didn’t want to bore you, because you understand where I’m coming from. You people understand. But the point is, that those were three different — there were two statements and one news conference. The words were perfect. They only take out anything they can think of, and for the most part, all they do is complain. But they don’t put on those words. And they don’t put on me saying those words.”The adjective I instinctively reached for, watching it, was “Nixonian,” but even Nixon generally confined this kind of thing to the White House tapes. Trump’s very public spleen-venting more closely resembled that of Andrew Johnson, Abraham Lincoln’s vice president and the reluctant and disastrous steward of Reconstruction after his death. In February 1866, after Congress tried and failed to override Johnson’s veto of a law providing federal protections for freed slaves, he gave an impromptu speech to his supporters in which he compared his Senate antagonists to Confederate generals, fulminated about supposed assassination plots against him, and in the space of barely an hour, used his own name more than 200 times. Congress impeached him two years later.“This was a Castro speech in length,” Rick Wilson, the Republican strategist, was saying on the CNN-equipped flat screens at the Phoenix airport as I waited for my flight home. “It was an astounding chain of lies tied together by a man who obviously is mentally unstable.” David Jolly, the former Republican congressman from Florida, told MSNBC’s Chris Hayes the next day: “Listen, there is no moral equivalency between this president and some of the dictators we’ve seen in the Dark Ages of the Middle East and other places around the globe. But the politics of some of those dark dictators was to always have an enemy. And that is what this president has modernized.”It is true that it is hard to get through a Trump rally now without thinking of the Philippines’ Rodrigo Duterte, Turkey’s Recep Tayyip Erdogan or the other authoritarians for whom Trump has openly expressed his admiration. And yet, watching Trump onstage in Phoenix, the instincts he was following seemed to be much more those of an entertainer than those of a demagogue. It had the feel of being in the studio audience for an unusually angry late-night host’s opening monologue. He was a guy on a stage, improvising, trying to hold the crowd, toggling between the riskier material and the easy applause lines, trying to figure out what they liked and how to give them more of it. The applause for clean coal was tepid, so he moved on to Joe Arpaio. He talked about Jonathan Gruber, the economist who helped design the Affordable Care Act, but no one seemed to know who that was, so he reached into the tangle of Fox News chyrons balled up in the back of his head and came up with something about all the people who wanted to tear down George Washington statues, and the crowd roared its indignation at this movement that did not, in any meaningful sense, exist.These moments have political consequences, but when you are watching them in person, the imperatives at play seem mostly emotional; the needs on display are raw and visible, and curiously small. But then you see the same speech on a screen, outside the reality-impeding Faraday cage of the rally venue, and you are reminded that this is the president: that he commands a nuclear arsenal and a legal system that can put people in jail or throw them out of the country and a surveillance apparatus of godlike omniscience and an unshakably loyal third, at least, of the American population. The man is trying for “The Tonight Show” and it comes out as Hugo Chavez’s “Aló Presidente.”Sometimes, watching Trump at the rallies, I would wonder idly what quotations from these events would look like etched into granite on some plaque or building like other presidents’ speeches. (YOU ARE THE MOVEMENT. I AM THE MESSENGER. I AM JUST REALLY THE MESSENGER — ALTHOUGH I’VE BEEN A VERY GOOD MESSENGER, LET’S FACE IT, RIGHT? I’VE BEEN A PRETTY GOOD MESSENGER.) We’re used to presidents delivering speeches in front of an audience, but rarely really to it. It is the speech, not the speaking of it, that is the point; its true audience is not the people in the room, but the country, or the world, or history. These speeches operate in the shadow of proper nouns: the Military-Industrial Complex Speech, the Berlin Speech, the Malaise Speech. Do you remember that Ronald Reagan delivered his Evil Empire Speech to a convention of evangelicals at the Sheraton Twin Towers Hotel in Orlando, Fla.? Of course not. He wasn’t speaking to them; he was speaking to history.Trump does not speak to history except in extremely rare cases, like his Inaugural Address or his State of the Union address, in which circumstances absolutely, nonnegotiably force him to do so. Otherwise he is always speaking to a proximate audience; unlike other presidents, the speaking, not the speech, is the point. The words would make little sense without their immediate social context. To be a member of his audience is to feel valued, part of an intimate and privileged “you” defined in relation to some broader population: Gene Huber’s “we the people” rather than the Constitution’s.You feel flattered, in spite of yourself. Trump is so at ease on the stage that you momentarily forget what a hermetic figure he is, how odd his few direct interactions with his constituents, as president, have been: his incongruous congratulations to rescue workers after Hurricane Harvey (“We love you. You are special. What a crowd. What a turnout”), his calls to wounded survivors of the Parkland school shooting in their hospital beds. (“He said he heard that I was a big fan of his, and then he said, ‘I’m a big fan of yours, too,’ ” one student, Samantha Fuentes, told The Times. “I’m pretty sure he made that up.”) Trump’s most impressive accomplishment, probably, is managing to live almost all of his adult life on stages of his own construction. But in the rare gaps between stages, the occasions that do not exist for the express purpose of his celebration, you see the consequences of having lived such a life.“Do you like me?” he asked us in the airplane hangar in Moon. He looked like he was feeling good — certainly better than in Phoenix. There was talk of his finally escaping the padded cell of convention and expertise that had half-contained his presidency. Gary Cohn, his chief economic adviser, and Hope Hicks, his communications director and human security blanket, had recently tendered their resignations. In three days he would fire — or rather, order fired — his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, and not long after that, his acting F.B.I. director, Andrew McCabe, and his national security adviser, H.R. McMaster. The White House lawyer who had been advising him on the Russia investigation, John Dowd, would quit. We — he and we, together — were forging deeper into the unknown, and it seemed to exhilarate him.The crowd did like him, and cheered. “I like you, too,” he said. “I love you! I love you! So — is there any more fun than at a Trump rally? You know, a lot of times, I have to do, like, readings — we’ll pass an environmental bill, they’ll want me to go to a — I’m very spoiled, if I go to a small place, and they have 2,000 people, it’s like, why don’t we open a stadium or something? We’re spoiled. Other guys, they go out, they get 50 people, they’re satisfied. We. Need. Crowds. Like. This. In fact, the fire marshal was fantastic. You know, they had a lot of people out — and he’s a great guy, I don’t want to get him in trouble, but he opened up those doors, and he let most of the people that were sent away, he got ’em — look at those corners! Those cameras are never going to cover those corners. They’re never going to cover the corners. They’re never going to cover — they never show the crowds. They never like to show the crowds, ever! The only thing is the noise. You can’t imitate — it sounds like a Penn State football game. It sounds like an Ohio State football game! I’ll say to friends, ‘Did you see my speech last night?’ ‘Yes.’ I have to say it: ‘How good was I? How good?’ And they say, ‘Good.’ I say, ‘Did they show the crowd?’ ‘No they didn’t. But you know what, I could tell by the noise, that crowd was really big.’ You can’t hide that. You can’t hide that.”I was there, and I can report that yes, the crowd was really big. You couldn’t hide that."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/13/us/politics/trump-tillerson-pompeo.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump on Tuesday ousted his secretary of state, Rex W. Tillerson, extending a shake-up of his administration, 14 months into his tumultuous presidency, and potentially transforming the nation’s economic and foreign policy.Mr. Trump announced he would replace Mr. Tillerson with Mike Pompeo, the C.I.A. director and former Tea Party congressman, who forged a close relationship with the president and is viewed as being more in sync with Mr. Trump’s America First credo.Mr. Tillerson learned he had been fired on Tuesday morning when a top aide showed him a tweet from Mr. Trump announcing the change, according to a senior State Department official. But he had gotten an oblique warning of what was coming the previous Friday from the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, who called to tell him to cut short a trip to Africa and advised him “you may get a tweet.”It was an abrupt end — after months of speculation — to a rocky tenure for a former oil executive who never meshed with the president who hired him. Mr. Tillerson clashed repeatedly with the White House staff and broke publicly with Mr. Trump on issues ranging from the dispute between Saudi Arabia and Qatar to the American response to Russia’s cyber aggression.“We were not really thinking the same,” Mr. Trump told reporters at the White House, explaining his decision to replace Mr. Tillerson.He added: “Really, it was a different mind-set, a different thinking.”Mr. Trump announced his decision on Twitter.At the State Department Tuesday afternoon, Mr. Tillerson said the president had called him from Air Force One just after noon — more than three hours after Mr. Trump had tweeted the news of his firing to his 49 million followers — to inform him personally of the dismissal. Mr. Tillerson said he planned to immediately step aside from his post, turning over all responsibilities by the end of the day to John J. Sullivan, the deputy secretary of state.During a short statement in a briefing room packed with reporters, Mr. Tillerson said he would end his service at midnight on March 31, but was encouraging his policy planning team and under secretaries and assistant secretaries “to remain in their posts and continue in our mission at the State Department.”“I’ll now return to private life, as a private citizen, as a proud American, proud of the opportunity I had to serve my country,” Mr. Tillerson said. He took no questions and left the briefing room.The firing of Mr. Tillerson caught even the White House staff by surprise. Just the day before, a White House spokesman berated a reporter for suggesting there was any kind of split between Mr. Tillerson and the White House because of disparate comments on Russian responsibility for a poison attack in Britain.But a senior administration official said that Mr. Trump decided to replace Mr. Tillerson now to have a new team in place before upcoming talks with Kim Jong-un, the North Korean leader he plans to meet by May. The president also wanted a new chief diplomat for various ongoing trade negotiations.The White House’s purge extended to Mr. Tillerson’s inner circle. The under secretary of state for public affairs, Steve Goldstein, was fired, and the status was unclear of Mr. Tillerson’s chief of staff, Margaret Peterlin, and his deputy chief of staff, Christine Ciccone.Mr. Tillerson was at the State Department on Tuesday and spoke to reporters, saying that he would surrender his authority at midnight and resign officially at the end of the month.At the C.I.A., Mr. Pompeo will be replaced by the current deputy director, Gina Haspel, who will be the first woman to head the spy agency. Both she and Mr. Pompeo would need confirmation by the Senate to take the positions.Mr. Tillerson has been out of favor with Mr. Trump for months but had resisted being pushed out. His distance from Mr. Trump’s inner circle was clear last week when the president accepted an invitation to meet with Mr. Kim, to Mr. Tillerson’s surprise.Mr. Trump said Mr. Pompeo “has earned the praise of members in both parties by strengthening our intelligence gathering, modernizing our defensive and offensive capabilities, and building close ties with our friends and allies in the international intelligence community.”“I have gotten to know Mike very well over the past 14 months, and I am confident he is the right person for the job at this critical juncture,” the president continued, in a written statement distributed by the White House. “He will continue our program of restoring America’s standing in the world, strengthening our alliances, confronting our adversaries, and seeking the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.”In a Twitter post, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, warned that the turnover at the top of the State Department had diminished the United States with foreign leaders.Mr. Pompeo, a former congressman, has become a favorite of Mr. Trump’s, impressing the president with his engaging approach during morning intelligence briefings. But he also, at times, has been at odds with the president — including agreeing with a C.I.A. assessment about Russia’s interference in the 2016 elections.In picking Ms. Haspel to succeed Mr. Pompeo at the C.I.A., Mr. Trump opted for continuity rather than bringing in an outsider. At one point last fall, Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, one of the president’s closest Republican allies on Capitol Hill, had been tentatively tapped as the front-runner to run the agency if Mr. Pompeo moved up, but the idea later faded.Mr. Tillerson, a former chief executive of the oil giant Exxon Mobil, had once been viewed as an intriguing, if unorthodox, cabinet choice. He had deep experience with Middle Eastern potentates, and knew President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia through Exxon’s extensive efforts to explore for oil in Russia.But the early enthusiasm for bringing a business sensibility to the State Department faded fast, as Mr. Tillerson seemed overwhelmed by the diplomatic challenges before him and isolated by career foreign service officers whom he often froze out of the most important debates.His profound disagreements with the president on policy appeared to be his undoing: Mr. Tillerson wanted to remain part of the Paris climate accord; Mr. Trump decided to leave it. Mr. Tillerson supported the continuation of the Iran nuclear deal; Mr. Trump loathed the deal as “an embarrassment to the United States.” And Mr. Tillerson believed in dialogue to resolve the North Korean nuclear crisis, but Mr. Trump repeatedly threatened military options.Veteran diplomats said they could not remember a time when a president so regularly undermined his secretary of state so brazenly in the midst of a tense situation. Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations, who served many Republican presidents, last fall urged Mr. Tillerson to quit.“Rex Tillerson has been dealt a bad hand by the Potus & has played it badly,” Mr. Haass wrote in a post on Twitter, using the acronym for president of the United States. “For both reasons he cannot be effective SecState & should resign.”Career diplomats, who had seen in the gravelly voiced Mr. Tillerson a man of stature, experience and great wealth whom they hoped the president would respect and heed, eventually turned against him as he expressed more interest in shrinking the department than expanding American influence.While other cabinet officers made their goals plain, Mr. Tillerson never set clear diplomatic priorities other than to pursue Mr. Trump’s slogan of “America First,” a term he never really defined. In an odd admission more than eight months into the job, Mr. Tillerson told employees in September that his top priority was to make the State Department more efficient. Yet he never fully addressed what diplomats should be doing with that greater efficiency.Congress rebelled, declining to endorse his suggested 30 percent cuts in the State Department’s budget. But the message of his tenure seemed clear: At a moment when money was being poured into the Pentagon and intelligence agencies, diplomacy seemed less valued than at any time in recent American history.The turning point for Mr. Tillerson came when NBC News reported that he had called the president a “moron,” leading him to take the extraordinary step of holding a news conference to affirm his support for Mr. Trump and insist that he had never considered resigning.During a trip to Beijing in September, Mr. Tillerson told reporters that he already had “a couple, three” lines into North Korea to get communication started with the United States. Mr. Trump erupted the next morning, and denigrated the effort on Twitter by saying Mr. Tillerson was “wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man.”“Save your energy Rex,” he added, “we’ll do what has to be done!” Mr. Trump later said he wished his secretary of state were tougher. The Chinese were left to wonder why Mr. Trump sent an emissary whose message the president did not believe in.Part of the reason for Mr. Trump’s eruption then was that Mr. Tillerson’s suggestion of secret talks with North Korea surprised President Moon Jae-in of South Korea, who called the White House to complain, according to people with knowledge of the exchange. That Mr. Tillerson failed to take into account Seoul’s possible reaction was one of several embarrassing stumbles, arising from his own inexperience and decision to insulate himself from the department’s diplomatic corps.With his ousting, Mr. Tillerson joins a long list of Trump administration appointees who have left or been fired, including the president’s first national security adviser, chief of staff, chief strategist, press secretary, two White House communications directors and secretary of health and human services.Mr. Tillerson had some successes, including the growing international isolation of North Korea and improved ties between Saudi Arabia and Iraq. But he is likely to go down as among the least successful secretaries of state in history, and one big reason was his poor management of his relationship with Mr. Trump.Although Mr. Tillerson spent his first months on the job getting to know Mr. Trump at lunches, dinners and White House get-togethers, the two never established a comfortable rapport.Once the head of the Boy Scouts of America, Mr. Tillerson was outraged when the president spoke to the Boy Scouts in July and turned it into a political event. When Mr. Trump declined to denounce white nationalists who paraded in Charlottesville in August, Mr. Tillerson made it clear that Mr. Trump “speaks for himself” — not his secretary of state.The growing distance between the men was on clear display during Mr. Trump’s trip to Asia in November, when Mr. Tillerson visited the prison that once housed Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona who is a frequent critic of the president.But perhaps the most puzzling part of Mr. Tillerson’s tenure was his poor oversight of the State Department. As a former top business executive, his managerial skills were thought to be his chief asset.But he failed to quickly pick a trusted team of leaders, left many critical departments without direction and all but paralyzed crucial decision making in the department.He approved one global conclave in Washington just eight days before the event was to start, ensuring that few leaders from around the world were able to attend. He rarely sat for comprehensive briefings with many of his top diplomats and often failed to consult the State Department’s experts on countries before visiting.Foreign diplomats — starting with the British and the French — said Mr. Tillerson neither returned phone calls nor, with much advance warning, set up meetings with his counterparts. Strategic dialogues with many nations, including nuclear weapons powers like Pakistan, were ended without explanation.The State Department’s policymaking process devolved into conversations between Mr. Tillerson and a lone top aide, neither of whom had much experience or knowledge about many of the countries they discussed.Mr. Tillerson became so isolated that even top administration officials like Mr. Pompeo and allies like Condoleezza Rice, the former secretary of state whose recommendation was crucial to his selection, had trouble penetrating a phalanx of staff to speak to him directly.“The relationship between top management and the bulk of the State Department was toxic,” said Ambassador James F. Jeffrey, a former senior diplomat and fellow at the Washington Institute who once worked with Mr. Tillerson. “And that was a total mystery because the people at the State Department would work for the devil if he is advancing American interests, which Mr. Tillerson was.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/20/us/politics/dnc-russia-trump-lawsuit.html,"The Democratic National Committee opened a surprise legal assault on President Trump on Friday, filing a lawsuit in federal court alleging that the organization was the victim of a conspiracy by Russian officials, the Trump campaign and WikiLeaks to damage Hillary Clinton’s presidential run.The 66-page complaint, filed in federal court in New York, uses the publicly known facts of the investigation into Russia’s election meddling to accuse Mr. Trump’s associates of illegally working with Russian intelligence agents to interfere with the outcome of the election. In the document, the committee accuses Republicans and the Russians of “an act of previously unimaginable treachery.”The sweeping lawsuit startled Republicans in Washington as well as Democratic leaders, who were only briefed at the last minute about the D.N.C.’s plans to pursue civil litigation. Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic Party, said the committee had alerted Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the top Democrats in Congress, “when we were about to file.”Mr. Trump, in a tweet Friday evening, chided “obstructionist Democrats” for filing the complaint and suggested it could backfire if Republicans got access in court to the D.N.C.’s hacked email servers.Brad Parscale, the campaign manager for Mr. Trump’s 2020 re-election bid, called the D.N.C. allegations a “sham lawsuit about a bogus Russian collusion claim filed by a desperate, dysfunctional and nearly insolvent Democratic Party.”In a statement, Mr. Parscale accused Democrats of filing the lawsuit to drum up donations for the party. “They’ve sunk to a new low to raise money,” Mr. Parscale said.Denying any financial motivation, Mr. Perez said in an interview that the lawsuit had been taking shape for months, and recalled facing demands as early as the winter of 2017 to file suit against Mr. Trump for allegedly abetting foreign interference in an American election. He said he had instructed the committee to investigate that possibility, eventually engaging a plaintiffs’ law firm, Cohen Milstein, to assemble the complaint filed on Friday.While there are multiple ongoing investigations of Mr. Trump and his campaign, most significantly by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, Mr. Perez said the D.N.C. decided to move ahead with a civil suit because the committee believed there was an ongoing threat of foreign interference in American elections, and it was unclear when Mr. Mueller’s investigation might conclude. And certain claims in the lawsuit, he said, face statutory expiration dates.“I don’t know when Mueller will finish,” Mr. Perez said. “I’m very concerned about the run-up to the midterm elections.”Mr. Perez firmly denied that the lawsuit had a political purpose, but he appeared to allude at points to the possibility that civil litigation might bring to light damaging information about Mr. Trump and his associates.The complaint is largely based on information that has been disclosed in news reports and subsequent court proceedings. But if the lawsuit proceeds, the president and his campaign aides could be forced to disclose documents and submit to depositions that require them to answer questions under oath.To reach the discovery stage, lawsuits have to survive any motion to dismiss the litigation by the defendants.Mr. Perez suggested, for instance, that Mr. Trump’s tax returns would reveal “shady conduct” if they were ever made public. Asked if part of the lawsuit’s aim was to force such disclosures, Mr. Perez demurred: “I haven’t given that any thought.”In his statement deriding the suit, Mr. Parscale said that if the litigation proceeds, the Trump campaign would use discovery to seek out embarrassing information about Democrats, including Mr. Perez, and their handling of the 2016 presidential election.“There is a great deal the American public wants to know about the corruption of the Democrats,” Mr. Parscale said.White House officials and a number of other defendants did not immediately comment on the lawsuit. Roger J. Stone Jr., a former campaign adviser to Mr. Trump who is named as a defendant in the suit, dismissed it in an email as “a left-wing conspiracy theory dressed up as a lawsuit.”In a statement forwarded by Mr. Stone, Rob Buschel, Mr. Stone’s lawyer, said he had not yet been served with the D.N.C. suit and described it as a “regurgitation” of a complaint filed last year by Democrats alleging their privacy was invaded during the campaign. That litigation is still in progress.The Democrats’ legal maneuver comes amid a swirl of intensifying scrutiny of Mr. Trump, his associates and their interactions with Russia. The president, who has long denied allegations of collusion, has repeatedly attacked the special counsel investigation this week and has vented angrily about renewed claims by James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, that Mr. Trump sought to influence the bureau’s review of the election.Mr. Trump added Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former New York City mayor, and two other lawyers to his legal team this week. And on Thursday night, Mr. Trump thundered on social media that there was “NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION,” and again branded the whole Russia investigation as a “witch hunt.”The D.N.C. complaint is broad in its claims and stark in its language, naming a long list of defendants that includes Mr. Trump; his son, Donald Jr., and son-in-law, Jared Kushner; the Russian government and its intelligence service; and a group of former campaign aides including Mr. Stone, Paul Manafort, Rick Gates and George Papadopoulos.There is substantial overlap between the targets of the D.N.C. lawsuit and the group of people known to be under investigation by Mr. Mueller. Mr. Manafort has been indicted by the special counsel, while Mr. Gates and Mr. Papadopoulos have both pleaded guilty to different charges.The Democrats accused Mr. Trump’s campaign of being “a racketeering enterprise” that worked with the Russians and WikiLeaks in a conspiracy that included hacking email servers at the D.N.C. and leaking damaging information to the public. The Trump campaign had extensive warnings of the Russians’ activities and intentions, the Democrats allege, embraced the meddling of a foreign power.The lawsuit demands monetary damages and a declaration that the defendants conspired to alter the course of the election.Mr. Perez said that the party had not worked on the lawsuit with Democratic leaders on the intelligence committees in the House and Senate, who are investigating contacts between the Trump campaign and Russia through legislative investigations.The lawsuit is not the first attempt by Democrats to use civil litigation in an effort to open another path toward investigating what happened in 2016 that could be carried out under the oversight of a judge — even if President Trump were to shut down the special counsel’s criminal investigation and the congressional oversight probes, run by Republicans, were to fall short.Last July, two Democratic donors and a former staffer member filed an invasion of privacy lawsuit against Mr. Trump’s campaign and Mr. Stone. It also accused them of conspiring in the release of hacked Democratic emails and files that exposed their personal information to the public.The timing of that earlier filing came just before a one-year statute of limitations for privacy invasion lawsuits was about to expire; WikiLeaks published the first archives of stolen Democratic National Committee emails on July 22, 2016.The privacy invasion case was organized by Protect Democracy, a government watchdog group run by former Obama administration lawyers.In a statement, Protect Democracy on Friday noted that the new D.N.C. lawsuit draws on the same set of underlying facts as the earlier privacy-invasion litigation it brought on behalf of “three Americans whose personal information was exposed through a conspiracy involving the Trump campaign and Roger Stone.” It said it only learned about the existence of the D.N.C. lawsuit from press reports on Friday.The nine-month-old privacy invasion lawsuit is much further developed than the D.N.C. case. The judge overseeing it, Ellen S. Huvelle of the Federal District Court for the District of Columbia, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, has scheduled a May 17 hearing on the defendants’ motions to dismiss."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/28/nyregion/senator-menendez-election-new-jersey.html,"UNION CITY, N.J. — Senator Robert Menendez officially announced his intention to run for re-election at a raucous rally on Wednesday, a remarkable turn two months after federal prosecutors dismissed corruption charges against the New Jersey Democrat.With nearly every state Democratic luminary inside a packed high school gymnasium here, it was an unusual show of force for a candidate who already enjoys a considerable lead in early polling.In his kickoff speech, sometimes delivered in Spanish, Mr. Menendez vowed that he would continue to fight against President Trump’s agenda.“There is a president in Washington who spends his days dividing us and distracting us, but never delivering for us,” Mr. Menendez said, drawing some of his loudest cheers.In January, it was far from assured that Mr. Menendez would even be on the stage. For 11 weeks last year, the senator was a defendant in a federal corruption trial with headlines tracing the prosecution’s case, which accused him of abusing his office to help his friend and co-defendant, Dr. Salomon Melgen, an eye doctor and political benefactor from Florida.But after jurors could not reach a verdict, the judge declared a mistrial and Mr. Menendez pronounced himself vindicated. Then the situation quickly changed. First, the Department of Justice announced that it would retry Mr. Menendez. Then the federal judge who oversaw the trial acquitted Mr. Menendez of several charges, severely hampering the retrial effort. Within days, the Department of Justice had dropped the case.If Mr. Menendez was ever worried about his political future, he seemed determined to dispel any notion of that on Wednesday. His campaign playlist featured numbers like “The Champion” by Carrie Underwood and “I Won’t Back Down” by Tom Petty.The people lining the rows in front of the stage at the rally, in the town where he began his political career, were a who’s who of New Jersey Democratic politics: Senator Cory Booker, Gov. Philip D. Murphy, Brian P. Stack, the mayor of Union City, and John Currie, the state party chairman.“I asked the question this morning, ‘Where would we be without Bob Menendez?’ ” Mr. Murphy said.While none of the speakers made explicit reference to Mr. Menendez’s legal battle, a common theme emerged: that the senator was, and always has been, “a fighter.”“This is the man that we need in this fight,” said Mr. Booker, whose 10-minute introduction reached such a crescendo that his voice grew hoarse. “This is the man who will help us to stand against the storm, this is the man that is ready to continue to defend the State of New Jersey.”Nearly the entire 2,800-student population of Union City High School, excused from four periods of classes, filled the gymnasium, waving campaign fliers and bopping to the music of Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi.Mr. Menendez focused much of his speech on the youth in the crowd, recalling the nationwide protests for stronger gun laws and how the students at the School had their own protest. It was the youth, he said, that motivated him to run again.“While some of you are not old enough to vote, I am not here to ask for your vote, I am here because I am your vote in the United States Senate,” he said.Mr. Menendez’s path to the Democratic nomination is fairly clear. If successful, his likely Republican opponent in the general election will be Bob Hugin, a former pharmaceutical executive with ties to former Gov. Chris Christie. Mr. Hugin’s ability to tap his fortune to finance his campaign could make the contest expensive and possibly more competitive than expected.The race could also turn nasty. At the rally, members of the state Republican Party handed out Monopoly-like cards with Mr. Menendez’s face on a cartoon prisoner and a photo of Mr. Menendez and Mr. Melgen vacationing together.If Mr. Menendez’s corruption trial dampened enthusiasm among Democrats it could spell trouble for other Democratic candidates in November. Democrats across the country are looking to House races in New Jersey as opportunities to pick up seats as they seek to wrest control from Republicans, but Democrats in those races will need a strong turnout to stand a chance.For his part, Mr. Menendez has a keen understanding of local politics, having climbed nearly every rung on the political ladder, from school board member to mayor to state senator to congressman to United States senator, a position he assumed in 2005, when he was appointed by Gov. Jon S. Corzine.He has been re-elected twice, in 2006 and 2012, and has been a prolific fund-raiser, having raised $17 million for his 2012 re-election, according to Federal Election Commission records.Mr. Menendez on Wednesday referred to his roots and a career that started in this city’s school district as evidence of an American dream fulfilled.“That is the promise of America,” he said, offering a subtle dig at Mr. Trump’s immigration policies. “That is the American dream. The idea that anything is possible because everyone is welcome.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/09/us/politics/trump-mueller-ukraine-victor-pinchuk.html,"WASHINGTON — The special counsel is investigating a payment made to President Trump’s foundation by a Ukrainian steel magnate for a talk during the campaign, according to three people briefed on the matter, as part of a broader examination of streams of foreign money to Mr. Trump and his associates in the years leading up to the election.Investigators subpoenaed the Trump Organization this year for an array of records about business with foreign nationals. In response, the company handed over documents about a $150,000 donation that the Ukrainian billionaire, Victor Pinchuk, made in September 2015 to the Donald J. Trump Foundation in exchange for a 20-minute appearance by Mr. Trump that month through a video link to a conference in Kiev.Michael D. Cohen, the president’s personal lawyer whose office and hotel room were raided on Monday in an apparently unrelated case, solicited the donation. The contribution from Mr. Pinchuk, who has sought closer ties for Ukraine to the West, was the largest the foundation received in 2015 from anyone besides Mr. Trump himself.The subpoena is among signs in recent months that the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is interested in interactions that Mr. Trump or his associates had with countries beyond Russia, though it is not clear what other payments he is scrutinizing.Mr. Mueller also ordered the Trump Organization to turn over documents, emails and other communications about several Russians, including some whose names have not been publicly tied to Mr. Trump, according to the three people, who would not be named discussing the ongoing investigation. The identities of the Russians were unclear.The payment from Mr. Pinchuk “is curious because it comes during a campaign and is from a foreigner and looks like an effort to buy influence,” said Marcus S. Owens, a former head of the Internal Revenue Service division that oversees tax-exempt organizations. He called the donation “an unusual amount of money for such a short speech.”Mr. Cohen did not respond to a request for comment. Jay Sekulow, a lawyer for the president, did not return several messages seeking comment, nor did a lawyer for the Trump Organization. When The New York Times revealed the existence of the subpoena in March, Mr. Trump’s associates played it down as a routine court order to ensure the Trump Organization had handed over all the documents Mr. Mueller had demanded.Mr. Trump assailed the special counsel investigation on Monday as a “witch hunt,” reaching for a favored insult in response to the seizure of Mr. Cohen’s records. He complained that he had cooperated with the inquiry and viewed the warrant for the raid, obtained by federal prosecutors in Manhattan after a referral from Mr. Mueller, as an extreme step.“It’s a disgraceful situation,” he told reporters at the White House. “It’s a total witch hunt. I’ve been saying it for a long time. I’ve wanted to keep it down. I’ve given over a million pages in documents to the special counsel.”Mr. Mueller has also examined a deal Mr. Cohen was putting together with Mr. Trump to build a Trump Tower in Moscow. Mr. Trump said last summer that Mr. Mueller should not look at his or his family’s finances beyond issues related directly to Russia.But the special counsel’s investigators have questioned witnesses about whether money from the Persian Gulf had been used to finance Mr. Trump’s political efforts and asked for information on Mr. Pinchuk.The inquiry into the Trump Organization’s payments from foreign nationals underscores how diffuse Mr. Trump’s sources of income have been over many years. And the destination of Mr. Pinchuk’s donation — the Trump Foundation instead of the president’s personal coffers — raised fresh questions about how the president handled the entity he set up to deal with charitable giving.Mr. Trump’s foundation attracted scrutiny during the 2016 campaign over revelations about his lack of financial support for it and his use of it to pay legal settlements rather than fulfill pledges he made to give to charity. In 2007, Mr. Trump used $20,000 from the foundation to buy a six-foot-tall portrait of himself.Two weeks after he was elected president, the foundation acknowledged in a tax form that it might have broken federal rules designed to prohibit self-dealing, when charities use their money to benefit principals in their organization.In the same filing, the foundation disclosed the donation from Mr. Pinchuk for Mr. Trump’s video appearance.Mr. Pinchuk is the son-in-law of a former president of Ukraine, Leonid Kuchma, who from 1994 to 2005 led a government criticized for corruption, nepotism and the murder of dissident journalists. Mr. Pinchuk, who has been accused by steel makers in the United States of illegally dumping steel on the American market at artificially low prices, drew more scrutiny during the campaign for his ties to Hillary Clinton and her family foundation. He has donated more than $13 million to that organization since 2006.Mr. Trump’s appearance was broadcast at the Yalta European Strategy conference, which promotes pro-European Union policies for Ukraine. Through his own foundation, Mr. Pinchuk sponsors the affair, which typically attracts well-known former Western leaders like former Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and former President Bill Clinton. It was moved to Kiev after Russia’s annexation of Crimea in 2014.In a statement, the Victor Pinchuk Foundation said it reached out to Mr. Trump and other world leaders to help “promote strengthened and enduring ties between Ukraine and the West.”The foundation said the donation was “a specific request of Mr. Trump Foundation in September of 2015 when there were multiple candidates for the Republican nomination for president and it was by no means assured that Mr. Trump would be the Republican nominee in 2016.”At the time, Mr. Trump occupied an unusual position in the presidential race. Though he was the Republican front-runner, the primary field was crowded and he was being vetted or seriously considered by few, if any, in the news media or the Republican establishment.The event, his first foray into global politics during the campaign, was set up by Doug Schoen, a veteran political consultant and pollster who works with Mr. Pinchuk, according to a person familiar with how the speech was arranged. Mr. Schoen, a frequent Fox News guest, has known Mr. Trump for years and contacted him personally to set it up at the end of August 2015, according to the person.Mr. Trump did not raise the prospect of any payment. But the next day, Mr. Cohen called Mr. Schoen to solicit the $150,000 as an honorarium, the person briefed on the matter said. Mr. Schoen, who had gotten to know Mr. Cohen by running into him in the green room at Fox News, dealt with him and not Mr. Trump directly, according to another person briefed on the exchange.The Kiev talk received little attention, with the scant coverage focused on the awkward nature of Mr. Trump’s delivery. He repeatedly stopped speaking, apparently believing he had to pause to give translators time to relay what he was saying.“You need not wait for any translation,” Mr. Schoen finally told him.Mr. Trump continued to pause and said he was having trouble hearing. “The sound system is terrible because there is a huge delay and feedback,” he said.Mr. Trump used the appearance to criticize President Barack Obama amid deteriorating relations between the United States and Russia over its incursions into Ukraine, which had begun a year earlier. “Our president is not strong and he is not doing what he should be doing for the Ukraine,” Mr. Trump said, using the article before Ukraine, which is seen as insulting by some Ukrainians.“Putin does not respect our president whatsoever,” he said of President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.Ukraine, once a part of the Soviet Union, has been at the center of another part of Mr. Mueller’s inquiry. He is investigating the consulting work done in Kiev by Mr. Trump’s former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, for the country’s pro-Russian former president, Viktor F. Yanukovych. Mr. Manafort has pleaded not guilty to charges of tax fraud and other financial crimes.He resigned from Mr. Trump’s campaign in August 2016 after handwritten ledgers were made public showing that he received $12.7 million in undisclosed cash payments from Mr. Yanukovych’s pro-Russian political party from 2007 to 2012."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/15/us/politics/trump-campaign-fec-financial-reports.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump’s re-election campaign has ramped up its fund-raising this year, bringing in $20.2 million, while investing heavily in cultivating a wide base of small donors, according to reports filed Sunday afternoon with the Federal Election Commission.Mr. Trump’s campaign apparatus spent nearly $8.2 million through the end of last month, with more than 60 percent of that going toward low-dollar fund-raising tools such as solicitations delivered via social media, email, direct mail and telemarketing, the reports show.The reports were filed by Mr. Trump’s campaign and two joint committees it formed with the Republican National Committee: Trump Victory Committee and Trump Make America Great Again Committee.The committees also spent $863,000 on legal fees as Mr. Trump, his campaign and associates continue to deal with a handful of legal fights, as well as the special counsel investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign.But that legal spending paled in comparison with the more than $5.2 million spent on fund-raising revealed in the reports. Taken together, they reveal that, even as some major Republican donors have warmed to Mr. Trump, his political operation is not abandoning the approach that carried it through much of the 2016 campaign, when it relied primarily on a stream of donations from small donors giving online.Mr. Trump’s commitment to that approach seemed to be affirmed in February when he announced as his re-election campaign manager Brad Parscale, who championed a social media-driven operation in 2016, when he served as digital director.During the first three months of this year, Mr. Parscale’s firm was paid $1.7 million for digital consulting and online advertising, according to Sunday’s reports. Much of that was probably passed through to website and social media platforms, though the campaign also paid Facebook $4,700 for ads directly.An additional $2.3 million was spent on direct mail, which is typically used to solicit small and medium-size donations, while $210,000 went to a collection of eight fund-raising consultants, and $158,000 was spent on telemarketing.The committees spent nearly $700,000 on merchandise offered for sale to supporters primarily through Mr. Trump’s campaign website, with $204,000 of that going at least partially for hats — presumably including the red “Make America Great Again” hats that became emblematic of Mr. Trump’s campaign.The investment in low-dollar fund-raising is already paying dividends. More than half of the total raised by the three committees this year came from donors who gave $200 or less, the reports show.To be sure, the Trump Victory committee, which was created to raise big checks from major donors, did raise $4.9 million from more than 60 donors who gave $20,000 or more each, including $250,000 checks from the Wisconsin industrialist Elizabeth Uihlein, the Alaska investor Robert B. Gillam and the Las Vegas restaurateur Craig Estey and his wife, Patricia.A third of the committees’ $863,000 in legal fees went to two firms involved in the legal fight with the adult film star known as Stormy Daniels. Those firms — Harder LLP and Larocca, Hornik, Rosen, Greenberg & Blaha — were paid a combined $280,000. A campaign official said the payments were not related to Ms. Daniels.Another $376,000 was paid to Jones Day, the firm representing the campaign on election law and campaign finance compliance, as well as matters related to the investigation of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III.Mr. Trump’s committees also continued to pay his businesses for a variety of functions, including nearly $58,000 in rent and $59,000 in facility rental and catering services to the Trump International Hotel in Washington.The three Trump committees ended March with $44.3 million in the bank."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/18/us/politics/tennessee-senate-race-bredesen-blackburn.html,"KNOXVILLE, Tenn. — President Trump won 92 of Tennessee’s 95 counties in the 2016 election, making this state a seemingly daunting target for Democrats hoping to flip a seat in the Senate.But a decade before that commanding victory, another politician won an even bigger landslide. The state’s Democratic governor, Phil Bredesen, swept all 95 counties to win a second term.Now Mr. Bredesen is running for the Senate seat being vacated by a Republican, Bob Corker, and his track record makes him the rarest of Democrats: a formidable non-incumbent candidate in a solidly Republican state who can allow his party to go on the offensive in an improbable place.“There have to be hundreds of thousands of people who voted for me and voted for Donald Trump,” Mr. Bredesen said in a recent interview after meeting with a group of doctoral students from the Bredesen Center, a partnership between the University of Tennessee and Oak Ridge National Laboratory that is named for him. Over breakfast at a restaurant here, Mr. Bredesen and the students talked about subjects like nuclear power, supercomputing and research funding.There is early evidence of his strength, or at least fond memories of his time in office: A poll released this month by Middle Tennessee State University found Mr. Bredesen with a 10-point lead over his expected Republican opponent, Representative Marsha Blackburn. Twenty percent of Republican voters said they would vote for Mr. Bredesen.Republican voters in Tennessee “don’t consider him an evil liberal person,” said Victor H. Ashe, a Republican and former longtime mayor of Knoxville. He predicted a tight race and said Ms. Blackburn could not afford to lose a significant chunk of Republican voters.In a nominal show of support for Ms. Blackburn, Mr. Corker wrote on Twitter last week that he was sending a donation to her campaign and wished her well in the Senate race. But in a brief interview, he said he would not campaign against Mr. Bredesen, recounting their long history working together and describing him as a friend.“He was a very good mayor, very good governor, very good businessperson,” Mr. Corker said, adding, “He would be successful at anything that he did and is someone I consider to be very thoughtful.”But there is ample reason for skepticism about Mr. Bredesen’s chances: No Democrat has won a statewide race in Tennessee since his successful re-election bid in 2006, and the state has turned more Republican since then. He will have to avoid being portrayed as being in lock step with national Democratic figures like Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as the top Democrats in Congress, Senator Chuck Schumer of New York and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California.Ms. Blackburn and her allies “know that Bredesen is popular; they know that the national brand of the Democratic Party is not,” said Kent Syler, who teaches at Middle Tennessee State and was a longtime aide to the former Democratic congressman Bart Gordon. “So they will work very hard to connect him to that national brand, and he will work very hard to avoid that.”Mr. Bredesen, 74, jumped into the race after Mr. Corker, a two-term Republican, decided to retire. A wealthy former health care executive who served as mayor of Nashville before becoming governor, Mr. Bredesen said he concluded that he was probably the only Democrat who would have a reasonable shot at winning the seat. In a video announcing his candidacy, he reminded voters of the successes of his tenure, including reining in the soaring cost of TennCare, the state’s Medicaid program, which had been financially troubled.His decision to run for the Senate was a coup for Democrats in Washington who have been mapping out how to flip control of the chamber in November’s elections, even as their caucus defends 26 seats, 10 in states won by Mr. Trump, while the Republicans must guard only nine. Once seen as far-fetched, winning a majority is at least mathematically possible, especially after a Democrat, Doug Jones, won a special election in Alabama in December.Skepticism of a Democratic takeover of the Senate has come from an unlikely voice in Tennessee: Mr. Bredesen. To Republicans who suggest a vote for him is a vote to make Mr. Schumer the majority leader, he pushed back on the idea.“I don’t think it’s possible, I’ll be honest with you,” he said, naming Florida, Missouri and North Dakota as states where Democratic incumbents could be in danger. “My expectation is that I will be in the minority in the Senate.”Mr. Bredesen is walking a careful line when it comes to Mr. Trump, who defeated Mrs. Clinton by 26 percentage points in Tennessee. “Look, I’m not running against Donald Trump,” he says in a television commercial that is textbook Bredesen sobriety.In the interview, he emphasized his attentiveness to rural voters who feel as if elected leaders are not doing anything to help them, recalling his own upbringing in upstate New York and offering a pointed critique of today’s Democratic Party.“My party, I think, has gotten way too far to the left and needs to learn how to win elections,” he said. “I think we Democrats have gotten too elitist. We’ve gotten too narrow. We’ve gotten too involved in litmus tests.”He continued: “I’d like to belong to a church that’s bringing new members in, not routing out dissidents or heretics or something like that, and I’m afraid we’ve gotten too much in the latter.”Still, there are clear policy differences between Mr. Bredesen and the president. Mr. Bredesen said Mr. Trump’s promised wall along the border with Mexico was “political theater, not anything practical.” He also criticized the Republican tax overhaul for providing “crumbs” to the middle class — echoing a description previously used by Ms. Pelosi that Republicans eagerly seized on.“I think they did something which was clever politically, but I couldn’t have swallowed morally, which is I think they threw a few crumbs to the middle class to give these huge breaks to wealthier people and corporations and so on,” Mr. Bredesen said. “And I think I would have called that out as strongly as I possibly could have.”Ms. Blackburn speaks proudly of the tax overhaul, and she has allowed little distance between her and Mr. Trump.“What we need in the U.S. Senate is a senator who is going to stand with President Donald Trump,” she told the crowd at a county Republican Party dinner in Murfreesboro this month, where a handful of young supporters wore red T-shirts that said “Marsha Marsha Marsha” on the back.First elected to Congress in 2002 after serving as a state senator, Ms. Blackburn, 65, is a frequent presence on cable news channels. She has been a leading opponent of abortion, overseeing a House panel that investigated Planned Parenthood and the sale of fetal tissue for medical research. She once debated climate change with the television personality Bill Nye.In a video announcing her candidacy, she described herself as a “hard-core, card-carrying Tennessee conservative,” spoke of carrying a gun in her purse, declared she was “politically incorrect” and said, with a note of pride, that liberals call her a “wing nut.”But Ms. Blackburn’s full-throated conservatism is distinctive compared with the relatively moderate tone of Republicans whom Tennessee voters have sent to the Senate in the past — a group that includes Howard H. Baker Jr., a former Senate majority leader who became known as “the great conciliator”; another majority leader, Bill Frist; Mr. Corker; and Tennessee’s senior senator, Lamar Alexander.In a Vanderbilt University poll conducted last year, 76 percent of Tennessee voters said they preferred that their legislators worked with the other party, even if it meant compromising on some of their values.Ms. Blackburn is sending a different message. “Real conservative leadership,” promises a palm card for her campaign. “No compromise, no apologies.”Representative Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Memphis, questioned whether Tennessee voters would embrace a candidate in that mold over someone with a middle-of-the-road, business-friendly image.“We’ve never had a politician on that level of anybody that’s been kind of mocked for their antediluvian ways,” he said.Ms. Blackburn suggested that people in Tennessee needed to get accustomed to the idea of being represented in the Senate by a woman.“This is one of the things that you’ll hear people talk about from time to time, because Tennessee’s never had a female senator,” she said. “So it is going to be a little bit different, if you will. An approach will be different.”Then there is the unresolved question of just how much Ms. Blackburn will be able to exploit Mr. Bredesen’s party affiliation — even if Mr. Bredesen himself is not eager to dwell on it.Voters may have fond memories of Mr. Bredesen as governor, but will they want to help expand the ranks of the Senate Democratic caucus? Mr. Schumer personally courted Mr. Bredesen to run.“You can’t talk one way at home and go to D.C. and support Chuck Schumer and expect that to be what the people of this state want,” Ms. Blackburn told the crowd in Murfreesboro. “And let me tell you something: Chuck Schumer as majority leader would be an absolute disaster.”Mr. Bredesen scoffed at the idea that he would fall in line with Mr. Schumer, noting that he has a history of breaking with his party, including over the Affordable Care Act, which he roundly criticized.“I’ve got a pretty good reputation as somebody who does not toe the party line on everything, which I think will help get through that,” Mr. Bredesen said of his opponent’s line of attack. “I’ve certainly made no commitments to be supportive of Chuck Schumer or anything else.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/mueller-special-counsel-legislation-senate.html,"WASHINGTON — Senator Mitch McConnell’s unilateral declaration this week that he would not allow a vote on legislation to protect the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, provoked outrage from Democrats who said Mr. McConnell was giving President Trump carte blanche to oust the leader of the investigation into Russian election interference and the president’s inner circle.In reality, the bipartisan bill would stand little chance of passage even if Mr. McConnell, the Kentucky Republican and majority leader, relented and allowed it to be debated and approved by the Senate. House Republicans are adamantly opposed. And if the bill somehow cleared Congress, Mr. Trump would have no incentive to sign a measure limiting his power. On top of that, the legislation might not be constitutional.But supporters of the bill are pressing ahead anyway, intensifying a dispute that underscores both rising concern among Republicans that Mr. Trump might fire Mr. Mueller and uncertainty about just how they would react if he did.Mr. McConnell’s stance has serious consequences. Backers of the legislation believe that a strong Senate show of support for Mr. Mueller and his inquiry would send an unmistakable signal to Mr. Trump that dismissing Mr. Mueller would present serious complications for his presidency.“It would send a message,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who recently endorsed the special counsel proposal written by two Republican senators, Thom Tillis of North Carolina and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, and two Democratic senators, Chris Coons of Delaware and Cory Booker of New Jersey.Republicans both inside and outside the government warn that firing Mr. Mueller would be very unwise.“You need to leave him alone, let him do his job and get it over with,” said Saxby Chambliss, a retired senator from Georgia who was the top Republican on the Intelligence Committee and talks frequently with his former colleagues about Mr. Trump and the special counsel. “The president keeps slamming Mueller, and I think that politically just doesn’t play well, even with folks I know who are part of the president’s base.”Mr. McConnell’s argument has consistently been that such legislation is not needed because Mr. Trump will not take action against Mr. Mueller. But the president’s increasing anger and frustration about the inquiry has other Republicans joining Democrats in worrying that the counsel might be about to lose his job. Although top Republicans have said there would be significant blowback, it remains unclear what steps would be taken beyond admonishment and hand-wringing.One top Senate Republican acknowledged privately that there may be little else the party would do. Any move toward impeachment seems out of the question in the Republican-controlled Congress. Conservatives in the House are instead demanding an end to the Mueller inquiry.While the Senate could censure the president, it is doubtful Republicans would take that action before midterm elections in which they will be relying on Trump supporters to help them hold the Senate. It has been done only once before, in the case of Andrew Jackson (coincidentally a Trump favorite), and was later reversed.Another Republican suggested that the Senate could refuse to consider Justice Department nominees unless the president agreed to the naming of a new counsel, a reaction Democrats would consider woefully insufficient. Democrats fear they might not learn the Republican reaction until after the president takes his own action.“Why not head off a constitutional crisis at the pass, rather than waiting until it’s too late?” Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, said Thursday in calling for approval of the special counsel legislation. “Why even flirt with the prospect of a president challenging the very nature of our system of government?”Democrats are just as concerned that Mr. Trump and House Republicans are building a separate case for firing Rod J. Rosenstein, the deputy attorney general, who is overseeing the investigation as a result of the decision by Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself. They fear that a move against Mr. Rosenstein would not grab as much attention as dismissing Mr. Mueller and that Mr. Rosenstein’s successor could then constrain the inquiry.Pressed again Wednesday evening at a news conference about whether he intended to fire either of them, Mr. Trump repeated his denunciation of the idea of collusion between Russia and his campaign as a hoax and called for the inquiry to be wrapped up. “As far as the two gentlemen you told me about, they’ve been saying I’m going to get rid of them for the last three months, four months, five months,” he said. “And they’re still here.”Despite Mr. McConnell’s resistance, Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee, still plans for his panel to take up the special counsel bill next week. It appears to have a strong chance of receiving the committee’s approval.“The views of the majority leader are important to consider, but they do not govern what happens here on the Judiciary Committee,” Mr. Grassley said Thursday.Mr. McConnell has previously demonstrated that he is willing to bottle up a bill he believes could divide Senate Republicans or prove politically problematic, even if it has bipartisan support from members of the Judiciary Committee. In 2016, he refused to take up a criminal justice overhaul that could have passed the Senate with the backing of Mr. Grassley and many other Republicans, citing objections from a handful of conservatives.Mr. Tillis and his allies say they still hope to sway Mr. McConnell. “It’s on us to convince the leader that it’s a worthwhile effort,” Mr. Tillis said. “We’ve got to get the votes, and that will come if we get a successful outcome out of Judiciary.”The fight over the measure is taking place as James B. Comey, the former F.B.I. director, continues a high-profile media tour promoting his tell-all about clashes with Mr. Trump. Ms. Collins and other Republicans say they have found the entire exercise unseemly and damaging to the F.B.I. They contrasted Mr. Comey’s performance with what they say is the professionalism being exhibited by Mr. Mueller, a man well known to many lawmakers from his time at the F.B.I. and Justice Department.“James Comey is no Bob Mueller,” Ms. Collins said.Now she and many others are eager to protect Mr. Mueller from suffering Mr. Comey’s fate — fired by Mr. Trump over the Russia investigation."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"Stocks were driven sharply higher on the last day of the year by signs that a resolution to the fiscal negotiations in Washington could come within days.Traders hung on every word out of Washington on Monday, sending share prices on a jerky path upward on what is usually a quiet day of trading ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday.It ended up being the best day for American stocks since the middle of November and was enough to push leading indexes into positive territory for December. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished the day up 1.7 percent, bringing the year’s gains to 13.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3 percent for the day and 7.3 percent for 2012.The government was expected to go over the so-called fiscal cliff on Monday night, when a package of tax increases and spending cuts was set to start being phased in. But the political signals out of Washington convinced many investors that the White House and Congress would avert the changes that would be most damaging to the economy. “By day’s end, the assumption was that a deal was in hand — minor details needed to be worked out, but a finished product would be in the books within the next few days,” said Daniel Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. “Investors that had spent the last couple of days trading down reversed that trend and took things higher.” Late Monday evening, a tentative deal was reached that would raise taxes on incomes above $400,000.The market’s jump, much of which occurred after an early-afternoon news conference by President Obama, brought an unexpected end to a day that began with continuing bickering in Washington and a sense of foreboding on Wall Street. Stocks had fallen steadily for most of the last week and opened the day trading down.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the leader of the Republican minority, said late in the day that an agreement was “very, very close.”Stocks could easily lose their gains if either chamber of Congress is unable to pass the compromise that was being negotiated on Monday. Senators said they were hoping to agree upon legislation and pass it along to the House for a vote on Tuesday. Some details of the agreement were still unclear, and the Republican-controlled House could demand changes.The stock markets are closed on Tuesday, and most traders will be back at their desk Wednesday morning after a week of vacations and light trading.Even if there is an agreement, it is unlikely to resolve a separate debate over the limit on the amount the government can borrow. The government hit its self-imposed debt ceiling on Monday, and Treasury Department officials have said they will be able to finance the budget for only a few weeks using emergency measures.Some Republicans have said they want to use the debate over the debt ceiling to extract more spending cuts from Democrats. Investors are preparing for another bout of volatile trading if that happens.The year did end with many market strategists in an optimistic mood about the American economy, once the fiscal talks in Washington are out of the way.“While fiscal policy and political gridlock are negatives, there are other factors that remain supportive of growth, including a modest recovery in housing and further improvements in household balance sheets,” BlackRock’s chief investment strategist, Russ Koesterich, said in a note to clients.The Standard & Poor’s 500 index climbed 1.7 percent, or 23.76 points, to 1,426.19. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3 percent, or 166.03 points, to 13,104.14. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2 percent, or 59.20 points, to 3,019.51."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/opinion/the-emancipation-of-abe-lincoln.html,"ONE hundred and fifty years ago, on Jan. 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln presided over the annual White House New Year’s reception. Late that afternoon, he retired to his study to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. When he took up his pen, his hand was shaking from exhaustion. Briefly, he paused — “I do not want it to appear as if I hesitated,” he remarked. Then Lincoln affixed a firm signature to the document.Like all great historical transformations, emancipation was a process, not a single event. It arose from many causes and was the work of many individuals. It began at the outset of the Civil War, when slaves sought refuge behind Union lines. It did not end until December 1865, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which irrevocably abolished slavery throughout the nation.But the Emancipation Proclamation was the crucial turning point in this story. In a sense, it embodied a double emancipation: for the slaves, since it ensured that if the Union emerged victorious, slavery would perish, and for Lincoln himself, for whom it marked the abandonment of his previous assumptions about how to abolish slavery and the role blacks would play in post-emancipation American life.There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Lincoln’s statement in 1864 that he had always believed slavery to be wrong. During the first two years of the Civil War, despite insisting that the conflict’s aim was preservation of the Union, he devoted considerable energy to a plan for ending slavery inherited from prewar years. Emancipation would be undertaken by state governments, with national financing. It would be gradual, owners would receive monetary compensation and emancipated slaves would be encouraged to find a homeland outside the United States — this last idea known as “colonization.”Lincoln’s plan sought to win the cooperation of slave holders in ending slavery. As early as November 1861, he proposed it to political leaders in Delaware, one of the four border states (along with Kentucky, Maryland and Missouri) that remained in the Union. Delaware had only 1,800 slaves; the institution was peripheral to the state’s economy. But Lincoln found that even there, slave holders did not wish to surrender their human property. Nonetheless, for most of 1862, he avidly promoted his plan to the border states and any Confederates who might be interested.Lincoln also took his proposal to black Americans. In August 1862, he met with a group of black leaders from Washington. He seemed to blame the presence of blacks in America for the conflict: “but for your race among us there could not be war.” He issued a powerful indictment of slavery — “the greatest wrong inflicted on any people” — but added that, because of racism, blacks would never achieve equality in America. “It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated,” he said. But most blacks refused to contemplate emigration from the land of their birth.In the summer of 1862, a combination of events propelled Lincoln in a new direction. Slavery was disintegrating in parts of the South as thousands of slaves ran away to Union lines. With the war a stalemate, more Northerners found themselves agreeing with the abolitionists, who had insisted from the outset that slavery must become a target. Enthusiasm for enlistment was waning in the North. The Army had long refused to accept black volunteers, but the reservoir of black manpower could no longer be ignored. In response, Congress moved ahead of Lincoln, abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia, authorizing the president to enroll blacks in the Army and freeing the slaves of pro-Confederate owners in areas under military control. Lincoln signed all these measures that summer.The hallmark of Lincoln’s greatness was his combination of bedrock principle with open-mindedness and capacity for growth. That summer, with his preferred approach going nowhere, he moved in the direction of immediate emancipation. He first proposed this to his cabinet on July 22, but Secretary of State William H. Seward persuaded him to wait for a military victory, lest it seem an act of desperation.Soon after the Union victory at Antietam in September, Lincoln issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, a warning to the Confederacy that if it did not lay down its arms by Jan. 1, he would declare the slaves “forever free.”Lincoln did not immediately abandon his earlier plan. His annual message to Congress, released on Dec. 1, 1862, devoted a long passage to gradual, compensated abolition and colonization. But in the same document, without mentioning the impending proclamation, he indicated that a new approach was imperative: “The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present,” he wrote. “We must disenthrall our selves, and then we shall save our country.” Lincoln included himself in that “we.” On Jan. 1, he proclaimed the freedom of the vast majority of the nation’s slaves.The Emancipation Proclamation is perhaps the most misunderstood of the documents that have shaped American history. Contrary to legend, Lincoln did not free the nearly four million slaves with a stroke of his pen. It had no bearing on slaves in the four border states, since they were not in rebellion. It also exempted certain parts of the Confederacy occupied by the Union. All told, it left perhaps 750,000 slaves in bondage. But the remaining 3.1 million, it declared, “are, and henceforward shall be free.”The proclamation did not end slavery in the United States on the day it was issued. Indeed, it could not even be enforced in most of the areas where it applied, which were under Confederate control. But it ensured the eventual death of slavery — assuming the Union won the war. Were the Confederacy to emerge victorious, slavery, in one form or another, would undoubtedly have lasted a long time.A military order, whose constitutional legitimacy rested on the president’s war powers, the proclamation often disappoints those who read it. It is dull and legalistic; it contains no soaring language enunciating the rights of man. Only at the last minute, at the urging of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, an abolitionist, did Lincoln add a conclusion declaring the proclamation an “act of justice.”Nonetheless, the proclamation marked a dramatic transformation in the nature of the Civil War and in Lincoln’s own approach to the problem of slavery. No longer did he seek the consent of slave holders. The proclamation was immediate, not gradual, contained no mention of compensation for owners, and made no reference to colonization.In it, Lincoln addressed blacks directly, not as property subject to the will of others but as men and women whose loyalty the Union must earn. For the first time, he welcomed black soldiers into the Union Army; over the next two years some 200,000 black men would serve in the Army and Navy, playing a critical role in achieving Union victory. And Lincoln urged freed slaves to go to work for “reasonable wages” — in the United States. He never again mentioned colonization in public.Having made the decision, Lincoln did not look back. In 1864, with casualties mounting, there was talk of a compromise peace. Some urged Lincoln to rescind the proclamation, in which case, they believed, the South could be persuaded to return to the Union. Lincoln refused. Were he to do so, he told one visitor, “I should be damned in time and eternity.”Wartime emancipation may have settled the fate of slavery, but it opened another vexing question: the role of former slaves in American life. Colonization had allowed its proponents to talk about abolition without having to confront this issue; after all, the black population would be gone. After Jan. 1, 1863, Lincoln for the first time began to think seriously of the United States as a biracial society.While not burdened with the visceral racism of many of his white contemporaries, Lincoln shared some of their prejudices. He had long seen blacks as an alien people who had been unjustly uprooted from their homeland and were entitled to freedom, but were not an intrinsic part of American society. During his Senate campaign in Illinois, in 1858, he had insisted that blacks should enjoy the same natural rights as whites (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness), but he opposed granting them legal equality or the right to vote.By the end of his life, Lincoln’s outlook had changed dramatically. In his last public address, delivered in April 1865, he said that in reconstructing Louisiana, and by implication other Southern states, he would “prefer” that limited black suffrage be implemented. He singled out the “very intelligent” (educated free blacks) and “those who serve our cause as soldiers” as most worthy. Though hardly an unambiguous embrace of equality, this was the first time an American president had endorsed any political rights for blacks.And then there was his magnificent second inaugural address of March 4, 1865, in which Lincoln ruminated on the deep meaning of the war. He now identified the institution of slavery — not the presence of blacks, as in 1862 — as its fundamental cause. The war, he said, might well be a divine punishment for the evil of slavery. And God might will it to continue until all the wealth the slaves had created had been destroyed, and “until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword.” Lincoln was reminding Americans that violence did not begin with the firing on Fort Sumter, S.C., in April 1861. What he called “this terrible war” had been preceded by 250 years of the terrible violence of slavery.In essence, Lincoln asked the nation to confront unblinkingly the legacy of slavery. What were the requirements of justice in the face of this reality? What would be necessary to enable former slaves and their descendants to enjoy fully the pursuit of happiness? Lincoln did not live to provide an answer. A century and a half later, we have yet to do so."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/us/chief-justice-roberts-prods-congress-on-fiscal-matters.html,"WASHINGTON — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. used his year-end report on the federal judiciary to give Congressional budget negotiators a little nudge.“Our country faces new challenges, including the much-publicized ‘fiscal cliff’ and the longer-term problem of a truly extravagant and burgeoning national debt,” he wrote. “No one seriously doubts that the country’s fiscal ledger has gone awry. The public properly looks to its elected officials to craft a solution.”The chief justice said that his branch of the government provided an example of doing much with few resources. The federal judiciary makes do with a budget appropriation of about $7 billion, he wrote, “a mere two-tenths of 1 percent of the United States’ total budget of $3.7 trillion.”“Yes,” he went on, “for each citizen’s tax dollar, only two-tenths of one penny goes toward funding the entire third branch of government!”In the report, Chief Justice Roberts said the judiciary was doing what it could to cut costs in rent, salaries and computer services. The Supreme Court “continues to set a good example,” he said, asking for a smaller appropriation in the last fiscal year than in the previous one. This fiscal year, the request rose slightly, “largely in response to new judicial security needs,” he said. He did not elaborate.An appendix to the chief justice’s report on the workload of the federal courts showed decreases in the Supreme Court’s docket and in the number of cases it is deciding. In the term that ended last year, the number of requests for Supreme Court review dropped by almost two percent from the previous term. The justices issued just 64 signed opinions in the most recent term, down from 75.The federal courts went to great lengths last year in trying circumstances, notably after Hurricane Sandy. “As just one example,” he said, “the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York conducted emergency hearings in Lower Manhattan the day after the storm hit, working in a building without heat or hot water that was only sparsely lit by gas-fueled emergency generators.” Though Chief Justice Roberts did not say so, the Supreme Court also showed fortitude the day the storm hit, hearing arguments when the rest of official Washington was closed.He called on President Obama and Congress “to be especially attentive to the needs of the judicial branch and provide the resources necessary to its operation.”“Because the judiciary has already pursued cost containment so aggressively, it will become increasingly difficult to economize further without reducing the quality of judicial services,” he wrote. “Virtually all of the judiciary’s core functions are constitutionally and statutorily required. Unlike executive branch agencies, the courts do not have discretionary programs they can eliminate or projects they can postpone.”The number of judicial vacancies does not help matters, he went on. “At the close of 2012, 27 of the existing judicial vacancies are designated as presenting judicial emergencies,” he wrote. “I urge the executive and legislative branches to act diligently in nominating and confirming highly qualified candidates to fill those vacancies.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/nyregion/changing-tone-on-disaster-relief-costs-when-its-closer-to-home.html,"Glint-eyed and with a practiced amiability, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Harold Rogers, would have us know that his heart is heavy at our suffering, even as he applies a little Kentucky common sense to New York and New Jersey.Just because the United States Senate approved a $60.4 billion package for the hurricane-ravaged lands of New York and New Jersey last week, don’t expect the Kentucky congressman to move so fast.“That’s the Senate; they do their thing,” Mr. Rogers, a Republican, told reporters recently. “We are scrubbing the numbers, looking at the justifications, being sure we are dealing with the results of the hurricane and not other causes.”I set out in search of other causes on Monday, driving down Father Capodanno Boulevard on Staten Island. I saw houses spun like tops off foundations and strips of siding ripped off once-handsome homes. I saw ruined Barbie dolls and Legos swept in eddies, mountains of debris and the broken skeleton of the vintage 1940s Victory Diner.I knocked at the door of Santo Lisa’s home, which faces the white-flecked Atlantic Ocean. A retired firefighter with the loose-limbed walk of a man accustomed to running toward danger, Mr. Lisa is the sort whom politicians love to pose with after disasters. The same is true of his next-door neighbor, a young firefighter, except that he’s not there now. His home, smashed and leaning sideways, has an “Unsafe — Do Not Enter or Occupy” notice taped to its front door.When Hurricane Sandy howled, Mr. Lisa heard an old woman screaming for help. He ran downstairs to get a thick rope; he planned to wade into ocean waters and run fast as rapids to rescue her. His basement already bubbled with water. He listened until her screams stopped. They found her body later in the marsh behind her home.“New York is getting $60 billion? When? Where?” Mr. Lisa said. “Show it to me. We’ll be O.K., but this was a great neighborhood of cops, firemen and sanitation men. A lot of us are hurting here.”There are few sights less edifying than self-satisfied men giving themselves a fiscal conservative rubdown as a stretch of America lies ruined. United States Senator Dan Coats of Indiana assured the Northeast last week that he cared deeply, even as he tried to surgically remove more than half the hurricane relief package.“An emergency funding bill should focus on the emergency needs of the victims, not the needs of politicians,” he noted primly, adding that loading up an expensive package “with unrelated projects and earmarks for other states is not the way we should use taxpayer dollars.”No doubt the keen-eyed could discover lard in the rescue package. Our politicians are as expert as those of Indiana, South Carolina and Mississippi in mining a budget for riches.The cost of disaster aid has crept up, fueled by the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and Hurricane Katrina, to the point that the Federal Reserve recently found that most cities, whatever their bitter losses, no longer suffer any long-term economic declines from natural disasters.That might be seen as cause for celebration. Or not. Senator Coats has many complaints. Only $9 billion of the Senate rescue package, he says, would be spent in the next nine months. And it should not include money for the Legal Services Corporation.THIS last is a tip-off as to the game afoot, as the Legal Services Corporation long ago achieved Hezbollah status in the Republican cosmology. I nosed around and found that after tornadoes and all manner of disasters in Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky, Legal Services lawyers helped broken families and businesses file insurance, FEMA and unemployment claims.Tug still harder on the yarn ball of these arguments and the filaments come apart. Some money will not be spent quickly? Guilty as charged: It takes many months to fortify boilers and elevators in public housing, to replace subway electrical systems and rebuild nursing homes and beaches.House and Senate Republican leaders seem particularly distressed when our politicians talk of safeguarding our region against the next globally warmed torrent of ocean water. This carries the unwelcome scent of free spending.Representative Rogers is a more practical man when playing locally. After floodwaters ripped through Kentucky in 2010, he announced that he had snared $2 million in federal dollars so various rural hamlets could put up flood walls and diversionary canals.Years ago, as a reporter, I sat in post-Katrina Gulfport, Miss., and listened as Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, crowed of raking in federal aid. I might have felt more enthusiastic had I not just heard his people boast that federal cash would change the “Redneck Riviera” into a more upscale locale.Whatever. In my city, in my region, the musty whiff of disaster hangs heavy, and our politicians talk of keeping neighborhoods whole. That commitment, to quickly rebuilding neighborhoods within reason, offers a good definition of the commonweal."

It may be the most discernible effect of the volatility of the last two months.In that time, Israelis were confronted with an eight-day conflict with Gaza; the Palestinians’ status upgrade at the United Nations; international condemnation of Israel’s settlement push in East Jerusalem; and an election campaign in which candidates seem to be trying to out-conservative one another.All of the political activity has certainly increased conversation about “the situation,” local shorthand for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. But if the intense fighting with Gaza heightened concerns about safety, its aftermath seems only to have renewed many residents’ resignation to what they see as the unlikeliness of a long-term solution in their lifetimes.In conversations with 30 people — most around a downtown park or inside the popular Ikea cafe — many said their focus had quickly returned to more mundane concerns about jobs, children and apartment rents. Some talked of leaving the troubled country or worried that their children might — in line with a recent poll for the newspaper Haaretz indicating that 37 percent of Israelis were considering doing so. And in the interviews here, at least half said they did not see anyone worth voting for on Jan. 22.“People are looking after their personal factors — they’re so skeptical about the global changing, they say ‘Oh, I’ll worry about my survival,’ ” explained Ayal Sheffer, 43, a publishing executive with three young daughters who was having lunch at Ikea after shopping for a bed.“I just want quiet for my children and my country,” he said. But as for the Palestinians, he added, “I don’t think any contract we’d do with them would give us quiet.”“We want to pay the price, but we don’t believe in the other side,” Mr. Sheffer said.Rishon LeZion, about seven miles south of Tel Aviv, was founded in 1882 by European Jews. Its middle-class population has doubled over the past two decades, including a large community of Ethiopians and an even larger contingent of immigrants from the former Soviet Union. There is a wide beachfront path filled with walkers and joggers at sunrise, a skyline of tall apartment blocks and cranes building new ones.The first blue-and-white flag with a Star of David was raised here in 1885, according to city officials, and in 1887 a local resident, Shmuel Cohen, combined the poem “Hatikvah” with a European melody — which later became Israel’s national anthem. In the last national elections, in 2009, Rishon voted in slightly higher numbers than Israel as a whole for the two leading parties, Likud and Kadima, as well as for the Russian-dominated Yisrael Beiteinu, but gave less support to the ultra-Orthodox Shas and far-left Meretz parties.Mayor Dov Zur, 57, said that as a child growing up here, he “was quite a believer in the peace process,” but “then, like most Israelis, I abandoned this belief.” His former confidence returned after meetings between Israeli mayors and their Palestinian counterparts in the West Bank.“People are living on both sides of the border, they want good life on both sides,” he said. “The position of mayor, never mind if it’s in Israel or Palestine, it’s a make-decision work. What we find in this discussion is to be practical about the solution to our problem.”In many ways, the interviews here reflect several recent statewide surveys. A December poll by Da’at showed that 12 percent to 14 percent named peace as their highest priority, a drop from 17 percent in January 2012, 19 percent in 2008 and in 1998, and 24 percent in 1992. A separate poll on behalf of the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs found that 83 percent of Israeli Jews do not believe that a withdrawal to the 1967 borders and a division of Jerusalem would bring an end to the conflict. And a poll for the pro-peace group Blue-White Future, a group that supports Israel’s taking unilateral steps to force a two-state solution, found that support for a two-state solution was higher among older respondents.“It’s sometimes worse, sometimes better,” Sofia Turgelan, 34, said of the conflict she has known all her life. “Now it’s quiet, but maybe in six months or one year, it all comes out again.”Ms. Turgelan and her husband were at a downtown playground with their 4-year-old son and 5-year-old daughter. He works in construction; she is unemployed after battling breast cancer. They rent a three-bedroom house for about $1,300 a month because they cannot afford to buy. Recently, she applied for a resident visa, or green card, in the United States.“If I have a chance to leave this country, I would,” she said. “Everything here is busy, busy, busy. Everyone has to work a lot of hours to live a normal life.” Looking at the children, she added, “I don’t think they have the relaxation to study, to enjoy.”Nearby, dozens of older Moroccan and Russian men were playing chess, backgammon and cards for cash on wooden tables near where two Israelis were killed and 50 wounded in a suicide-bomb attack in 2002. George Aizenberg, 62, a doctor from Belarus who came in 2001, said he did not worry about security but was concerned “that our country seems to be slowly losing support from countries where we used to have it.”“If we stay a democratic country, then in several decades there will be an Arab majority and then we may turn into an apartheid state — that worries us,” Dr. Aizenberg said. “We’re not afraid. The military situation doesn’t worry us — we’re willing to sacrifice our children to go to the army — but the democratic process, that could destroy the country.”Shulamit Hafif, 62, said that when the oldest of her four children was born 44 years ago, she imagined that by the time he turned 18, “there won’t be wars.” Now, she is watching her 11 grandchildren inch toward army age.“There’s no way to trust them,” Ms. Hafif said of the Palestinians. “They need to be there, and we need to be here. That’s it.”She added, “They were able to lob missiles at us, and the whole country was in a dilemma.”The long-range rocket that hit Rishon in November landed at 6 p.m. on a Tuesday, destroying the top two floors of a seven-story building. Most residents sat it out in safe rooms, but two were lightly injured.“Shrapnel from stones hit me in the shoulder and hip, and I had large bruises,” recalled Kfir Rozen, 26, who lived on the second floor and was standing on the balcony with his brother despite the warning bell. “We were very scared at first — this is not something you experience every day.”But weeks later, Mr. Rozen’s only complaint was that Israel had agreed to a cease-fire the next night rather than pushing forward with a ground invasion, something echoed in other interviews around town. “You can’t get to a certain point and then go back — you end up achieving nothing,” Mr. Rozen said. “In the end, we will be dragged into another cycle. At some point, this will repeat itself.”Mr. Rozen, who works for the city, said 26 families that were evacuated after the bombing spent about three weeks in a hotel in neighboring Bat Yam, paid for by the state, which is also picking up the tab for their destroyed belongings and apartment repairs. He said his family had found another apartment to rent — in Rishon. “We didn’t see any reason to move anywhere else and feel safe here,” Mr. Rozen said.The new apartment is smaller, four rooms instead of five. No, there is not a safe room. But the building has a communal shelter, Mr. Rozen said, “and our apartment is close to it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/nyregion/for-giuliani-a-chance-to-put-new-stamp-on-city.html,"He has hit the road as a best-selling author, dabbled in presidential politics, tried his hand at overseas security consulting and hopped aboard the corporate speaking circuit.But after a sometimes bruising and unfailingly colorful decade, Rudolph W. Giuliani is turning his relentless personality and blustery style back to the New York City office that catapulted him to national fame.With the man he endorsed to succeed him, Michael R. Bloomberg, about to leave office, Mr. Giuliani is determined to play an outsize role in the race to replace him, quietly putting his political muscle and bulging Rolodex behind a former top City Hall deputy who is seriously considering a mayoral run.Over the last few weeks, Mr. Giuliani and a coterie of former aides have coalesced around the deputy, Joseph J. Lhota, a Bronx-born Republican, with a single-mindedness that borders on fervor, encouraging him to leap into the campaign and talking up his prospects to business and political leaders, at times well beyond the borders of New York. In Ohio, a few days before the presidential election, Mr. Giuliani was overheard extolling Mr. Lhota’s mayoral qualifications backstage at a rally for Mitt Romney.For Mr. Giuliani, 68, a Lhota candidacy represents a coveted chance to reassert his stamp on a city that he transformed in the 1990s, and a way to fend off what he sees at the ultimate threat to his legacy: the election this year of a liberal Democrat who rejects his conservative approach to policing and budgeting.His anxieties echo those concerns that have been widely, but quietly, voiced in the business community with a growing sense of alarm: After an unbroken 20-year stretch of Republican and independent mayors, New York City could slide backward, Mr. Giuliani warns. In the wrong hands, City Hall could fall under the sway of public unions. Spending could spiral. The Police Department could retreat. Crime could surge.New York, he seems to be saying, might return to pre-Rudy days. “It was the same concern of mine in 2001, before Sept. 11,” he said in an interview. “Because I felt like after eight years of the reforms we had, particularly the fiscal reforms, if the city went back into the hands of the usual Democratic politicians, it would be run in the usual Democratic political way.”Enter Mr. Lhota, 58, until Monday chairman of the sprawling Metropolitan Transportation Authority, who is a potential Bloomberg for the post-Bloomberg era, or so the Giuliani-inspired thinking goes. (A sign above Mr. Lhota’s desk at the transportation authority read “Bring Back Common Sense.”)A distinguished investment banker in 1980s, when he specialized in public finance, and a top executive at Cablevision in the early 2000s, when he ran a telecommunications subsidiary, Mr. Lhota is a favorite of the city’s influential corporate crowd.In a sign of how deeply he is weighing a mayoral run, Mr. Lhota resigned his transportation authority post to clear a path for a campaign.Unlike Mr. Bloomberg, who had never worked in government until his election, Mr. Lhota spent eight years in the highest ranks of the Giuliani administration — often filling in as acting mayor when Mr. Giuliani was away or ill — a credential that might, in the unforgiving churn of a mayor’s race, become as much of a liability as an asset.Should he enter the race, Mr. Lhota will most likely be linked with equal vigor to Mr. Giuliani’s hard-fought progress and his operatic excesses, to a time when indisputable improvements to quality of life were achieved through profoundly polarizing means. Crime plunged during Mr. Giuliani’s administration, but racial divisions deepened, and before Sept. 11, even some of his supporters had soured on his brash style. After Sept. 11, he tested his soaring popularity with an ill-fated proposal to remain mayor beyond the end of his term.Mr. Giuliani, never known for shying from a fight, seems to relish a debate over his tenure as well as his return to New York politics. Mr. Lhota, he said, “is the right person at the right time,” just as he believed he was in 1993 and Mr. Bloomberg was in 2001.Within a Giuliani cabinet known for its tightly wound and fiercely loyal figures, Mr. Lhota frequently stood apart: he was a number-crunching pragmatist with a knack for quiet diplomacy. As budget director, and then as deputy mayor, he brokered deals averting ugly showdowns over Mr. Giuliani’s stands on the placement of homeless shelters and steep cuts to spending on the arts. “In Giuliani world, he was one of the adults,” said Fernando Ferrer, who clashed with the administration as Bronx borough president and later ran for mayor against Mr. Bloomberg.But Mr. Lhota was also a protagonist in several of the Giuliani administration’s most pugilistic adventures. After a series of disagreements in the late 1990s with the Citizens Budget Commission, an independent fiscal watchdog, Mr. Lhota called major securities firms that underwrote city bonds, discouraging them from attending the commission’s annual fund-raising dinner. Given Mr. Lhota’s role in selecting which investment firms received city business, the calls touched off a furor.“There was an implied threat,” recalled Ray Horton, the budget commission’s then president, who believes Mr. Lhota was carrying out the mayor’s wishes. Mr. Lhota, he said, “did not exercise very good judgment” at the time.Mr. Giuliani and Mr. Lhota remain close, their bond solidified by years of reciting lines from “The Godfather,” a weakness for Winston Churchill and occasional dinners to catch up.Mr. Lhota declined to comment for this article.But Mr. Giuliani played down the political risk of Mr. Lhota’s links to his administration, arguing that Mr. Lhota’s record — and that of his administration — spoke louder than any theatrical tactics.“Almost all of these cases had happy endings,” Mr. Giuliani said. “But they always started with a very dramatic uncompromising position. Part of it was the time. We had to change the city. We had to change 30 years of the city and how it operated.”As Mr. Lhota weighs a run, former aides to Mr. Giuliani have constructed a kind of campaign in waiting for him. Jake Menges, a former City Hall staff member, has tried to line up support from the city’s five Republican Party chairmen for him. Anthony V. Carbonetti, Mr. Giuliani’s former chief of staff, has spoken to potential Lhota donors, sounding some of them out during the Republican National Convention in Tampa, Fla.Mr. Giuliani said that, if he received Mr. Lhota’s blessing, he would become a highly visible presence on the campaign trail for his former deputy, who he believes understands the city’s finances and budgeting “better than anyone else running or who could conceivably run for mayor.”Indeed, Mr. Giuliani sounded sorely disappointed as he assessed the rest of the likely 2013 mayoral candidates, describing them as likable but unqualified. Christine C. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council “had to vote on the budget; she didn’t really do the budget.” About former Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr., who ran the Board of Education during Mr. Giuliani’s mayoralty, he said this: “He really didn’t do that budget. We did it.”Mr. Giuliani could soon find himself at odds with Mr. Bloomberg, who aides say admired Mr. Lhota’s record at the transportation authority but who is still expected to support Ms. Quinn in the mayor’s race.Mr. Giuliani’s biggest worry: that as mayor, one of these Democratic candidates would agree to overly generous contracts with public worker unions, almost all of which have stopped negotiating with Mr. Bloomberg in the hopes of reaching more favorable deals with his successor.“New York has a crisis; it has a fiscal crisis,” Mr. Giuliani said without citing specific data.For many New Yorkers who arrived after the Giuliani era, and even those who lived through it, his dark vision may prove a tough sell.“Rudy won in ’93 with a city that was on its heels — it was palpable. You felt it every day,” said Fred Siegel, a scholar in residence at St. Francis College in Brooklyn who served on Mr. Giuliani’s transition committee in 1993.“The city is not on its heels right now,” he said. “There is none of that now. Try to tell hipster Brooklyn that the city is in trouble.”Mr. Giuliani does not dispute this. The city forgets, he said.Mr. Lhota “runs at a different time,” he said. “It will be hard for people to remember how bad it was.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/us/politics/grand-bargains-give-way-to-legislative-quick-fixes.html,"WASHINGTON — The confusing struggle to head off a national fiscal crisis has made one thing crystal clear: The era of the Big Deal is over.Despite repeated, intense and personal efforts by President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner as well as bipartisan coalitions, gangs of senators, supercommittees, special commissions and wonky outsiders, the grand bargain remains the elusive holy grail of fiscal policy and seems destined to stay that way for now.“We don’t seem to be able to do grand bargains very well,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has long been a force for compromise.Some groups have produced the framework for smaller deals and even gained some bipartisan support, particularly the 2010 Simpson-Bowles plan, which fell just short of a 14-vote threshold required to get before Congress. But the alchemy of Mr. Obama and the current Republican-controlled House, not to mention the ideologically diverse Senate, appears hopelessly inhospitable to accomplishing something huge.As Mr. Obama all but acknowledged Monday, big bipartisan legislative dreams seem all but certain to be miniaturized as incremental policy visions.“My preference would have been to solve all these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain, whatever you want to call it,” he said. “Maybe we can do it in stages. We’re going to solve this problem instead in several steps.”Republicans appear to agree. “We’ll continue to work on smart ways to cut spending,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on the Senate floor. “But let’s not let that stand in the way.”The list of unrealized goals from Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner’s last attempt at a grand bargain two weeks ago are breathtaking in their number, particularly when compared with the probable outcome of these final Congressional negotiations. Ambitious plans to overhaul the individual tax code, tackle corporate rates, revamp the Medicare program and possibly consider changes in Social Security appear to have given way mainly to a tax increase for big earners.Members in both the House and the Senate said perhaps that was O.K.“We can’t do the task all at once,” said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. “I pushed for a big deal, but in this case this time we can only get the tax piece done, so we need to move we need to get it done.”The downside of incrementalism is apparent every month in Washington, as a new battle emerges and legislative Band-Aids are affixed to fiscal gunshot wounds.While Congress appeared on Monday to be lurching to a deal to avoid significant tax increases for millions of Americans, the emerging patchwork tax deal would push a series of fights into the next Congress, most of them very likely to be marked by the same 11th-hour, rancorous dynamics that have been the signature of every other fiscal deal.Most pressing, Congress will have to come together as early as next month to lift the debt ceiling, which Republicans are already hoping to leverage to eke more spending cuts from Democrats. A similar fight almost led to default in 2011, and damaged the nation’s credit rating.In March, Congress will spar again over a short-term spending agreement to keep the government open, the same sort that led to a near shutdown almost two years ago. It appeared on Monday that scheduled spending cuts to the Pentagon and other parts of government — the result of last year’s debt ceiling agreement — will be delayed for two months, yet another short-term kick of the can. Republicans and Democrats will most likely revisit the recurring question of revenues versus spending cuts when those two months are up.Because the sharply divided 112th Congress and the White House repeatedly eschewed large-scale deals in favor of quick fixes, myriad bills left undone will be in the hands of the 113th Congress, set to convene at noon Thursday.The legislation includes a farm bill to replace the one that has expired, a lapse that may result in soaring milk prices; a transportation bill; a funding mechanism to supplement the waning gas tax reserves to meet infrastructure needs; and even a measure, once completely uncontroversial, to prevent domestic violence.Also left to the new year is a bill to help states hit by Hurricane Sandy. The Senate passed such a measure last week, but House Republicans, as has been the case with every disaster relief bill in this Congress, disagree with Democrats on its level of spending, and a final deal seems unlikely until the next Congress. The House was also set to vote on Tuesday on a quickie measure to deal with dairy prices.Doing business in pieces may end up a productive formula — in the sense that walking 100 miles will still transport a person absent an airplane or a bus — but many outside Congress do not think such halting forward motion should be confused with actual success.“That’s the nature of the dysfunction,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. “For the parties, it gives them temporary cover and to fight again on the issues in the next few months. The parties please their base, but the country does not get a solution.”But that seems to be the nature of what constitutes progress in such a sharply divided political world."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/middleeast/victory-over-iraq-in-1991-was-swift-but-flawed.html,"WASHINGTON — As the 1991 Persian Gulf war drew to a close, Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf told an anxious nation that an American-led juggernaut had swept across the desert, stunned its foe and evicted Saddam Hussein’s forces from Kuwait.“We’ve accomplished our mission,” the commander declared in a presentation deemed such a tour de force that it was known as “the mother of all briefings.”“The gate is closed,” he added confidently, on Iraq’s “war machine.”Now, General Schwarzkopf’s death, and the hospitalization of former President George Bush, 88, have returned the spotlight to the war they prosecuted together, which some of its architects have cast as a model for a successful intervention abroad.The gulf war appeared to have it all: a foreign tyrant who committed an indisputable act of aggression, a president who rallied the international community to roll back the occupation of a defenseless oil-rich nation, and an American military eager to prove itself in its most demanding test since Vietnam.For some former officials it was, plain and simple, the “good war” — a war that set limited objectives against an invader, was waged in a mere six weeks and was then punctuated by victory parades. The battles yet to come, more open-ended conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan, proved to be far more costly in lives and treasure.And yet the Persian Gulf war occupies a more complex place in military history than the hagiography suggests. The generalship was not without its faults, and the White House decision to bring the conflict to a close before all of Mr. Hussein’s Republican Guard divisions were destroyed has remained a subject of debate, even among ranking officers who were on the battlefield.The 1991 gulf conflict may have been a “war of necessity,” as its supporters say, and the 2003 invasion of Iraq a “war of choice.” But it was the outcome of the first gulf war, which left Mr. Hussein in power and forced the United States to carry out more than a decade of air patrols over northern and southern Iraq, that presented the United States with that choice.The act that precipitated the gulf conflict was Mr. Hussein’s August 1990 invasion of Kuwait, an attack that caught the White House flat-footed despite intelligence warning of the Iraqis’ military preparations.The first task was the defense of Saudi Arabia, which General Schwarzkopf’s command took on from a position of considerable disadvantage. His Central Command, based in Tampa, Fla., had no forces to speak of in the region, or even a regional headquarters.As the months went by, the planning shifted to offense as Mr. Bush and his team set their sights on evicting Iraqi forces from Kuwait.Mr. Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker III secured the backing of the United Nations Security Council and garnered broad international support. Britain, France, Saudi Arabia, Egypt and even Syria were part of the fighting coalition.Maintaining support at home was more challenging. The Senate resolution authorizing the use of force was adopted by a narrow vote of 52 to 47. (Senators Al Gore of Tennessee, Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and Harry Reid of Nevada were among the Democrats who voted for the measure, but Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts and Joseph R. Biden Jr. of Delaware voted “no,” as did Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia.)Iraq had a formidable arsenal of chemical weapons. Yielding to American warnings, the Iraqis did not employ poison gas. But nobody on the American side could be sure it would not be used.Guided by Gen. Colin L. Powell, who was the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the United States assembled an overwhelming force. The four-day ground war was preceded by more than five weeks of bombardment.When the shooting ended, it was clear that the all-volunteer military had been a success. Stealth aircraft and precision weapons had proved themselves on the battlefield. Though the United States deployed about 540,000 personnel, 148 were killed in action or died of their wounds, according to the Defense Department.Importantly, the ghosts of Vietnam had been exorcised. For the first time since that bloody war in Southeast Asia, the United States armed forces demonstrated that they could win a major land war in a foreign land.Still, the gulf war was not as decisive as some of its proponents had hoped.Trying to secure their hold on Kuwait, Iraqi commanders had erected a defense in depth. The most expendable Iraqi forces were arrayed in southern Kuwait behind mine belts, sand berms and oil-filled ditches that were set aflame.Iraq’s armored and mechanized forces were arrayed in the interior of Kuwait, along with considerable artillery. Behind them were Republican Guard divisions, the best-equipped and most loyal units in Mr. Hussein’s army.Iraq’s plan was to bloody the American forces as they pushed north into Kuwait so that the Republican Guard troops could deliver decisive blows.General Schwarzkopf sought to turn the Iraqi strategy on its head. The plan was for the Marines, fortified by an American armored brigade, to attack into Kuwait and draw the attention of Iraqi commanders. A Marine amphibious force afloat would also be used as a feint to tie down Iraqi troops.  Then the Army’s VII Corps, which was deployed to the west of the Marines in Saudi Arabia and reinforced by a British division, would outflank the Republican Guard forces. The Army’s XVIII Airborne Corps, which was deployed in the far western desert in Saudi Arabia and reinforced by the French, would also participate in the envelopment, which became known as “the left hook.”The goal was not merely to expel Iraqi troops from Kuwait but also to destroy the Republican Guard units in order to deprive Iraq of the ability to menace Kuwait and other gulf states in the future.But the American strategy did not entirely work as planned. Instead of being lured into a kill zone, many of the Republican Guard troops began to flee. General Schwarzkopf found it difficult to accelerate the main Army attack, and the war tuned into a race.The Army’s 24th Mechanized Infantry Division and 101st Airborne Division were beginning to catch up and hoped to bottle up the fleeing Republican Guard forces near Basra, in southern Iraq.At a 2011 conference at Texas A&M University, Walter E. Boomer, the retired general who led the Marine attack into Kuwait, recalled that he had told General Schwarzkopf over the radio that his Marines were also prepared to pursue the fleeing Iraqi forces.“I said, ‘We’re poised to launch for Basra, and we will police up the rest of these folks if you want us to,’ ” General Boomer said. “He said, ‘Stand by.’ And then the next message that I received was not directly from him but through my headquarters that we had in fact stopped.”With American warplanes attacking Iraqi columns fleeing Kuwait City, Mr. Bush was eager to avoid the charge of piling on. He decided to end the ground war at 100 hours, with the strong encouragement of General Powell.General Schwarzkopf supported the decision, though it later emerged that amid the confusion on the battlefield not even he knew the precise location of some of the attacking American units.“On balance, we had accomplished the mission,” General Powell said at the conference. “The Iraqi Army was fleeing. And it is easy to say, ‘Well, you should have just kept killing.’ But this is an army that we did not want to totally destroy.”But General Boomer offered a different perspective in a 2011 interview with a North Carolina radio station. “I continue to be asked if we stopped too soon,” he said. “The answer in retrospect is ‘yes.’ ”According to American intelligence, half of the Republican Guard tanks escaped as of March 1, 1991. Significantly, headquarters units also survived, and this helped Iraqi generals reconstitute their forces and put down the Shiite uprising that began in the south afterward.At cease-fire talks that were held in Safwan, Iraq, General Schwarzkopf agreed to an Iraqi request that the Iraqi military be allowed to fly helicopters in southern Iraq because so many bridges had been destroyed. But the Iraqi military abused this concession by using the helicopters to attack the Shiite insurgents. The United States, along with its British and French allies, did not establish a no-fly zone in southern Iraq until August 1992.Ousting Mr. Hussein would have gone beyond the formal mandate for the military campaign, and Mr. Bush and his aides were determined not to march on Baghdad and take on the burden of occupation, a decision supported by Dick Cheney, who was Mr. Bush’s secretary of defense. But declassified memorandums from Mr. Bush’s presidential archives made clear that he had hoped the war would facilitate the dictator’s exit.In a discussion with Mr. Bush on Nov. 19, 1991, Prince Bandar bin Sultan, the Saudi ambassador to Washington, delivered a message from King Fahd, the Saudi monarch. “We have a lot to do to finish with Iraq,” Prince Bandar said.“Tell him not to worry,” Mr. Bush replied. “We must do whatever it takes to get rid of the guy. Tell him we are not changing one bit. We are talking about ways of undermining him. There will be no letting up on sanctions or inspections. We are looking into what we can do with broadcasts. We will not go back to the status quo ante.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/technology/tech-giants-learning-the-ways-of-washington-brace-for-more-scrutiny.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation’s capital and overseas.In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans’ video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings.But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking.Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation — meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack — that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry’s main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that the chairman of the commission itself, Jon Leibowitz, will step down.The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration.“Now that the election is over, Silicon Valley companies each are thinking through their strategy for the second Obama administration,” said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official. “The F.T.C. will have a new Democratic chairman. A priority for tech companies will be to discern the new chair’s own priorities.”In early 2012, an unusual burst of lobbying by tech companies helped defeat antipiracy bills, which had been backed by the entertainment industry. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google feared that the bills would force them to police the Internet.At the end of the year, Silicon Valley also got its way when the Obama administration stood up against a proposed global treaty that would have given government authorities greater control over the Web.The key to the industry’s successes in 2012 was simple: it expanded its footprint in Washington just as Washington began to pay closer attention to how technology companies affect consumers. “Privacy and security became top-tier important policy issues in Washington in 2012,” said David A. Hoffman, director of security policy and global privacy officer at Intel.“Industry has realized it is important to be engaged,” he continued, “to make sure government stakeholders are fully informed and educated about the role that new technology plays and to make sure any action taken doesn’t unnecessarily burden the innovation economy while still protecting individual trust in new technology.”At the end of 2012, tech companies were on track to have spent record amounts on lobbying for the year. In the first three quarters, they spent close to $100 million, which meant that they were likely to surpass the $127 million they spent on lobbying in 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that tracks corporate spending. Even the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz hired a lobbyist in Washington: Adrian Fenty, a former mayor of the city.Technology executives and investors also made generous contributions in the 2012 presidential race, luring both President Obama and Mitt Romney to Northern California for fund-raisers and nudging them to speak out on issues like immigration overhaul and lower tax rates.In a blog post in November, the center said Silicon Valley’s lobbying expenditures have ballooned in recent years, even as spending by other industries has fallen.Facebook more than doubled its lobbying outlay in the year, reporting close to $2.6 million through the third quarter of 2012. Google spent more than any other company in the industry, doling out more than $13 million in the same period and more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft, which spent just over $5.6 million in the same period.Among Google’s advocates on Capitol Hill is a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari, who heads Google’s office in Washington.Google has particular reason to be engaged. It faces a wide-reaching antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, just as Microsoft did a decade ago. At issue is whether Google’s search engine results favor Google products over its rivals’.Although the agency was ready to settle that case before the holidays, without harsh remedies, late last month it shelved the inquiry and put stronger penalties back in play. A resolution is expected in January.The commission has already fined Google on a separate matter. In 2012, the company paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser to track users and serve them targeted advertisements.Facebook has vastly expanded its Washington presence in recent years. It has set up a political action committee, hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties and offered tips to lawmakers in an effort to make its site indispensable to politicians seeking re-election.Facebook scored a win on Capitol Hill in late 2012 when it nudged Congress to amend a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, that had protected the privacy of Americans’ video rental records. Facebook and its partner, Netflix, the video streaming service, advocated for changes in the law so that movies watched on Netflix could be shared on Facebook. That kind of data can be valuable for behavioral advertising, a principal source of revenue for Web services like Facebook.The company also attracted increased scrutiny from the F.T.C. The agency negotiated a consent order with Facebook to settle charges that it had engaged in “unfair and deceptive practices” when changes in its settings revealed personal information that Facebook users had regarded to be private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to audits of its privacy policies for 20 years.Facebook faced renewed public outcry last month when its subsidiary, Instagram, proposed to deploy users’ pictures to serve targeted advertisements. The company has backtracked on that proposal, but the outcry, say consumer privacy advocates, is an indication of public sentiment.“Yes, the industry managed to hold off privacy legislation this year,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “But if the end-of-year protests over the Facebook and Instagram changes are any indication, users will be pressing for better privacy protections in the next Congress.”Silicon Valley’s lobbying efforts are also likely to expand across the Atlantic in 2013. Both Facebook and Google have faced off with European regulators over privacy issues. Now, the European Parliament is weighing an overhaul of data protection laws that apply across the Continent.One of the proposed changes requires Web companies to ask European Union citizens for their explicit consent before collecting personal data for targeted Web advertising. Web companies vigorously oppose that and other proposals."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/opinion/my-last-day-in-congress.html,"Roslyn Heights, N.Y.IT’S my last full day as a member of the Congress, and I have it all under control — I think.I’m fulfilled and grateful to have been able to pay back a small portion for the good things that happened to me in life. To retire after 35 years in elected office, with no formulated plan as yet but goofing off with my grandchildren, seems right for the moment. I’m happy to play the rest of life by ear.I had hoped to keep my emotions in check, to put off the question of who I am. Did I become the job? Without it, who will I be? The question tomorrow will be — as Jean Valjean sings in “Les Misérables” — “Who am I?”But my emotions have a mind of their own. This week I cast my last vote — “to extend certain tax relief provisions enacted in 2001 and 2003” and “for other purposes” — of what I estimate have been more than 16,000 votes cast in my career.Coming from an immigrant family of Polish Jews with peasant origins, sheltered by decent, safe public housing (the Kingsborough Houses in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, and the Pomonok Houses in Flushing, Queens), receiving great medical care when I needed it thanks to a generous society (and charity hospitals such as St. Giles the Cripple and St. Luke’s), educated by wonderful public schools, with a priceless, cost-free degree from Queens College, I have lived my entire life knowing that I owed somebody something.And I fancied myself becoming somebody, and paying it forward. I taught in public schools. I helped start a business. (Yes, liberals can be job creators and believe in capitalism.) As a state senator and then a congressman, I’ve had the privilege of trying to do good things for people to whom I owe so much and can never fully repay. I’ve personally demanded that tyrants let their people go. I’ve tried to feed the hungry, clothe the poor, protect the elderly and infirm, and defend the needy from the aggressively greedy. I’ve led a blessed life. What a kick for a kid from the projects.I entered government service at a time when America was becoming more and more diverse. Some neighborhoods in my hometown, New York City, were changing so rapidly, welcoming people with so much hope and talent and pride, one just had to know that so much promise could only make a great nation better.I remember from my childhood a wooden jigsaw puzzle map of what were then the 48 states. The puzzle wasn’t complete unless one could fit all the pieces together to make one country, our country. But the House of Representatives has 435 separate pieces, each piece represented by a person speaking for communities with different ideas and approaches. On many occasions, we made it all fit together. Compromise was not heresy. Your opponent was not your enemy. The debate was choosing between better or worse policies, not good or evil ideologies. Of course, between good and bad there is a void of gray.Two months shy of 30 years in the House, I leave a chamber in which we challenge one another’s legitimacy, not one another’s ideas. When I arrived in Washington, in 1983, Ronald Reagan was president, the Republicans controlled the Senate, and the Democrats were the majority in the House. Today the situation is reversed: Barack Obama is about to be sworn in for a second term, the Democrats control the Senate and the Republicans are in the majority in the House.What has changed is the disappearance of the spirit of cooperation and shared sacrifice that, only three decades ago, could bring political opponents together. I came at a time of great hope and leave at a time when finding a middle path has become a much greater challenge.My last votes capped off a chapter of a storybook life I couldn’t have dreamed up: the fiscal compromise approved by the House, with the support of nearly all Democrats and a minority of Republicans, staved off what would have been devastating tax-rate increases for nearly all but the wealthiest American households. The background music of Claude-Michel Schönberg sounded in my mind.Sadly, there was a disappointing coda, as House leaders failed to bring to a vote legislation to provide emergency aid to those left desperate and dispirited by Hurricane Sandy. (House Republican leaders are now promising a vote on that legislation on Friday, when the new, 113th Congress will have been seated.) I found myself hoping for “one day more.”As I walked out of La Guardia Airport this morning, on my last flight as a congressman from Reagan National Airport, I suddenly felt lost. I got misty. Without a musket to raise, a barricade to storm, a flag to wave, the question hit me in the face like the cold air: “Who am I?”Back home on Long Island, I am slowly regrouping, stunned by my own question. But wait. Slowly, slowly, from the back of my mind ... can you hear it? It’s the sound of distant drums!"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/world/asia/thousands-protest-over-hong-kongs-leader.html,"HONG KONG — Thousands of demonstrators in rival marches crowded through Hong Kong’s main shopping district on Tuesday to praise or condemn the city’s chief executive, who appears to retain the confidence of leaders in Beijing despite facing criticism here over a series of actions.The New Year’s Day marches underlined deep political divisions in Hong Kong, a semiautonomous territory that Britain returned to Chinese rule in 1997.Critics of the chief executive, Leung Chun-ying, accuse him of misleading the public on a controversial real estate issue, and of being a puppet installed by Beijing. Many of his critics also favor greater democracy for Hong Kong, where the chief executive is now chosen by a 1,200-member panel packed with Beijing loyalists; the general public elects half the legislature, while the other half is chosen by business leaders and other groups that also tend to follow Beijing’s wishes.Mr. Leung’s backers, mainly organized by groups with lavish financial support from Beijing, contend that he is beginning to address deep-seated social issues here. They also tend to suggest that democracy is a Western concept that may not be compatible with local culture or with rapid economic development.Supporters of Mr. Leung roughed up two local journalists at a separate rally on Sunday; many Beijing loyalists accuse Hong Kong journalists of being biased in favor of democracy.But the events on Tuesday were largely peaceful. Organizers of two follow-up rallies in favor of Mr. Leung gave crowd estimates totaling 62,500, while a police spokeswoman put the figure at 8,560. Demonstrators seeking Mr. Leung’s resignation were more numerous, with rival groups of organizers providing estimates for a march and a separate rally totaling 142,000 people, while police estimates totaled 28,500.The police announced on Wednesday morning than nine protesters against Mr. Leung had been arrested for disorderly conduct and unlawful assembly the previous night after they tried to cross police lines to protest at the front gate of Mr. Leung’s official residence. Mr. Leung, who took office as chief executive on July 1, has faced heavy criticism for concealing during last winter’s election campaign that he had secretly expanded his $64 million home without receiving government planning permission or paying real estate fees due on the expansion.Mr. Leung has been widely accused of hypocrisy because he won the election partly by criticizing his opponent, Henry Tang, for the unauthorized construction of a huge basement under a villa owned by Mr. Tang’s wife. That construction was also done without government planning permission, which is difficult to obtain, and without making a large payment to the government, which owns virtually all the land in Hong Kong and collects hefty lease payments based mainly on the square footage of developments.Mr. Leung apologized this autumn for concealing his construction — he even built a false wall to hide his extension right before running for the territory’s top office. But he pointed out that he had not addressed his own compliance with Hong Kong real estate laws during the campaign.“In fact, in my memory, I did not say I had no illegal structure,” he told the legislature.Many Hong Kong residents blame growing immigration and tourism from mainland China for driving housing prices to unaffordable levels, for causing overcrowding in local schools and for making it harder for young people to find jobs. Mr. Leung has addressed these issues in his first six months in office by imposing steep taxes this autumn on short-term real estate investments by anyone who is not a permanent resident. He has also banned local hospitals, starting on New Year’s Day, from scheduling any more births for mainland mothers.Continued support for Mr. Leung from Beijing makes it likely that he will remain in office. When the legislature took up a no-confidence measure three weeks ago, a majority of the lawmakers elected by the general public voted against Mr. Leung, but a majority of lawmakers representing business leaders and other social groups supported him. To pass, a majority of both groups was required.In separate meetings with Mr. Leung nearly two weeks ago in Beijing, President Hu Jintao of China and Xi Jinping, who became the general secretary of the ruling Communist Party in November and is slated to become China’s next president in March, each said separately that they support Mr. Leung and his administration.“You have a heavy workload and it is exhausting,” Mr. Xi said. “The central government affirms your work.”Sprinkled among the protesters against Mr. Leung were a few people carrying the colonial Hong Kong flag that flew over the city during British rule. Beijing officials have asked Hong Kong residents not to display the flag, which they regard as a symbol of past foreign domination and humiliation of China.Steveny Chan, a young woman who identified herself only as an office worker and carried a roughly 3-foot-by-2-foot colonial flag, said that she did not favor the return of Hong Kong to British rule. She said that she was displaying the flag as a nostalgic symbol of a time when the Hong Kong economy seemed to offer more opportunities for young people, and when Britain, before the return to China, was granting the people of Hong Kong growing autonomy.“We’re missing the golden old days of Hong Kong,” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/a-new-breed-of-republicans-resists-the-fiscal-deal.html,"WASHINGTON — Just a few years ago, the tax deal pushed through Congress on Tuesday would have been a Republican fiscal fantasy, a sweeping bill that locks in virtually all of the Bush-era tax cuts, exempts almost all estates from taxation, and enshrines the former president’s credo that dividends and capital gains should be taxed equally and gently.But times have changed, President George W. Bush is gone, and before the bill’s final passage late Tuesday, House Republican leaders struggled all day to quell a revolt among caucus members who threatened to blow up a hard-fought compromise that they could have easily framed as a victory. Many House Republicans seemed determined to put themselves in a position to be blamed for sending the nation’s economy into a potential tailspin under the weight of automatic tax increases and spending cuts.The latest internal party struggle on Capitol Hill surprised even Senate Republicans, who had voted overwhelmingly for a deal largely hashed out by their leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The bill passed the Senate, 89 to 8, at 2 a.m. on Tuesday, with only 5 of the chamber’s 47 Republicans voting no.Twenty-one hours later, the same measure was opposed by 151 of the 236 Republicans voting in the House. It was further proof that House Republicans are a new breed, less enamored of tax cuts per se than they are driven to shrink government through steep spending cuts. Protecting nearly 99 percent of the nation’s households from an income tax increase was not enough if taxes rose on some and government spending was untouched.A party that once disputed that there was any real “cost” of tax cuts encountered sticker shock when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting them in place of the “fiscal cliff” provisions would cost $4 trillion over 10 years.“I personally hate it,” Representative John Campbell, a Republican from California, said of the bill. “The speaker the day after the election said we would give on taxes, and we have, but we wanted spending cuts. This bill has spending increases. Are you kidding me?”By all accounts, the tax deal negotiated by Mr. McConnell and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is one of the most sweeping fiscal policy changes in a decade, a measure that would bring a certainty to the tax code long demanded by the financial community and taxpayers.The bill’s heft was confirmed on Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office, which said the income and business tax cut extensions; new capital gains, dividend and estate tax rates; and unemployment compensation would add an estimated $4 trillion to the federal deficit compared with where the government would be if Congress did nothing to halt the tax increases and spending cuts that were triggered at the start of the year.The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that measured against extending all 2012 policies, the deal would cut the deficit by $650 billion over 10 years. The group said the biggest cost, a “patch” to the alternative minimum tax to prevent it from suddenly affecting much of the middle class, should not be considered a cost at all because Congress has adjusted it each year anyway.But the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate gave even some Democrats pause, especially since the bill would make permanent virtually all of the Bush tax cuts — a goal that Mr. Bush chased through the rest of his presidency. “For four years in my town hall meetings across the state, Coloradans have told me they want a plan that materially reduces the deficit,” said Senator Michael Bennet, one of three Democrats who voted against the bill. “This proposal does not meet that standard and does not put in place a real process to reduce the debt down the road.”The bill would do much more than head off the automatic tax increases and spending cuts. It would fix in place a tax code that for more than a decade has caused struggles over regular sunset provisions, temporary solutions and fleeting incentives. The bill would finally make permanent five of the six income tax rates created in 2001 by the first Bush tax cut. It would codify Mr. Bush’s successful push, in 2003, to make tax rates on dividends and capital gains equal so that one form of investment income is not favored over the other.But it would let lapse a two-percentage-point cut in the payroll tax, one of the recent tax policy changes most squarely aimed at the working class, meaning take-home pay may be less even if higher income taxes are headed off. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, estimated that 77 percent of Americans could pay more over all to the federal government this year.“For me, this is very much an ‘on the one hand, on the other hand’ thing,” said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary in the years of Mr. Bush’s tax fights. “As a Bush loyalist, it’s fantastic that the Bush tax cuts, which now have to be seen inarguably as overwhelmingly for the middle class, are being made permanent. On the other hand, it’s inarguable that this adds $4 trillion to the federal debt.”The 10-year price includes $762 billion to lock in the Bush tax rates of 10 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent, along with some of the Bush-era 35 percent bracket; $354 billion to continue Mr. Bush’s expanded child credit; and $339 billion to secure Mr. Bush’s 15 percent capital gains and dividend rates for families earning less than $450,000. Fixing the alternative minimum tax would cost the Treasury $1.8 trillion, according to the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.Democrats say they had little choice. The Bush White House and Republican Congresses structured the tax cuts so that letting them expire would be politically difficult. Add the across-the-board spending cuts if Congress did nothing, and President Obama felt he had to extend most of the tax cuts or watch the economy sink back into recession.“New occasions make for new truths,” said Representative Danny K. Davis, a Democrat from Illinois and a veteran of the partisan wars over the Bush tax cuts. “New situations make ancient remedies uncouth.”Most galling for Republicans are provisions projected to add $330 billion in spending over 10 years, including $30 billion in unemployment compensation and $21 billion in payments to Medicare health providers. None of those provisions are objectionable on their own, but collectively they almost proved impossible for Republicans to accept.Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts, R. Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist, was not crowing about their potential enshrinement. He said some Bush-era policies were no longer relevant to the task of tailoring a tax code to a properly sized government.The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts “are not the best anchoring point” for that debate, he said. “We need a tax system that can promote economic growth and raise the revenue the American people want to devote to government.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/some-liberals-say-obama-squandered-his-tax-leverage.html,"WASHINGTON — For President Obama, the fiscal deal passed by Congress on Tuesday finally ends four years of debate with Republicans about raising tax rates on the wealthy. But it seemed to reopen a debate within his party about the nature of his leadership and his skills as a negotiator.While Mr. Obama got most of what he sought in the agreement, he found himself under withering criticism from some in his liberal base who accused him of caving in to Republicans by not taxing the rich more. Just as Speaker John A. Boehner has been under pressure from his right, Mr. Obama faces a virtual Tea Party of the left that sees his compromise as capitulation.The main difference is that in the Obama era, the Democratic establishment has been less influenced, or intimidated, by the left than the Republican establishment has been by the right. Liberals have not mounted sustained primary challenges to take out wayward incumbents the way conservatives have. All but three Democrats voting in the Senate and 16 in the House supported the compromise on Tuesday, even as most House Republicans balked, giving Mr. Obama more room to operate than Mr. Boehner.But the wave of grievance from liberal activists, labor leaders and economists suggested that the uneasy truce between Mr. Obama and his base that held through the campaign season had expired now that there was no longer a threat of a Mitt Romney victory. It also offered a harbinger of the president’s next four years.The criticism has irritated the White House, which argued that Mr. Obama held true to principle by forcing Republicans to raise income tax rates on the wealthy and extend unemployment benefits and targeted tax credits. Mr. Obama also quashed Republican demands to trim the growth of entitlement benefits. Aides dismissed armchair criticism from those who have never had to negotiate with intractable opposition.“There’s some frustration that over time you would think everybody would have a better understanding of the parameters of this,” said Robert Gibbs, a longtime adviser to Mr. Obama who once called such critics “the professional left.” “But he understands now probably better than at any other point in his presidency what it means to be a leader, what it means to have to do things that are good not just for one party but good for the country.”The criticism from the left mirrors past complaints when Mr. Obama included tax cuts in his stimulus package, gave up on a government-run option in health care negotiations and temporarily extended Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy two years ago. Liberals said Mr. Obama should have capitalized on his re-election victory and the expiration on New Year’s Day of all of the Bush tax cuts to force Republicans to accept his terms.“The president remains clueless about how to use leverage in a negotiation,” said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal advocacy organization. “Republicans publicly admitted they lost the tax debate and would be forced to cave, yet the president just kept giving stuff away.”Robert B. Reich, the former labor secretary, said that Mr. Obama “has stiffened his tactical resolve” but that “he’s still the same President Obama who wants a deal above all else and seems willing to compromise on even the most basic principle.”Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in a Twitter message on Monday that the agreement was “not a good fiscal cliff deal if it gives more tax cuts to 2 percent.” Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said on the floor on Monday that “this looks like a very bad deal.”Still, most Democratic lawmakers accepted it, however reluctantly, concluding that voting against it could cause greater economic disruption. Many liberals grew more comfortable once they learned more about the deal, and the revolt on Tuesday by House Republicans seemed to rally them behind the plan and against a common adversary. Mr. Trumka released a new statement hailing elements of the deal, while blaming “Republican hostage taking” for its flaws.Mr. Obama succeeded in forcing Senate Republicans to raise the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent despite their adamant opposition, although he agreed to apply that to household income above $450,000, instead of $250,000. He also won an increase in taxes on wealthy estates to 40 percent from 35 percent, though it was not as high as liberals wanted.The bill will extend unemployment benefits for two million Americans; renew tax credits for child care, college tuition and renewable energy production; raise capital gains taxes; and phase out deductions for the wealthy. Mr. Obama also insisted that a two-month postponement of automatic spending cuts be financed by $1 in tax revenue for every $1 in spending reductions.“When the dust settles, there will be a lot of important elements in this for progressives,” Mr. Gibbs said. The deal can be evaluated only in combination with the result of the next fiscal talks, to be concluded by the end of February, he said, adding, “We won’t know the final score on that until you look at both of those negotiations together.”Defenders of the White House said it was ludicrous to expect that the president would not have to compromise, given that Republicans control the House and have enough votes in the Senate to filibuster a bill. Without an agreement, economists warned that the country would have been pushed back into recession.Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said Mr. Obama had secured important victories like the one on unemployment benefits and stood firm against paring entitlement benefits. “The president was strong there,” he told CNN. “And I think he’ll continue to be strong. I think, you know, I notice a different president since he won this election.”Jared Bernstein, a former economics adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Mr. Obama had done what he thought he had to, but he expressed concern that the president might have squandered leverage unless he holds firm in the debate over the debt ceiling. Republicans want to use a vote to raise the ceiling to force Mr. Obama to accept deeper spending cuts, but the president has vowed not to negotiate over the borrowing limit.“While some appear to think his team folded in the cliff debate, I don’t see it that way,” Mr. Bernstein said. “They saw a plausible path forward, and they took it. My point is it’s only plausible if they really don’t get derailed on the debt ceiling debate.”"

The rebels, camped within 45 miles of Bangui, accuse Mr. Bozizé of reneging on a 2007 deal to give money and jobs to former rebels, and their leaders are now split over whether to accept an offer of new talks."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/world/middleeast/comedian-accused-of-insulting-egyptian-president-to-be-investigated.html,"Prosecutors in Cairo opened a criminal investigation on Tuesday into allegations that a popular television comedian, Bassem Youssef, who has taken special aim at ultraconservative Islamists on his program, had insulted Egypt’s president, Mohamed Morsi, during his satirical monologues.  The accusations against Mr. Youssef come amid growing fears among Egypt’s media professionals that the country’s newly ratified Constitution offers scant protections for freedom of expression.Since Mr. Morsi was elected in June, the authorities have opened investigations into several media figures accused of insulting him or the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamist group he once led.An Islamist lawyer who filed the complaint against Mr. Youssef, Ramadan al-Aqsuri, said a skit in which the comedian printed a picture of Mr. Morsi’s face on a red pillow amounted to a “sharp attack on the person of the president.” Separately, a Muslim Brotherhood lawyer filed a lawsuit asking the state to pull Mr. Youssef’s show off the air and to close down the channel that carries it, citing “sarcasm against the president.”  "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/business/economy/a-bigger-tax-bite-for-most-households-under-senate-plan.html,"WASHINGTON — Only the most affluent American households will pay higher income taxes this year under the terms of a deal that passed Congress on Tuesday, but most households will face higher payroll taxes because the deal does not extend a two-year-old tax break.The legislation, which was forged in the Senate and overcame resistance in the House late Tuesday will grant most Americans an instant reversal of the income tax increases that took effect with the arrival of the new year. Only about 0.7 percent of households will be subject to an income tax increase this year, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. The increases will apply almost exclusively to households making at least half a million dollars, the center estimated in an analysis published Tuesday.But lawmakers’ decision not to reverse a scheduled increase in the payroll tax that finances Social Security, while widely expected, still means that about 77 percent of households will pay a larger share of income to the federal government this year, according to the center’s analysis.The tax this year will increase by two percentage points, to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent, on all earned income up to $113,700.Indeed, for most lower- and middle-income households, the payroll tax increase will most likely equal or exceed the value of the income tax savings. A household earning $50,000 in 2013, roughly the national median, will avoid paying about $1,000 more in income taxes — but pay about $1,000 more in payroll taxes.Sabrina Garcia, a 35-year-old accounting assistant from Quincy, Mass., who together with her husband made about $102,000 last year, said the payroll tax increase equated to “about $200 a month for my family.”“That’s a lot of money for us,” Ms. Garcia said. “It means we will have to cut back.” She said in an e-mail exchange that she will most likely will postpone buying a new computer. “And forget about being able to save money,” she added.The deal will impose larger tax increases on those who make the most. It will raise taxes in two ways: by restoring limits on the amount of income affluent Americans can shelter from federal taxation, and by returning to a top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent. The current rate is 35 percent.For married couples filing jointly, the deduction limits apply to income above $300,000, while the top tax rate kicks in above $450,000. But both numbers are somewhat misleading, because “income” in this context is a technical term, referring only to the portion of income subject to taxation after exemptions and deductions.Few households with actual incomes of less than half a million dollars will face a tax increase. The Tax Policy Center calculated that less than 5 percent of families earning $200,000 to $500,000 will actually pay more.The size of those increases will be much smaller than President Obama originally proposed. The net effect, according to the center’s estimates, is that the top 1 percent of households will see an average income tax increase this year of $62,000 rather than $94,000. “The high-income people really are doing very well in this compared to what the president wanted to do,” said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.The deal passed by the Senate and the House will impose fewer limits on deductions than the White House plan. It will also tax income from dividends at a flat rate of 20 percent, rather than the same marginal rate as earned income. And there is another important point, often misunderstood: Affluent households will pay the new 39.6 percent rate only on income above $450,000. They and everyone else will still will pay lower rates on income below that threshold.Households making $500,000 to $1 million will pay an additional $6,700 in taxes on average. Those making more than $1 million will pay an additional $123,000 on average.Changes in the estate tax will also benefit affluent families. The tax will not apply to the first $5 million of an inheritance, extending the current exclusion rather than reverting to the $3.5 million threshold that President Obama initially favored. However, wealth above that amount will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent rather than the previous rate of 35 percent.The Obama administration did win a five-year extension of tax breaks for lower-income families, including the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit. Those credits eliminate income tax liability for many lower-income families. In many cases, the government actually makes a direct payment to the family to help offset the burden of payroll taxation — up to $1,000 a child under the child credit and up to $5,900 total under the earned income credit.The deal will also restore unemployment benefits for about two million Americans. People who can’t find work, and have already received government checks for the standard period of 26 weeks, have been able to stay on the rolls for up to an additional 47 weeks. But financing for that program, which is aimed at the states with the highest unemployment rates, expired Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, people who are eligible will receive any missed benefits retroactively.The deal also includes new rules for the alternative minimum tax, which threatened this year to impose higher taxes on roughly 30 million households. The tax was created in the 1960s to set a lower limit on the taxes paid by the most affluent households, but the eligibility threshold was not indexed to inflation, so it theoretically encompasses a larger share of households with each passing year. Congress has repeatedly passed short-term increases in the threshold; the deal will make those increases automatic, obviating the annual ritual.That is small consolation for middle-income Americans like Joe Interlandi, 61, a long-haul trucker who on Tuesday was driving a load of tomatoes from Florida to Los Angeles.Mr. Interlandi, writing from a rest stop, said he understood the need for higher taxes. He will rather pay more now than impose higher taxes on his children and grandchildren, he said.But Mr. Interlandi, who estimated that he worked 100 hours many weeks, added that the payroll tax increase still meant he will need to spend even more time on the road.

OneRepublic’s song, called “Feel Again,” was released in August on iTunes and will be featured on the group’s album, “Native,” to be released in March.The campaign is BBDO’s second for Save the Children, based in Westport, Conn., and the Ad Council; its first was introduced in 2010. Both campaigns were created to support the newborn and child survival efforts, primarily overseas, of Save the Children. According to Unicef data, about seven million children a year die before their fifth birthday, mostly from preventable and treatable causes like pneumonia, diarrhea and neonatal complications. Newborns account for 40 percent of those deaths.David Lubars, chairman and chief creative officer of BBDO North America, said that when the agency began working with Save the Children, it decided to use the organization’s “unheralded” health workers to illustrate its aid efforts. The first campaign depicted actual workers in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, walking to work in rural villages and examining children.The new campaign came about, Mr. Lubars said, when BBDO discovered a new type of stethoscope that lets the user listen to and record a patient’s heartbeat. It hired the documentary makers Sean and Andrea Fine, who have worked in Uganda and India, to film a local health worker, trained by Save the Children, in a rural village in Malawi.The Fines’s 90-second television spot opens with the health worker, Chisomo Boxer, preparing for work and waiting on his bicycle on a dirt road. It then shows an airplane flying over rural Africa, carrying a box that is unloaded from the plane and delivered to Mr. Boxer. He enters the village, surrounded by children, and opens the box, which contains a special stethoscope. He uses it to listen to and record the children’s heartbeats and to assess their health.The second half of the spot shows the Denver recording studio of OneRepublic. The group’s lead singer, Ryan Tedder, plugs a cable into the stethoscope, listens to the heartbeats of the children from Malawi and composes a song incorporating them. OneRepublic is then shown recording the song.The ad concludes with Mr. Boxer riding his bicycle in Malawi with the stethoscope strapped to it, the village children running behind him. “Feel Again” is played, and a voice-over says: “This song was created with heartbeats of children in need. Find out how it can help front-line health workers bring hope to millions of children at EveryBeatMatters.org,” a Web site that BBDO created for the campaign.BBDO also designed three print ads, each a “heartbeat portrait” of a different aid worker, one of whom is Mr. Boxer. Each portrait is made up of dozens of real electrocardiogram images; the name of each child whose electrocardiogram is shown is printed in tiny type to the left of the image.The copy on Mr. Boxer’s ad says: “Actual heartbeats from the children Chisomo saved in Malawi created this portrait of him. Help front-line health workers like Chisomo bring hope to millions of children at EveryBeatMatters.org.”The campaign also includes Web banners that employ Mr. Boxer’s “heartbeat portrait,” radio spots featuring Mr. Tedder, outdoor ads and Facebook and Twitter initiatives encouraging people to download OneRepublic’s song.In addition, BBDO created an interactive kiosk that lets users plug their headphones into stethoscopes to listen to a child’s heartbeat, “Feel Again” and a message from Mr. Tedder. The kiosk was on display last month at the One Club in New York, and the Ad Council is arranging new sites for it this year.Mr. Tedder said all the proceeds — both to the band and to its record label, Interscope — from the first 750,000 downloads of the song on iTunes would go to Save the Children. According to Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive of the Ad Council, the song has been downloaded more than 600,000 times so far.Mr. Tedder, who has a young son, went to Guatemala after he wrote “Feel Again” to see firsthand how children lived there. “In many cases, the only thing that keeps these kids alive is these front-line health workers trained by Save the Children,” he said.The campaign’s Web site was introduced in August, and the Ad Council began distributing its ads in September. “The goal of the campaign is to create awareness and raise money,” Mr. Lubars, the BBDO North America chairman, said. “We wanted to make it very personal, not negative, uplifting.”Ms. Conlon said the intended audience for the campaign was “people who care about international childhood mortality, who are likely to be more involved with charitable work.” She added that it was the first time the Ad Council had relied heavily on the contributions of a pop music group in the creation of a campaign.Mary Beth Powers, chief of Save the Children’s newborn and child survival campaign, said Mr. Tedder’s involvement “certainly brings new, younger audiences to the issue of child survival.”She also said Save the Children hoped the new campaign would inspire Americans to tell elected officials that “they can’t balance the budget” — which has in the past contained financing for foreign aid programs — “on the backs of women and children globally.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/nyregion/billions-in-aid-for-hurricane-sandy-victims-in-danger-of-stalling.html,"A bill to provide tens of billions of dollars in federal aid to states pummeled by Hurricane Sandy was in danger of dying Tuesday night as the House seemed headed for adjournment without taking up the legislation.The developments in the House dealt a major blow to leaders from the storm-battered region, who had been pushing top Republicans in the chamber to adopt a $60.4 billion aid package that the Senate passed last week.Lawmakers and a top Republican aide said late Tuesday that Speaker John A. Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, appeared unwilling to introduce any Hurricane Sandy aid legislation before the chamber adjourns in the next day or so. If the legislation is not introduced before the session ends, it would have to be reintroduced in the new Congress and passed by both chambers.The developments came after days in which top House Republicans left open the possibility that they would take up an aid package after coming under intense pressure from political leaders and lawmakers from the storm-ravaged region.The storm spending bill was apparently a victim of bad timing. It has been eclipsed by negotiations between Democrats and Republicans over a plan intended to avert a series of tax increases and spending cuts that automatically took effect in the New Year.As word spread that the leadership would not consider any storm spending package this session, a procession of New York and New Jersey lawmakers went to the House floor Tuesday night to denounce the Republican leadership, in particular the speaker.“This is absolutely indefensible,” said Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island. “We have a moral obligation to hold this vote.”Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Westchester County, echoed the sentiment. “I truly feel betrayed this evening,” she said. “We can pass this bill tomorrow with bipartisan support.”In the Senate, there was equal dismay. “It is truly heartless that the House will not even allow the Sandy bill to come to the floor for a vote, and Speaker Boehner should reconsider his ill-advised decision,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. The $60.4 billion bill would cover an assortment of pressing needs. It includes money to help homeowners and small-business owners rebuild; to repair bridges, tunnels and transportation systems; to reimburse local governments for overtime costs of police, fire and other emergency services; and to replenish shorelines.That package would fall far short of the $82 billion that governors from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have said would be needed to continue cleaning up and rebuilding after the storm.But leaders from the region nonetheless embraced it as a good start that would enable local governments, businesses, homeowners and others hurt by the storm to undertake rebuilding projects with the confidence that federal aid was on the way."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/ncaafootball/governor-announces-lawsuit-against-ncaa-over-penn-state-penalties.html,"Perhaps no Pennsylvania public official has been more involved with the Penn State child sexual abuse scandal than Gov. Tom Corbett.In 2009, when he was the state’s attorney general, Corbett began an investigation into allegations that the former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky had abused young boys. Later, as governor, Corbett took a seat on Penn State’s board of trustees, serving in that post as his former office brought charges against Sandusky and three top university officials, and as the N.C.A.A. levied severe penalties against the university and its football program.Now, Corbett has sued the N.C.A.A. on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, alleging that it was “overreaching and unlawful” in how it punished the university, and that it broke antitrust laws and harmed residents in the process.“These sanctions did not punish Sandusky, nor did they punish the others who have been criminally charged,” Corbett said Wednesday at a news conference in State College, Pa. “Rather, they punished the past, the present, the local businesses and the citizens of Pennsylvania.”The lawsuit, a straightforward challenge to the N.C.A.A.’s authority, asks a federal court to throw out all of the penalties against Penn State’s football program, including a $60 million fine, the vacating of a decade’s worth of victories, and a four-year ban on postseason play. However, some legal experts, including ones who have litigated against the N.C.A.A. on antitrust matters, said the governor would probably face difficulty in building a successful case, considering that the university accepted the penalties when they were announced in July.Penn State is not a party to the lawsuit. It said Wednesday that it planned to continue to comply with the N.C.A.A.’s punishment, which began this season. The team finished 8-4 but was not eligible to play in a bowl game.“The school has agreed to be bound by the N.C.A.A. rules; the school has accepted this penalty,” said Steve Berman, a Seattle-based lawyer who has sued the N.C.A.A. in matters unrelated to the Sandusky case. “Outsiders are going to have a tough time claiming they have standing to challenge what is going on.”Another lawyer who has litigated against the N.C.A.A., Stephen Morrissey, said there could be potential weaknesses in Corbett’s assertion that he brought the case on behalf of aggrieved businesses and residents. Such legal theory, he said, is typically applied in cases in which consumers are hurt financially.“The harm to consumers here, I guess, is that they don’t get to watch Penn State football play in bowl games they might have qualified for,” Morrissey said.More than two decades ago, courts rejected a similar lawsuit by supporters of Southern Methodist after the N.C.A.A. shut down the university’s football team — delivering the so-called death penalty — when it was found that players had been paid from a slush fund.But in the case of Penn State, Corbett said, the N.C.A.A. violated its own bylaws and forced university officials to accept the punishments under the threat of worse consequences as they were reeling from the public shame of the Sandusky scandal.Sandusky, a former top assistant to the longtime coach Joe Paterno, is serving 30 to 60 years in prison after being found guilty in June of 45 counts of abuse. Three university officials, including the former president Graham B. Spanier, have been criminally charged with taking steps to cover up his misconduct and are facing trials.In the 43-page lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Corbett described the N.C.A.A. as an embattled organization, facing criticism for not being tough enough on universities with elite athletic programs when it came to compliance matters.The suit said that the N.C.A.A.’s president, Mark Emmert, saw the “indictment of a despicable child predator” as “the opportunity he needed to signal emphatically that the N.C.A.A. — his N.C.A.A. — would never again be regarded as soft on disciplining its member institutions.”The lawsuit alleged that the N.C.A.A. violated antitrust laws, saying Emmert and the organization “exercised their power through a never-before-used process, one specifically designed to cripple a member institution’s football program.” The lawsuit said that N.C.A.A. leaders, rather than traditional investigators, imposed the penalties, putting aside rules and asserting unusual authority in punishing the university.“While what occurred at Penn State was both criminal and heinous, it is unclear, at best, that the conduct violated any of the rules as written in the N.C.A.A.’s voluminous rulebook and policed by its enforcement staff,” the lawsuit said.When imposing its punishment of Penn State, the N.C.A.A. relied largely on an investigation by Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director, that had been commissioned by the university. The investigation found that top university officials had shown a disregard for the welfare of children and actively concealed Sandusky’s assaults because they feared that the publicity would hurt the football program.In the lawsuit, Corbett called the Penn State football program “an important economic engine supporting Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth,” saying that the program earned more than $50 million a year. He said the N.C.A.A.’s actions hurt Pennsylvanians who depended on the football program for their livelihood, while also dampening ticket sales, diminishing state revenue and harming “current Penn State students, in the form of diminution of the Penn State educational and community experience to which they and their families made a significant and long-term financial commitment, relying in part on the prominence of the Penn State football program.”The N.C.A.A. said in a statement that it was “disappointed” by the lawsuit and called it a “setback to the university’s efforts” after the scandal.“Not only does this forthcoming lawsuit appear to be without merit, it is an affront to all of the victims in this tragedy — lives that were destroyed by the criminal actions of Jerry Sandusky,” Donald Remy, the organization’s general counsel, said. “While the innocence that was stolen can never be restored, Penn State has accepted the consequences for its role and the role of its employees and is moving forward.”Corbett, a Republican, had faced criticism from some who said he did not move quickly enough with the initial investigation into the allegations against Sandusky because of concerns about alienating Penn State alumni as he ran for governor. He is up for re-election next year. During her recent campaign, Kathleen Kane, the state’s incoming Democratic attorney general, said she would investigate Corbett’s handling of the case.If Pennsylvania’s case gains traction, it could potentially undermine the N.C.A.A.’s handling of enforcement issues with other universities.“The N.C.A.A.’s authority comes in large part from its membership,” said Tyrone Thomas, a Washington lawyer who advises universities in N.C.A.A. compliance matters. “These institutions are agreeing by their membership and signing off on this. You’d now have a third party involved.”That, he said, “could change how the dynamic works.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/judge-rules-memo-on-targeted-killing-can-remain-secret.html,"WASHINGTON — A federal judge in Manhattan refused on Wednesday to require the Justice Department to disclose a memorandum providing the legal justification for the targeted killing of a United States citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, who died in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.The ruling, by Judge Colleen McMahon, was marked by skepticism about the antiterrorist program that targeted him, and frustration with her own role in keeping the legal rationale for it secret.“I can find no way around the thicket of laws and precedents that effectively allow the executive branch of our government to proclaim as perfectly lawful certain actions that seem on their face incompatible with our Constitution and laws while keeping the reasons for their conclusion a secret,” she wrote.“The Alice-in-Wonderland nature of this pronouncement is not lost on me,” Judge McMahon wrote, adding that she was operating in a legal environment that amounted to “a veritable Catch-22.”A lawsuit for the memorandum and related materials was filed under the Freedom of Information Act by The New York Times and two of its reporters, Charlie Savage and Scott Shane. Wednesday’s decision also rejected a broader request under the act from the American Civil Liberties Union.David E. McCraw, a lawyer for The Times, said the paper would appeal.“We began this litigation because we believed our readers deserved to know more about the U.S. government’s legal position on the use of targeted killings against persons having ties to terrorism, including U.S. citizens,” Mr. McCraw said. “Judge McMahon’s decision speaks eloquently and at length to the serious legal questions raised by the targeted-killing program and to why in a democracy the government should be addressing those questions openly and fully.”Jameel Jaffer, a lawyer with the A.C.L.U., said his group also planned to appeal. “This ruling,” he said, “denies the public access to crucial information about the government’s extrajudicial killing of U.S. citizens and also effectively greenlights its practice of making selective and self-serving disclosures.”A Justice Department spokesman said only that lawyers there were reviewing the decision.Judge McMahon’s opinion included an overview of what she called “an extensive public relations campaign” by various government officials about the American role in the killing of Mr. Awlaki and the circumstances under which the government considers targeted killings, including of its citizens, to be lawful. The Times and the A.C.L.U. argued that the government had waived the right to withhold its legal rationale by discussing the program extensively in public.(Samir Khan, a naturalized American citizen who lived at times on Long Island and in North Carolina, was also killed in the strike, on Sept. 30, 2011. Another strike two weeks later killed a group of people including Mr. Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who was born in Colorado.)President Obama and Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta both acknowledged that the United States played a role in the elder Mr. Awlaki’s death, Judge McMahon wrote. But she focused in particular on a March speech by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. at Northwestern University.When United States citizens are targeted for killing, Mr. Holder said, the Constitution’s due process protections apply. But due process does not require “judicial process,” he added.On the one hand, Judge McMahon wrote, “the speech constitutes a sort of road map of the decision-making process that the government goes through before deciding to ‘exterminate’ someone ‘with extreme prejudice.’ ” On the other hand, the speech was “a far cry from a legal research memorandum.”The government’s public comments were as a whole “cryptic and imprecise,” Judge McMahon said, and were thus insufficient to overcome exemptions in the freedom of information law for classified materials and internal government deliberations.“It lies beyond the power of this court to conclude that a document has been improperly classified,” she wrote, rejecting the argument that legal analysis may not be classified.Judge McMahon said she had not reviewed the withheld documents, including the one at the heart of the case, which was prepared by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel. She said the memorandum must contain more detailed legal analysis than the broad statements in Mr. Holder’s speech “unless standards at O.L.C. have slipped dramatically.”The Times published an account of the Office of Legal Counsel memorandum in October 2011, citing people who had read it.Even as she ruled against the plaintiffs, the judge wrote that the public should be allowed to judge whether the administration’s analysis holds water.“More fulsome disclosure of the legal reasoning on which the administration relies to justify the targeted killing of individuals, including United States citizens, far from any recognizable ‘hot’ field of battle, would allow for intelligent discussion and assessment of a tactic that (like torture before it) remains hotly debated,” she wrote."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/opinion/how-to-get-a-new-assault-weapons-ban-through-congress.html,"WashingtonCALLING the massacre in Newtown, Conn., “the worst day of my presidency,” President Obama recently told NBC’s David Gregory: “My response is, something has to work. And it is not enough for us to say, ‘This is too hard, so we’re not going to try.’ ”Almost 20 years ago, Senator Dianne Feinstein and other lawmakers took the same approach to build a bipartisan majority in Congress, tortuously, vote by vote, for legislation banning the future manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.As Senator Feinstein’s counsel for the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1993, I worked with her to get the assault weapons bill to President Bill Clinton’s desk. But the legislation expired in 2004 and hasn’t been renewed. Understanding what worked then is the key to doing it again in the new Congress, as Senator Feinstein has vowed to do.Then, as now, legislation was the product of spectacular violence. On July 1, 1993, a man carrying two semiautomatic pistols equipped with high-capacity ammunition magazines and “hellfire” triggers, and another pistol, strolled off an elevator in a San Francisco building. He entered the offices of a law firm and killed eight people and injured six others before taking his own life. In the wake of that horror, Senator Feinstein asked me to review earlier bills by two other Democratic senators at the time, Dennis DeConcini of Arizona and Howard M. Metzenbaum of Ohio, and blend them with her own proposals to create meaningful new legislation that could pass Congress.The law that resulted is best known for regulating certain semiautomatic weapons and large ammunition magazines, but it’s worth remembering that its official name was the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act.That title wasn’t a euphemism: the law needed support from lawmakers who had viewed prior legislative efforts as toothless, as well as those who feared that a ban on assault weapons could lead to the confiscation of guns used for hunting and target shooting.The bill had three main components. The first was a list of well-known, deeply feared guns that were banned by name (like Uzis). The second banned the future manufacture and sale of any new semiautomatic weapon with a detachable magazine and more than two of several assault-style features (like a forward handgrip). The third and most critical section was Appendix A, which listed every single hunting rifle and shotgun in use at the time — there were hundreds — that didn’t run afoul of the features test in the second component. Those firearms were unequivocally exempted from the bill.At the time, gun-control advocates resisted the incorporation of Appendix A. But the idea behind it was and remains crucial to making any meaningful changes in America’s gun laws. They must gain the support of gun owners, most of whom are heartsick over senseless carnage.By explicitly protecting hundreds of popular sporting guns, the bill enabled senators and representatives to push back against the tide of protests — many of them generated by the National Rifle Association — at town hall-style meetings in their states and districts. They could show their constituents that their ordinary hunting rifles and shotguns were protected in Appendix A or that their guns could be added to it, if need be. Proponents of the legislation distributed blue booklets describing all three parts of the bill, including pictures of the assault weapons banned by name and the full list of guns protected by Appendix A.The nation’s principal law enforcement organizations, whose leaders testified and lobbied aggressively for the bill, also made great use of the booklets and Appendix A. In fact, it was a survey showing overwhelming support for an assault-weapons ban from police chiefs in and around his Congressional district that persuaded Representative Henry J. Hyde of Illinois, the top Republican on the House Judiciary Committee at the time, to support the bill. His surprise yes vote offset the no vote of the committee’s conservative chairman, Representative Jack Brooks, a Texas Democrat, so that the bill could move to the floor of the House.The existence of Appendix A also made it possible for Senator Ben Nighthorse Campbell, a Colorado Democrat and longtime N.R.A. member — coupled with his own reaction to a torrent of gun-lobby phone calls — to commit to supporting Senator Feinstein’s bill if it was essential. That moment came when a motion to table, or effectively kill, the bill came before the Senate. Although the motion would have failed with a tie vote of 50 to 50, Senator Feinstein asked Senator Campbell for his vote to show that a majority of senators supported the bill. He honored his commitment, and the motion to table failed, 49 to 51, paving the way for the ultimate passage of the bill by a vote of 57 to 43.Following the Newtown tragedy, inaction is not an option, morally or politically. President Obama and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. (who championed the original assault-weapons ban when he served in the Senate) are on the right track with their plan to present legislation before the new Congress.Preventing another slaughter will require not just new gun regulations, but also education, mental health care, greater access by law enforcement agencies to mental health records and assistance for parents, while respecting the whole Bill of Rights.But the lesson from nearly two decades ago remains clear. If any meaningful change is to come, legislators must again devise a bill that both regulates assault weapons and respects and protects gun owners.If we want to reimpose a permanent assault-weapons ban and restrict high capacity ammunition magazines, let’s include a new list of exempted rifles and shotguns used for recreational shooting in a new Appendix A (updated annually) and actively solicit input from the shooting community to make it work.If we want to require background checks for all private sales at gun shows, let’s cap the cost so that private sales aren’t prohibitively expensive. Better yet, when we do this, let’s find an efficient way to allow individual sellers to directly use the same F.B.I.-managed background check system they must now pay federally licensed gun dealers to access for them.If, once and for all, we want to revoke the de facto exemption from consumer product safety regulation that, thanks to the N.R.A., guns have historically enjoyed, let’s bring them under the jurisdiction of the Consumer Product Safety Commission and require gun makers to build state-of-the-art gunlock technology (like palm- or fingerprint-recognition sensors) into every handgun or rifle. But then let’s also relieve gun owners of the burden of identifying and complying with a patchwork of different state laws covering the transport of firearms and permit, under federal law, the transport of any lawfully owned gun across state lines if it’s unloaded and locked in the trunk of a car, in a childproof case.Finally, if only because it’s the fair thing to do, let’s require states and localities to process gun registration and other applications by law-abiding gun owners within a reasonable period of time, and with firm deadlines.We need comprehensive proposals that can gain wide support. As always, the resulting legislation won’t be perfect. For example, just as in 1993, it’s unlikely that a new bill would address assault weapons that people already lawfully own — like the one Adam Lanza took from his mother before he killed her, 20 first graders, six educators and himself. We’ll have to address that problem with publicly and privately sponsored buyback programs and other approaches. But once enacted, a comprehensive bill would, over time, make “grandfathered” weapons and ammunition magazines more expensive, harder to find and harder to repair. If such a compromise kept the wrong gun out of the wrong hands just once, I’d take it, any day."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/nyregion/chris-christie-rebukes-gop-for-inaction-on-hurricane-relief-bill.html,"This is the kind of moment that, in today’s hyper-choreographed political age, does not often happen: An ambitious governor angrily denounces his own political party before a national audience, accusing its leader of “duplicity,” “selfishness” and moral failure.Who else but Chris Christie?Governor Christie, a New Jersey Republican and possible presidential candidate with a reputation for take-no-prisoners bluster, attacked the House Republican leadership on Wednesday for its refusal to allow a vote on a Hurricane Sandy relief bill the night before.Mr. Christie said the Republicans had failed a “basic test of public service.”He said “palace intrigue” had resulted in New Jersey residents’ being used “as a pawn.”And he stated that the political machinations that doomed the bill were “why the American people hate Congress; it is why they hate them.”Setting aside the usual caution that lawmakers, mindful of relationships and protocol, bring to public appearances, Mr. Christie made unequivocally clear whom he held responsible.“There’s only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims: the House majority and their speaker, John Boehner,” he said.He then reiterated that the decision to block the relief bill “was the speaker’s decision, his alone.”Those were unfettered fighting words, all the more potent emerging from the mouth of a governor who, just months ago, secured the coveted keynote spot at his party’s national convention, the traditional platform for its next anointed political star.But there may be some calculus behind Mr. Christie’s ire.The governor, who is believed to harbor presidential ambitions, has earned fans around the country with his regular-guy toughness. Some voters, disillusioned with both parties, are looking for a candidate who can claim a mantle of independence.And Mr. Christie was careful to praise the efforts of Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, another high-ranking Republican who is gaining in influence as Mr. Boehner struggles to control his caucus.The remarks were made at an uneasy time for Mr. Christie and his supporters in the Republican Party, who cultivated the governor as a rising star only to find themselves astonished and hurt by his warm embrace of President Obama in the aftermath of the hurricane, days before the November election.Some surrogates of the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, later blamed Mr. Christie for helping to turn the campaign’s momentum against him.The governor has sought to mend those ties. It was unclear whether his words on Wednesday had strained them anew.Mr. Christie reserved particular disdain for Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, saying that he had repeatedly assured him that a vote would be held on the bill and that he was offered “no credible explanation” as to why that did not happen.When he was informed, at 11:20 p.m. on Tuesday, that the bill had been scuttled, Mr. Christie said, he made four telephone calls trying to reach Mr. Boehner.“He did not take my calls,” the governor said.With that, Mr. Christie declared that he had lost trust in the most powerful elected Republican in the country.“There is no reason at the moment for me to believe anything they tell me, because they have been telling me stuff for weeks, and they didn’t deliver,” the governor said.He later added, “At the moment, I wouldn’t be looking to do much for House leadership.”The governor’s anger stood in contrast with the stoicism of another independent-minded politician. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told reporters at a more subdued appearance on Wednesday that he was confident an agreement on the relief bill would ultimately be reached.“It’s not for me to second-guess how you run a legislative body,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “I think we all know that both parties are fractured and are difficult to pull together and to lead.”It was a response that was typical of the mayor, a political independent who has shown contempt for the passions and gamesmanship that often slow down the political process.“His reaction was the same to all of these things: matter of fact,” recalled Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor who worked with Mr. Bloomberg to lobby Congress on the bill.“It was businesslike,” he said. “It was, ‘O.K., what’s the next step?’ ”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/opinion/dereliction-of-duty-more-fiscal-battles-ahead.html,"Republicans won more in the fiscal-cliff deal than they had any right to expect. Permanent tax cuts for the middle class and millions of wealthy families, a permanent break on the estate tax and dividends, a five-year limit on tax credits for low-income families, and only a single year of extended unemployment insurance. Yet 64 percent of House Republicans voted against it Tuesday night.Their explanations reeked of tired ideology about never raising anyone’s taxes and the lack of spending cuts. If not for Speaker John Boehner’s last-moment decision to allow the bill to pass without a Republican majority, everyone’s income taxes would have gone up.The unwillingness of Mr. Boehner’s caucus to join such decisions for the common good suggests that the 113th Congress, which begins on Thursday, will be bitterly unproductive, and possibly even more dangerous than the last Congress. Republicans say they are more determined than ever to extract the maximum amount of budget-cutting pain in the next two months by threatening not to raise the debt ceiling.That’s a far more serious prospect than going over the fiscal cliff. Letting the Treasury run out of borrowing authority would mean a default on the nation’s credit, a catastrophic prospect for holders of government bonds around the world. It could result in further credit downgrades and lead to sharply higher borrowing costs. It is an unimaginable prospect for a responsible country, yet it almost happened in 2011 because of the irresponsibility of Congressional Republicans.Mr. Obama sounded resolute on Tuesday night in vowing he will not submit to this blackmail. “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed,” he said. But will he really keep this promise?The White House won several victories in the fiscal-cliff package, but its eagerness for a deal disappointed many who believed the president’s promise to raise far more revenue. It is hard to see how he avoids giving in to Republican demands, as he was forced to do in 2011.Mr. Obama has also said he will demand equivalent revenue increases for every dollar of spending cuts won by Republicans over the next year. That could be done by further limits on deductions and loopholes for corporations and the rich, including eliminating the carried-interest loophole that lets hedge fund managers declare that their income is a form of capital gains. But it will be a struggle to uphold that pledge, given the maddening nature of his opponents.In the weeks to come, Republicans will use not just the debt-ceiling threat, but also the $100 billion across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, delayed for two months in this week’s deal, and the potential shutdown of the government when the current spending resolution expires in March. Standing up to brinkmanship will require a level of resolve that the president has yet to fully demonstrate."

That’s at the bottom of a sample pile of the world’s critical industrial and emerging economies, about half the rate of the United States’ or Britain’s expansion, behind France, Italy and even Greece, and left in the dust by India, China, Indonesia and Mexico.Angela Merkel, who faces re-election this fall, could well shrug and say to herself, I’ll be 106 before I’m accountable in the face of that piece of computerized clairvoyance — however estimable the source.Still, starting now, the O.E.C.D. considers that the German economy will trend downward over a half century at levels increasingly under 1.5 percent growth, which, while not total stagnation, means little more than marking time. That doesn’t work as a credible perspective for a country that wants to call the shots in Europe. If this is where austerity in lifetime-doses leads you, then where’s the justification of the German blueprint for the rest of the European Union?Germany in 2013 is also a country whose banks are in notoriously risky condition; whose population is expected to lose 17 million inhabitants by 2060; and whose domestic automobile industry is reported to have produced 500,000 fewer cars in 2012 than the previous year.In the short term, the Bundesbank asserts real G.D.P. growth will top out at 0.7 percent in 2012 and 0.4 percent in 2013. Not good. After a return to levels of around 1.5 percent, the O.E.C.D. said in another assessment that, without significant reform programs, Germany’s rate of expansion would dip under 1 percent from 2020.Doubting voices are becoming louder. Alain Minc, a former economic adviser to President Nicolas Sarkozy, now describes Deutsche Bank as a “world problem” and said, “I’m convinced Germany will be worse off in five years. Its demography is bad. It has no significant gains in competitiveness. It’s at its apogee and will start to decline.”Why is this so counterintuitive? Because Germany has been brilliantly sold with the help of Merkel’s placid, elevator-music manner. Der Spiegel has written she dispenses the truth to Germans in “homeopathic doses.” Indeed, those sparing spoonfuls are what the external world has often swallowed. Example: In autumn 2011, talking about the German economy’s world role, she bragged: “We’re the locomotive again.”A few days later, Wolfgang Franz, chairman of the chancellor’s committee of economic advisers, contradicted her. He said that there were no more economic locomotives in the world, and insisted that there was nothing in the German economy to signal a long sweep of growth since Germany had basically “spent its structural reforms of 2005.”Who listened to what turned out to be the truth? The fact is, once she took office in 2005, Merkel never felt she had to pay attention to her own campaign rhetoric favoring further labor market streamlining. Her Germany certainly did not listen when the G-20 group of economic powers signaled in 2009 for the country to cut its export surpluses by increasing domestic demand. Following through with real effort would have meant opening new markets to its European neighbors and encouraging German consumer spending.Now, the O.E.C.D. identifies the decline in Germany’s working population as a central factor in the projection of its economic shrinkage. Sure, the circumstances help provide relatively low unemployment numbers (6.9 percent). Yes, retirement at 67 has been voted into law — but it is only scheduled to come into full effect in 2030, when it might have to be upped again to age 70.And those German banks, described in 2010 by a German member of the European Commission as “the world’s riskiest”? The O.E.C.D. last year reported the “high vulnerability” of the system and found that “a reform of the sector is still lacking.”Taken together, since Merkel likes little steps, and not big, legible plans for Europe, her overall vision for its future still represents a very German outline. Under the E.U.’s planned banking supervisory system, Germany’s insistence has resulted in its officials, not European ones, being designated to oversee the country’s rickety public banks.It’s a consistently stubborn approach. In 2060, according to the O.E.C.D.’s long-range calculations, Germany will still be running a current account surplus — an imbalance hardly marked by selflessness and generosity — while the biggest players like China and India are projected over time to have moved into current account deficit status.This fall, Merkel’s Social Democratic opponent will be Peer Steinbrück, an abrasive man who served as her finance minister during the 2005-2009 grand coalition, and initially rejected the notion of Europe-wide bailout packages (he couldn’t trust the neighbors).Whatever the realities of Germany’s diminishing momentum, the poll numbers and the S.P.D.’s similarities to Merkel in defining her country’s self-interest say she will be re-elected."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/business/some-breaks-for-industries-are-retained-in-fiscal-deal.html,"Nearly $250 million for Hollywood. Over $330 million for the railroad industry. More than $220 million for rum producers. And $62 million for doing business in American Samoa.While taxes are expected to increase for most Americans as a result of the deal between the White House and Congress to end the fiscal impasse in Washington, corporate America was more fortunate. A bevy of tax breaks and credits that had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 will be extended for another year, costing taxpayers $46.1 billion over the next decade, according to Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation.The preservation of these subsidies and deductions has become a perennial Washington ritual in recent years, with lobbyists and companies and their allies on Capitol Hill securing their survival in the fine print of the tax code. Washington’s inability to close many of these loopholes is a sign of just how reluctant business is to sacrifice prized subsidies despite loud calls from many chief executives in recent months to raise taxes, cut spending and deal with huge budget deficits.“Except for the people who like it, it’s a giveaway,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “It’s hard to mobilize opposition, but the people who benefit from it benefit a lot.”Many of the provisions survive because they are so obscure. A $62 million tax credit for employers in American Samoa benefits StarKist, which is the largest private employer in the South Pacific island chain, with nearly 2,000 workers there. The tax break was supported by Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who as former chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was an advocate for American territories that lack formal Senate representation.“We support the development credit, and it’s a key factor in our ability to maintain competitive operations in American Samoa,” said Mary Sestric, a spokeswoman for StarKist. “This is a big priority for us.”Corporations were keenly sensitive to changes in broader tax policy, in addition to benefiting from direct tax breaks. For example, Goldman Sachs distributed $65 million in stock to 10 senior executives in December instead of January, when the firm typically makes such awards. That move helped them avoid the higher tax rates that will now be imposed on income of $400,000 or more.The chief executive of Goldman, Lloyd C. Blankfein, was among the most prominent corporate executives who backed higher taxes as part of a broader deficit-reduction package. He and other business leaders also met with President Obama late last year as the White House sought support from corporate America during negotiations with Republicans in Congress.Some subsidies, like a break for research by companies, can actually have long-term benefits for the economy, defenders argue.Others, like the one that allows filmmakers to deduct the first $15 million in production expenses for movies made in the United States, are much more narrowly focused but have loyal supporters that manage to keep them alive year after year. Another beneficiary of Congressional largess is Nascar, which will enjoy a $78 million subsidy for racetrack construction over the next 10 years.“Once they get in, they tend to stay in,” said Alan Auerbach, director of the Robert D. Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California, Berkeley.Besides the $46.1 billion in corporate incentives over the next 10 years, there is another $18.1 billion in breaks for alternative energy, much of that going to companies as well. Producers of biodiesel, for example, will reap more than $2 billion in tax breaks. And while it may not exactly be an alternative source of energy, producers of coal on Indian lands retained $1 million in tax breaks — a provision backed by Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee.The wind industry, a chief beneficiary of support from Washington, will get $12 billion in subsidies over the next decade. In fact, the benefits that were included for the wind sector are slightly broader now than in previous years.Under the new rules, contained in the legislation that Mr. Obama signed on Wednesday, new wind farms will be covered by a production tax credit or an investment tax credit similar to the ones that just expired, but the projects will not need to be finished by the end of this year to qualify; they simply must have been started in 2013.The American Wind Energy Association, a trade group, said in an e-mail to its members that the change was made by Congress “specifically in order to accommodate the business timelines of our industry.” The business has been in a tax-driven boom-and-bust cycle.The renewal of the tax benefits was pushed strongly by Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Baucus and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. When the Senate began considering “tax extenders,” or continuations of various tax breaks, wind advocates pushed to have all of them included.“There always seemed to be some bipartisan support for this,” said Philip D. Tingle, a lawyer who specializes in energy taxes. “The element, the issue was, how they were going to pay for it.” The renewal will probably cost the Treasury about $12 billion, although the wind industry insists that it will generate so much taxable activity that total tax revenue, including those at the state and local level, will exceed the tax expenditure.The industry undertook a large lobbying campaign and says it generated more than 750,000 letters, e-mails and other communications with Congress. It took nearly 100 members of Congress on tours of wind farms and factories where components are built. The issue may be more regional than partisan; according to the American Wind Energy Association, 80 percent of wind farms are in Congressional districts represented by Republicans, as are 67 percent of the factories.The tax credits were also extended to cover electricity made from biomass, tides and ocean waves, landfill methane and improvements to hydroelectric stations."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/world/europe/putin-orders-new-system-for-russian-parliamentary-elections.html,"MOSCOW — President Vladimir V. Putin has ordered a major change in the rules for parliamentary elections, a move that could help solidify his power and influence toward the end of his current term and insulate him from dwindling public support for United Russia, the party that nominated him and currently holds a majority in Parliament.At Mr. Putin’s direction, half of the 450 seats in the State Duma, the lower house of Parliament, would be filled using a proportional system based on votes for parties, with each party then filling its allotted seats. The other half would be filled by direct election of individual candidates, creating a potential opening for independent campaigns.The new system, which the Central Election Commission is expected to unveil in the next several weeks, replaces a system of strict party-list voting. It would be the second major change to the parliamentary voting process in less than a decade and essentially amounts to a return to a system that had been in place through 2003. The proposal also comes just a year after allegations of widespread fraud in the parliamentary elections in December 2011 set off a wave of huge street protests in Moscow.But while the prospect of individual candidacies suggests a liberalizing of a political system often criticized as heavily tilted in favor of Mr. Putin and the governing authorities, history shows that they can actually have the opposite effect.This is because individual candidates endorsed by the majority party tend to have a huge advantage in name recognition and resources in local races, and because candidates who run locally as independents can often be enticed to join the majority party when the new Parliament is formed, using perks offered by the presidential administration.In neighboring Ukraine, the adoption of a mixed electoral system like the one proposed by Mr. Putin helped President Viktor F. Yanukovich’s Party of Regions win more seats in elections this fall, despite public opinion polls — and even election results — that showed support for the party had dropped across the country.In 2007, under a system of proportional voting for party lists, the Party of Regions won 175 seats with 34.4 percent of the vote. In 2012, the Party of Regions won only 30 percent in proportional voting but now holds 209 seats thanks to victories in individual districts by its own nominees or by independents who joined the faction later.Under new laws that extended both the terms of Duma members and the president, Russia’s next parliamentary election is scheduled for December 2016, and would be followed by a presidential election in March 2018.Mr. Putin, in a speech to the Russian Parliament last month, described the proposed change as a continuation of liberalization efforts that began last year with an easing of restrictions on creating political parties. Critics of that process say it is now too easy to form a party, effectively splintering the opposition like a shattered pane of glass.“We had seven political parties at the beginning of this year, and now we have 48, if I am not mistaken, plus there are over 200 organizing committees working to establish their own political parties,” Mr. Putin said in the speech. “The authorities must strive to ensure that all of them enjoy equal rights.”But election experts said there were reasons to be skeptical. Arkady Lyubarev, the director of a project on developing Russian election law for Golos, the country’s only independent election monitoring group, said the organization supported a mixed voting system but not the one proposed by Mr. Putin.“We stand for a mixed linked system similar to the system of elections used for the German Bundestag,” Mr. Lyubarev said, meaning that each party would receive only as many seats as its proportion of the national vote. “But we are opposed to restoring the mixed unlinked system, which was in effect before, because it allows United Russia — and any party that has more than 30 percent support — to receive overrepresentation through victories in the single-member districts.”Mr. Lyubarev said Golos was also concerned about the possibility that independent candidates would encounter obstacles to registering their candidacies.Matthew Rojansky, the deputy director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington, suggested that Mr. Putin might have taken Ukraine as a model, particularly with the threat of the protest movement fresh in mind.“Putin is not a man to take chances, and the last year has illustrated the potential for destabilizing forces to gain momentum quickly,” he said. “The value for the party of power of the single mandate system mixed with the party list is that it can dilute the impact of a nationwide protest vote.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/world/asia/philippines-may-end-pursuit-of-marcos-wealth.html,"MANILA — A commission that has been pursuing the wealth of the former dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos should be abolished, despite the fact that much of his allegedly ill-gotten wealth has not been recovered, its chairman said on Wednesday.Andres Bautista, the chairman of the Presidential Commission on Good Government, told reporters on Wednesday that he had recommended to President Benigno S. Aquino III that the special commission be phased out.“Our recommendation was to wind down work,” said Mr. Bautista, noting that it is more efficient, and less costly for the government, if the Department of Justice handles the hunt for assets and any future cases against Marcos associates. In an earlier interview with Agence France-Presse, Mr. Bautista said, “It has become a law of diminishing returns at this point.”Mr. Marcos led the Philippines from 1965 to until 1986, when he was overthrown by the bloodless popular revolt known as People Power. He declared martial law for part of his time in office and empowered his flamboyant wife, Imelda R. Marcos, to help lead the country.Investigators have accused the Marcos family and its associates of plundering an estimated $10 billion from the Philippines while millions of Filipinos suffered in grinding poverty. In particular, Mr. Marcos’s wife was noted for extravagant displays of wealth that included lavish shopping trips to New York City with a huge entourage, spending millions on jewelry and art.But in recent years, members of the Marcos family, including Mrs. Marcos, have taken prominent political posts, complicating the commission’s efforts.The commission was created after the pro-democracy leader Corazon C. Aquino, the current president’s mother, came to power in 1986, and it was charged with the worldwide pursuit of the assets of the Marcos family and its associates.According to one analyst, the abolition of the commission will effectively end the pursuit of that wealth — much of which, by all accounts, remains unrecovered.“If a special body with extraordinary powers specifically tasked with finding the hidden wealth of Marcos cannot do it, then who else is going to?” asked Edre U. Olalia, the secretary general of the human rights organization National Union of Peoples’ Lawyers. “The government is giving up the fight.”Mr. Olalia said a special commission was still needed because the Marcos family and its associates had the resources to hire top defense lawyers who could thwart or delay government cases. He said the family was expert at hiding wealth overseas and at using influence within the government to obstruct the investigations.Mrs. Marcos, 83, is now a member of the House of Representatives, while her son, Ferdinand Marcos Jr., is a senator. Her daughter Imee Marcos is the governor of a northern province where the family is still well regarded.Former President Marcos died in exile in the United States in 1989. Some of the largest companies in the Philippines are controlled by people who were his close associates, and have been accused by investigators of helping the family plunder billions from the country.No one in the Marcos family, whose members all deny wrongdoing, has been convicted in connection with plundered wealth, nor have any associates.“The Marcos family is back in power, and they have no fear of conviction,” Mr. Olalia said. “They are prancing around with their wealth, saying they are a poor family being prosecuted by the government.”Mr. Bautista, the head of the commission, noted that the agency had recovered 164 billion pesos (about $4 billion) since its creation, including a 150-carat ruby and a diamond tiara, hundreds of millions of dollars hidden in Swiss bank accounts and prime real estate in New York City. It worked recently with New York authorities to indict Vilma Bautista, Mrs. Marcos’s former social secretary, and to recover several valuable paintings, including one from the water lily series by Claude Monet. Ms. Bautista and Mr. Bautista are not related.President Aquino and both houses of the Philippine Congress would have to agree for the commission to be abolished. On Wednesday, lawmakers disagreed about its fate.“Everybody agrees that the hunt and recovery was not going to be a walk in the park,” said Senator Francis Escudero. “But it’s disappointing that they are throwing in the towel.”But another senator, Joker Arroyo, noted that the agency had been intended from the beginning to have a limited mandate."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/politics/for-obama-fiscal-deal-is-a-victory-that-also-holds-risks.html,"WASHINGTON —  The deal significantly raises taxes on the rich, with no expiration date. It extends tax credits for the poor and the middle class. It provides more jobless benefits. Largely overlooked, it extends an alternative-energy tax credit that has helped create a clean-energy boom.And it includes almost no spending cuts.For President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress, the fiscal deal reached this week is full of small victories that further their largest policy aims. Above all, it takes another step toward Mr. Obama’s goal of orienting federal policy more toward the middle class and the poor, at the expense of the rich.Yet the deal, which the Senate and the House have passed and Mr. Obama has signed, also represents a substantial risk for the president.Throughout the negotiations of the last two months, Mr. Obama pushed for a larger agreement, one that would have canceled other looming budget deadlines, starting with one on the debt ceiling. He and his aides saw the so-called fiscal cliff, with its trillions of dollars in scheduled tax increases that Republicans abhorred, as leverage to start fresh in a second term and avoid more deadline-driven partisan fights.“I want a big deal. I want a comprehensive deal,” Mr. Obama said almost two months ago, at his first post-election news conference. “I want to see if we can, you know, at least for the foreseeable future provide certainty to businesses and the American people.”When House Republicans made it clear that they opposed a big deal, however, Mr. Obama decided to take the smaller deal, bank a series of victories and wait to fight another day. The alternative — debated inside the White House, but not ultimately a close call — would have been to go over the cliff in the hope of forcing Republicans into a larger deal.Without that larger agreement, Mr. Obama will be left to find solutions to future budget deadlines without the leverage that came with the prospect of automatic tax increases.“The best world would have been a bigger agreement,” an administration official acknowledged. “This is a big win in a second-best world.”Perhaps the best prism through which to see the Democrats’ gains is inequality. In the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama said that his top priority as president would be to “create bottom-up economic growth” and reduce inequality.He has governed as such. In the 2009 stimulus, he insisted on making tax credits “fully refundable,” so that even people who did not make enough to pay much federal tax would benefit. The 2010 health care law overhaul was probably the biggest attack on inequality since it began rising in the 1970s, increasing taxes on businesses and the rich to pay for health insurance largely for the middle class.As part of this week’s deal, Mr. Obama did make several major compromises. He accepted much less in overall tax revenue than the government would have received absent any deal. He allowed a payroll-tax cut, which applied to most households, to expire. And he yielded both on aspects of the estate tax and on the level at which the top marginal income-tax rate would start, moving it to $450,000 for couples, from $250,000.Still, using inequality as a yardstick, he won much of what he had wanted. By holding firm to a top rate of 39.6 percent — up from 35 percent — he locked in a substantial tax increase for the very richest, who have received the biggest pretax raises in recent years.On average, the top 0.1 percent of earners — whose incomes start at $2.7 million and go much higher — will pay $444,000 more in taxes in 2013 than they otherwise would have, according to the Tax Policy Center. The increases stem from both the fiscal deal and the new taxes in the health care law.In effect, the deal preserves the “compassionate conservative” part of President George W. Bush’s tax agenda — reducing federal income taxes on the working poor, sometimes to zero — while limiting the parts that most helped the affluent.Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts, R. Glenn Hubbard, now dean of Columbia Business School, did not celebrate the enshrinement of most of them. He said in an interview that the deal would amplify the tax code’s distortions on the economy.Former President Bill Clinton, by contrast, has told people that he considers the deal a good one, according to two people who have spoken to him.Beyond income tax code, the deal continued jobless benefits for two million long-term unemployed who otherwise would have lost them immediately. And it extended, for one year, an energy tax credit that has reduced alternative-energy costs and increased use.The question that hangs over the deal for Democrats is whether they will have to play defense on the budget for the rest of Mr. Obama’s presidency.When Republicans stepped back from a larger deal last month, one that would have resolved the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama faced a choice. He could have worked toward a smaller deal, as he did, or insisted that the debt ceiling had to be part of any package.White House officials took the path they did because they feared that a hardened stance on the debt ceiling would result in no deal at all: taxes would have risen on nearly everyone; automatic spending cuts would have begun; jobless benefits would have ended for many; and markets may have reacted badly.In the chaos that could have followed, the officials believed, a grand bargain would have been unlikely. If anything, Democrats — worried they would be blamed for the economy’s troubles, as the party holding the White House — might have struggled to get a deal as good as this week’s. Having won this round, Democrats still have compromises to offer Republicans in the next one, like changes to Social Security.But some of Mr. Obama’s allies wonder if he should have taken the risk of a confrontation now. A stalemate next time will bring no threat of higher taxes, and Republicans may stand firmer, demanding cuts that undo Mr. Obama’s recent gains.“I now fear that we are heading toward a crisis that can dwarf what we’ve just been through,” said Robert Greenstein, president of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “We really won’t know how best to view the deal, and how well the White House has done, until the debt limit is done.”The wait for a fuller answer will not last too long: The federal government is on pace to need a higher debt limit by March."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/us/politics/debt-deal-fails-to-allay-fears-on-us-global-power.html,"WASHINGTON — Two years ago the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, declared that “the most significant threat to our national security is our debt.” After a decade in which the nation had chased Al Qaeda and invaded Iraq, Admiral Mullen was saying, in essence, that the biggest enemy was us.Now that Congress and President Obama have slipped past the latest budget deadline with a bill that does little to address the country’s long-term debt issues — and by some measures might worsen them — the worries of the national security establishment have been reignited. Most pointedly, military and diplomatic experts wonder whether the United States is at risk of squandering its global influence.“There’s a sense that we’ve been playing roulette with our position, and this deal does nothing to stop that,” Richard N. Haass, the president of Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview. His coming book, “Foreign Policy Begins at Home,” is part of a wave of recent literature arguing that America’s reduced global ambitions are linked to its status as a debtor nation.Vali Nasr, who will soon publish “The Dispensable Nation,” argues that the debt, among other economic woes, has allowed Mr. Obama and other Democrats to justify a retreat from global engagement. “It’s made it far easier to say ‘We can’t do more,’ ” said Mr. Nasr, the dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “And without addressing the debt issues, it will be easier to make that argument for years to come.”A departing senior diplomat at the State Department who requested anonymity, ruminating on the outcome of the confrontation on the fiscal crisis, said that the failure to attack the long-term debt issues would become another reason “to turn our backs on the Middle East and trim our sails on the new focus on Asia.”That is the theme that the Chinese — who have an interest in portraying the United States as a declining power unable to manage its economy — are already promoting. “The politicians have chosen to kick the can down the road,” the state-run Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Wednesday. “The can will never disappear,” it continued, warning that the United States was falling “into an abyss you can never come out of.”Most evidence suggests that the country’s debt is not an immediate crisis. The deficit is expected to shrink somewhat in coming years, and even after the United States lost its AAA bond rating, foreigners have remained willing to lend the country money at very low interest rates. That is a sign of confidence in the American economy and a recognition that Europe and Asia have problems of their own.But the aging of the population and the growth of health costs will most likely cause the deficit to grow rapidly in coming decades, meaning that the most difficult choices about taxes and spending are still ahead. Absent decisions on those issues, the government will have fewer resources and be more dependent on foreign lenders — increasingly the Chinese.“Partly it is about resources,” Mr. Haass said, referring to the national security implications of the deficit. “But it is also about reducing your vulnerability to the machinations of currency markets and potentially hostile central bankers” who choose whether to buy American debt.“When we appear to be dysfunctional, as we have in recent times, it makes it hard to be the model for the democratic, capitalistic model we say we want to be in the world,” he added.History suggests that the relationship between debt and American power is a complex one, subject to differing interpretations by both economists and historians. The federal debt exceeded 100 percent of the gross domestic product at the end of World War II, but the postwar period nonetheless marked the beginning of America’s superpower status. The debt fell fairly steadily during the cold war, and it was cut to about a third of gross domestic product by the end of the Nixon administration — even as the country retreated into a post-Vietnam War funk.On the flip side, the era now regarded as America’s “unipower moment” — the Clinton years of the mid-1990s — was also a time when the government was significantly reducing debt.But historians point out that other factors besides debt have often driven the perception of American power. The growth of the American manufacturing behemoth in the ’50s and ’60s helped drive the nation’s rise. So much seemed at stake in the cold war that most Western countries waited for Washington to act first, regardless of its postwar deficit. In the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States as the only player with global reach — and made it easier to cut defense budgets, suggesting that power drove deficits more than the reverse.Today, the United States lacks many of those earlier advantages. With economic growth harder to come by, the only obvious way to make major cuts in the budget is to go after Social Security, Medicare and the $1 trillion national security budget — which includes the military, intelligence, diplomacy and development. And whenever the United States decides not to engage in some part of the world, countries look to a new source of investment and aid: China.That is certainly happening in countries that are waiting for the promised “Arab Spring fund” to aid emerging democracies.“Morsi has played this very smart, asking the Chinese whether they are willing to invest in Egypt the way they have in Kenya or Uganda,” Mr. Nasr said, referring to Egypt’s president, Mohamed Morsi.“What’s happened is that we’ve been able to hide behind the economic argument to justify why we are no longer the venture capitalist of democracy,” added Mr. Nasr, who worked for Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan early in the Obama administration who died in 2010.When Mr. Obama came to office, no one made the argument about focusing on the domestic sources of American power more than the new president. He used that as an argument for ending America’s military presence in Iraq and moving to the exits in Afghanistan. “Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power,” Mr. Obama said in 2009. “It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy.”In the presidential campaign last year, he pushed back at arguments about long-term American decline. Since his re-election, his aides have as well, arguing that the restoration of growth, though slow, and exploitation of new sources of American oil and gas have set the stage for a revival over the next four years."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/us/illinois-gay-marriage-bill-is-sent-to-senate.html,"Same-sex marriage cleared a first hurdle to becoming law in Illinois after the Senate Executive Committee passed the legislation Thursday, sending it to the full Senate. It was not clear when a vote would take place there. If the measure becomes law, Illinois would become the 10th state to approve same-sex marriage. Advocates are pushing for full gay marriage rights just 18 months after the state recognized civil unions. Many faith organizations are opposed on religious freedom grounds, arguing that the proposal would compel them to treat same-sex unions as the equivalent of traditional marriage."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/communications-satellites-banned-as-weapons-now-legal-for-export.html,"To the delight of American satellite makers, communications satellites — which orbit Earth to relay phone calls, link ships to shore and broadcast television programs — will become legal for civilian export under legislation that President Obama signed into law on Thursday.Although the United States founded the industry, manufacturers were forced to pull back from international markets after a 1999 law categorized the satellites as weapons and restricted their export. At the time, Congress was fearful that selling satellites abroad could allow technology secrets to fall into the wrong hands.The defense bill that President Obama signed will undo that step and let American companies sell communications satellites as civilian technology rather than as deadly arms. Among the beneficiaries will be companies like Boeing, Hughes and Space Systems/Loral.“This is a tremendous assist for an industry that is inherently international,” said Patricia A. Cooper, president of the Satellite Industry Association, a business group in Washington. “It will ensure our place at the forefront of space.”As a practical matter, communications satellites made their debut in 1964 and quickly became stars of the space age. The first craft, orbiting at 22,300 miles, relayed signals to the United States from Japan that let American television viewers watch live coverage of the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo.But the industry stumbled 13 years ago after Republicans in Congress pressed for a law that restricted communications satellite exports. The lawmakers praised it as a security precaution that would prevent China and other perceived foes from stealing technology secrets. Detractors saw it as a cynical ploy meant to discredit the Clinton administration and its policy of Chinese engagement.That law put communications satellites on Washington’s list of export-controlled munitions: tools of war like tanks, bombs, missiles and equipment for making nuclear arms. Foreign companies took the opportunity to increase their satellite sales.The new law gives Mr. Obama the authority to return communications satellites to their previous status as civilian technology. It retains provisions that restrict the export of satellites to nations like China and North Korea, and to sponsors of state terrorism like Iran.Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, who introduced a bill to change the policy on satellite exports and whose state is a space industry hub, said the measure offered satellite manufacturers a crucial lift.“Companies across the country have been operating at a disadvantage due to these policies,” he said in a statement. “These reforms will give our businesses a chance to compete globally while still protecting our national security interests.”The strict export controls arose from a political fight over satellite launchings by China, which in the 1980s began offering cheap rides into orbit on low-cost rockets. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, both Republicans, approved transfers of American spacecraft to Chinese rockets, as did President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.Starting in early 1998, a series of upsets brought the expanding trade to a halt. Two American satellite makers involved in the Chinese launchings, Hughes and Loral, were accused of giving China advice about making not only commercial rockets, but also military missiles.Republicans, who controlled Congress at the time, argued that satellite exports could lead to a hemorrhage of secret materials and information, and said that China might already have stolen encryption secrets.After the strict export rules took effect in 1999, the legal complications involved in selling communications satellites and components abroad contributed to a sharp decline in the American share of the market, from a dominating position to about 50 percent today.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama said the rules had “unduly hampered the competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry” and vowed to push for change.Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, who for a decade helped lead the movement for change, said its culmination as law would help restore the nation’s competitiveness in the global satellite market.“Treating commercial satellites and components as if they were lethal weapons, regardless of whether they’re going to friend or foe, has gravely harmed U.S. space manufacturers,” he said.Mr. Berman added that the benefits extended beyond the manufacturers. The national security establishment relies on the companies and their technological skills to fulfill the government’s satellite needs and to develop spacecraft involved in a wide range of military missions.“If they can’t compete in the international marketplace,” he said of the companies, “they can’t innovate and cannot survive.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/energy-environment/congress-extends-incentives-for-biodiesel-industry.html,"The Congressional budget deal brokered this week kept tax breaks in place for a variety of industries, but biodiesel got something even better: a retroactive reinstatement of a dollar-a-gallon credit going back to January 2012, when it lapsed.The retroactive portion of the credit, which will run through the end of 2013, represents a benefit to the blenders of about $1 billion. And the $1 per gallon of biodiesel amounts to roughly one-quarter of the fuel’s current wholesale price.With the credit in place, production will be about 1.6 billion gallons this year, estimated Ben Evans, a spokesman for the National Biodiesel Board, a trade association. Without the credit, the industry would have sold only 1.3 billion gallons, he said.Since a retroactive credit cannot influence behavior, its main effect will be to encourage blenders that produced biodiesel last year to invest more in infrastructure, Mr. Evans said. Had it been in place a year ago, he said, about 300 million more gallons would have been produced.Any increase in biodiesel production typically draws criticism from environmentalists and others who warn that it will cut into food production. Soybeans make up about 50 percent of the mix, with the rest coming from animal fats, cooking grease and other sources.The fuel itself is usually sold in a blend of 5 to 20 percent biodiesel, with the remainder consisting of petroleum diesel.A year after Congress eliminated two major subsidies for corn-based ethanol, the market has still not absorbed all the ethanol available. So the budget deal also extends tax credits to help gas stations invest in selling a blend of 85 percent ethanol, or E85, or less.The package allows a credit of up to $100,000 per filling station. The problem is that there were few takers for a similar credit that was in place last year.Only 3,000 of the 165,000 gas stations in the United States are equipped to sell ethanol blends higher than 10 percent. And at current prices, the millions of cars now capable of using E85 can cover more miles on E10, a blend that is 10 percent ethanol, for the same price.With the price of a gallon of ethanol now below the price of a gallon of conventional gasoline, oil companies have incentives to use the material as a fuel supplement regardless of tax policy. And the industry still benefits from a quota that the federal government imposes on the oil industry to use ethanol and other bio-based fuels.But the incentive for consumers remains weak because a gallon of ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as a gallon of conventional gasoline.For years, experts said that introducing new fuels created a chicken-and-egg problem; nobody would sell the fuel until plenty of vehicles could use it, and nobody would buy the vehicles until filling stations sold it. Yet now there are vehicles and fuel, but few gas stations.Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the chicken-and-egg analogy was no longer appropriate. “Maybe we get the egg but not the yolk,” he joked. “We do have the fuel, and the vehicles — we don’t have access to the pump.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/opinion/global/100-75-50-years-ago.html,"1913 Autocab Strike in London ContinuesLONDON  —  No matter which side is victorious in the autocab strike, which continues to seriously hinder travel in London, for once it is unlikely that the public will have to pay. A suggestion that the difficulty might be settled by an increase in the fares has been scouted as impossible. Mr. Fred Hill, the general secretary of the men’s union, in an interview published in the “Standard” said yesterday [Jan. 3]: “We are dead against any increase in the fares at all.” Several firms not connected with the Motor-Cab Proprietors’ Association have conceded the demands of the men and a few more cabs were plying for hire, but the position shows no substantial improvement.1938 London Cheers Roosevelt Speech LONDON  —  President Roosevelt’s message to Congress received an interested and often enthusiastic reception tonight [Jan. 3], as late newspaper reports and radio relays made its contents known. While no official comment has yet been circulated, there are sufficient indications of acceptance for those portions of the message dealing with foreign affairs. Its references to the domestic situation are rather outside the scope of general discussion, but its indictment of anti-democratic forces and its restatement of the President’s faith in the future of democracy have been hailed both for their actual and their symbolic value by some British observers.1963 A Plea For Help At U.S. EmbassyMOSCOW  —  A group of 32 Russians describing themselves as “Evangelical Christians” took refuge in the United States Embassy here today [Jan. 3] in a desperate search for a “promised land” free of religious persecution. Four hours later, protesting that they would be shot, imprisoned or separated from their children, they were taken by Soviet officials to an unknown destination. The group — peasants from the Siberian town of Chernogorsk — consisted of six men, 12 women and 14 children. They told embassy officials they had spent four days traveling 2,100 miles from their homes to Moscow in hopes of reaching “Israel.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/huggies-pull-ups-ad-campaign-aims-to-celebrate-toilet-training.html,"FOR parents, milestones worthy of commemoration in a young child’s life can include the loss of a first tooth or the first trip to the barbershop. Training a child to use the toilet, however, is often met with much less enthusiasm.To market its Huggies Pull-Ups training pants for toddlers, the Kimberly-Clark Corporation has opted for an advertising campaign that focuses on celebrating that first flush with fanfare in the hope of making the potty training process more enjoyable for parents and their children.“Moms don’t look forward to potty training,” said Pete Sawin, the brand director for Pull-Ups at Kimberly-Clark. “Many of them procrastinate and put it off. They start training well after their kids are ready to.”Parents, Mr. Sawin said, are “seeking more milestone moments to celebrate.” The goal of the campaign, he said, is to make the training process “easy and fun” while introducing children to the ritual that is using the toilet.Kimberly-Clark worked with a number of agencies, including Organic for digital ads and a mobile application, Ogilvy & Mather for print and television ads and LatinWorks for a Spanish-language portion of the campaign.For a television ad for English-speaking mothers, Ogilvy cast a family with a child who was about to go through toilet training, not actors, said Dave Metcalf, group creative director at Ogilvy. The ad, which was shot in Vancouver, features a toddler who flushes the toilet at his parents’ encouragement and then hears a commotion outside the house.The family opens the front door and sees a parade celebrating the child’s first flush, replete with floats, acrobats and a marching band. The family was not told about the parade, Mr. Metcalf said, so their reactions of surprise were genuine. For production reasons, however, the home where the ad was shot was not the family’s real home. A second video showing the making of the commercial, including snippets from the casting call for the performers and the family, will be posted online.To further engage children and their parents in toilet training, a mobile application called the Pull-Ups Big Kid App includes a timer for parents to remind their children when to use the toilet, articles and tips about training, videos, celebratory songs, calls from Disney characters like Rapunzel and Mickey Mouse and a reward system that gives a child a star for every attempt at using the toilet. Once a child has gotten a certain number of stars, the app offers 3-D games that can be played on a tablet or mobile phone.Ian Bell, head of home care research at Euromonitor, a market research company, said campaigns like this one were meant to make the process of toilet training “more accessible and less threatening” for parents who may be overwhelmed by information guides on the topic and by cultural pressures about how and when to begin the process. “Some parents would frown if it takes to the age of 3 or above,” Mr. Bell said. “Others think you shouldn’t push it on a child.”Cultural nuance is part of the Spanish-language portion of the campaign, said Victor Paredes, vice president at LatinWorks, the agency that worked on that portion. “If one in four kids is Hispanic, that’s not a business opportunity, that’s a business imperative,” he said of the recent growth in the number of Latino children in the United States.The agency found that in non-Hispanic households, parents were struggling to start the process of toilet training, but that in Hispanic households, the issues were different.“In the Latina’s world, the pressure came with sticking to the process,” Mr. Paredes said. “They had some preconceived notions of the process needing to be fast and the gold standard was transitioning to regular underwear, and not understanding the transition that happens.”Hispanic mothers are likely to be younger and to have larger families than non-Hispanic mothers, he said. More of them are entering the work force and becoming heads of households as well, he said, limiting the time many of them can dedicate to toilet training their children.While the ads for Hispanic and non-Hispanic mothers will be similar, the ads for Hispanic mothers will focus on “every flush” rather than on the “first flush.”Television ads in English began running Jan. 1 on networks like Nickelodeon and the Disney Channel. Digital ads in English will run on Web sites like Facebook and BabyCenter.com, and print ads will run in parenting magazines. Spanish-language ads will begin in February and will run on Univision’s broadcast network, on Web sites like Mamás Latinas and Batanga and in print publications like Siempre Mujer and Vanidades.According to Mr. Bell of Euromonitor, sales of toilet training pants in the United States, including Huggies Pull-Ups and other brands, have struggled since the recession. From 2008 to 2012, sales for all manufacturers making training pants fell $150 million, with some parents opting to save money by using cheaper diapers, he said.Kimberly-Clark said it would spend 43 percent of the advertising budget for its Pull-Ups product on the campaign, but declined to specify what the budget for 2013 would be. Data from Kantar Media, a unit of WPP, show that the company spent $13.5 million advertising Pull-Ups in 2010 and $17 million in 2011. From January to September 2012, it spent $22.1 million advertising Pull-Ups."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/lessons-from-european-brinkmanship.html,"Will the United States follow the European path in 2013?Let’s hope so.A year ago, the world’s markets were watching Europe with rising fear. Some expected 2012 to be the year that the euro zone broke up. Germany did not want to pay to bail out its less fortunate neighbors unless they agreed to severe austerity and to what amounted to a surrender of sovereignty — ideas that other countries were loath to accept.What ensued during the year was a series of summit meetings that often seemed to do more for the hotel business in assorted European capitals than they did to solve the problem. Agreements in principle were announced, sending markets up, only to stumble back when the details got difficult.What the naysayers missed was that there really was a common commitment to save the euro, and that in the end politicians and central bankers would do what was needed to avert disaster. Finally, in July, the European Central Bank came up with a plan that assured the euro area banks, and the troubled governments, that they would have access to money at reasonable rates. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, went along, angering some of her German colleagues, who thought she was straying from basic principles.So it could be in the United States Congress. The outgoing Congress went up to the final minutes, amid much angst, before it averted the fiscal crisis. There are reasons to grumble about the details, and more deadlines loom in the new Congress, but the essential point was that in the end the House Republicans allowed a bill to pass even though a majority of them opposed it.John A. Boehner, the speaker who has often seemed scared to do anything that his Tea Party colleagues might oppose, not only allowed the vote but chose to vote for the proposal. The first indication of whether this is a new dawn, or simply a case of the House Republicans being outmaneuvered, could come when the debt ceiling is addressed. Logically, the debt ceiling is an absurd vote to begin with. Raising it simply allows the government to pay the bills for spending the Congress already approved. To allow the spending bills to pass, but to then refuse to raise the debt ceiling, is equivalent to a family’s deciding to refuse to pay the credit card bill while continuing to spend. That will only accomplish destruction of the family’s credit.Perhaps some Republicans will threaten to keep the country from paying its bills to accomplish something they don’t otherwise have the votes to accomplish. But if the European precedent holds, the final result will at least avert disaster.Whether more than that can be hoped for may depend in part on whether those screaming for major cuts in federal spending actually believe their rhetoric — the talk about the United States becoming another Greece.The reality is that the current budget deficit largely reflects two things: exceptionally low government revenue and the continuing problems caused by the financial crisis and recession that followed the bursting of the housing bubble. Bringing tax revenue back to historical levels, as well as the growth in revenue and reductions in spending that will automatically follow an improving economy, will make a major difference.There are issues that must be addressed regarding health care costs and Medicare, as well as the fact that there will be fewer workers for each retiree as the baby boomers retire. But those who see a Greek-type crisis here should ask themselves why the government can borrow at interest rates that remain extraordinarily low. The world’s trust in Uncle Sam’s ability to pay its debts has remained high.What are not high are taxes, although a poll would no doubt show that many people think otherwise.Federal taxes, relative to the size of the economy, are significantly lower than they were after Ronald Reagan cut them. During 2012 federal revenue amounted to around 17 percent of gross domestic product. At the Reagan low point, the figure was a full percentage point higher. In 2009, when the deficit was ballooning, the figure fell below 16 percent, something that had happened only once during the more than 60 years for which comparable data is available.Back in 2000, federal revenue approached 21 percent of G.D.P. The assumption that such strong collections would continue played a major role in the forecasts of budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. In 2001, aides to President George W. Bush pointed to the figure as proof that Americans were overtaxed. It turned out that tax revenue figures were temporarily inflated in two ways by the bull market in technology stocks. Not only were there a lot of capital gains to be taxed, but soaring share prices also produced a lot of ordinary income for those employees and executives who could cash in stock options.At the time, it was assumed that such options had no significant impact on tax revenue, because the income that went to the employee provided an offsetting tax deduction for the company that issued the options. That might have been true had the companies been paying taxes, but many of the most bubbly stocks were in companies that never had, and never would, pay a dollar in income taxes.That revenue would have come down sharply after the technology stock bubble burst, even without the Bush tax cuts. But those tax cuts worsened the situation and are a major cause of the current deficits.It might be interesting to consider what would have happened in the 2012 presidential campaign had either candidate been willing to, as Adlai Stevenson once said, “talk sense to the American people.”In reality, neither candidate would have dreamed of saying, as an economist did a week ago: “Ultimately, unless we scale back entitlement programs far more than anyone in Washington is now seriously considering, we will have no choice but to increase taxes on a vast majority of Americans. This could involve higher tax rates or an elimination of popular deductions. Or it could mean an entirely new tax, such as a value-added tax or a carbon tax.”It would have been only a little more likely to hear a candidate say, as another economist said after the fiscal deal was reached, “We need a tax system that can promote economic growth and raise the revenue the American people want to devote to government.”The first quote came from a column in The New York Times by N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. The second statement was made W. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia University business school, who was chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers when the Bush tax cuts were enacted. He went on to say, a Times article reported, that some Bush-era policies were no longer relevant to the task of tailoring a tax code to a properly sized government.Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Hubbard were among the top economic advisers to Mr. Romney. If they advised him to make similar statements during the campaign, he did not take the advice.“Fiscal negotiations might become a bit easier if everyone started by agreeing that the policies we choose must be constrained by the laws of arithmetic,” Mr. Mankiw added."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/us/first-day-of-113th-congress-brings-more-women-to-capitol.html,"WASHINGTON — As the 113th Congress opens, the Senate and the House are starting to look a little bit more like the people they represent. The new Congress includes a record number of women (101 across both chambers, counting three nonvoting members), as well as various firsts for the numbers of Latinos and Asians as well as Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans. But it was the rise of the female legislator — 20 in the Senate and 81 in the House — that had the Capitol thrumming with excited potential on Thursday.The first serious display of XX-chromosome strength occurred well before noon, when the female members of the House Democratic Caucus gathered on the Capitol steps for a group photo. With many of the women dressed in vibrant hues, they assembled in the chilly January air, waving to old friends and greeting the new. They laughed and joked, inviting Representative Barney Frank, the Democrat from Massachusetts who retired this week, to hop in the picture. (He politely demurred.) A young aide to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic minority leader from California, scurried to grab some of the members’ coats, juggling the fur and wool in his left hand while trying to snap iPhone photos with his right.“Here comes Rosa! Here comes Rosa!” the women cheered, referring to Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut, who came jogging up from the left side moments before the photo was taken.“I think women bring a slightly different perspective,” said Representative Tammy Duckworth, Democrat of Illinois, who is one of the first female combat veterans elected to Congress, as is Representative Tulsi Gabbard, Democrat of Hawaii. “The women, I think, are going to reach across the aisle a lot more. We’re a lot more pragmatic, but we do come from all different backgrounds.”This Congress promises to be more diverse than its predecessors in several ways. On hand at the Capitol were Tammy Baldwin, Democrat of Wisconsin, the first openly gay senator; the first Hindu representative, Ms. Gabbard; and Mazie Hirono, Democrat of Hawaii, the first Buddhist senator. Representative Kyrsten Sinema, Democrat of Arizona. also became the first openly bisexual member to serve in Congress.Although the number of black legislators remained at 43, Tim Scott, previously a Republican House member from South Carolina, became the first black senator from his state, as well as the first black Republican in the Senate since 1979.After she was sworn in for her second term, Senator Claire McCaskill, the Missouri Democrat, said women were making progress in the Senate. “I don’t think we should be satisfied until we have the same number of women in the Senate that represent the percentage of the population that are women, so we still have a long way to go,” she said.The day began on a touching note, when Senator Mark Steven Kirk, the Illinois Republican who was returning to Congress after a stroke last January, climbed the steps to the Senate chamber with the help of a cane and the moral support of his colleagues. He was met by the Illinois delegation, most of the Senate, and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who greeted him with a hug. Mr. Kirk may also have some explaining to do to Representative Paul D. Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican and vice-presidential rival to Mr. Biden, after Mr. Kirk told the vice president, “It was a good debate. I was rooting for you.”When Mr. Kirk, his face contorted in concentration, slowed near the top of the steps, his colleagues called out “Almost there!” and “A few more!” and then erupted in applause when he reached the landing, triumphant.On the House side, the first day was filled with familiar ritual — the children romping in the well of the House, the speaker’s roll call vote — but there were also some sweet notes.Representative Dave Camp, the Michigan Republican who is recovering from treatment for non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, sat in the chamber with his children beside him. Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington wandered the aisles with her daughter on her hip.The opening of the 113th Congress had a decidedly first day of school feeling, with many of the members flanked by proud parents, as well as children of their own. Some freshman members wandered around, half awe-struck and half bewildered, and many aides did not yet have business cards.“We just moved in,” they said apologetically, over and over.As the afternoon darkened to evening, House members lined up to have their mock swearing-in picture taken with John A. Boehner of Ohio, narrowly and newly re-elected speaker of the House. Representative Andy Barr, a freshman Republican from Kentucky, stood with his wife, Carol, and their 21-month-old daughter, Eleanor, whom Mr. Boehner kissed on the cheek. Eleanor promptly wiped it away.“Oh, she’s a big fan of the speaker,” Mr. Barr said later. “She just hasn’t had a nap today!”Representative Joe Kennedy III, a Massachusetts Democrat and the newest elected member of the Kennedy clan, was fending off rumors that he had higher office on his mind on his first day in the House. After Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, who will vacate his Senate seat if he is confirmed as President Obama’s next secretary of state, pulled Mr. Kennedy aside for a chat, a reporter jokingly asked if Mr. Kennedy was considering a run for Mr. Kerry’s seat.“I’m definitely not, so let’s get that as the very first thing,” Mr. Kennedy replied, with a laugh. “I’m very happy where I am right now.”Over at the member photo check-in table, aides were offering lessons in Congress 101: Remember, they warned, when you go before cameras to have your picture taken with Mr. Boehner, be careful what you say.The microphones will pick everything up, and members would be well advised to avoid a gaffe on opening day. There will be plenty of time for that later."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/us/in-texas-legislative-session-lawmaking-disrupts-politics.html,"Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.The Texas Legislature’s biennial 20-week session will start on Tuesday, and it feels upside down, as if governing the state is an interruption of the normal business of politics.Think of it this way: legislators govern for 140 of every 730 or 731 days (leap years) and spend the rest of the time running for office.Somewhere along the line, elections expanded to fill all of the space between sessions. Sometimes, they bust even those barriers. Talk of the 2014 races —  of whether Gov. Rick Perry will run again, and what follows that, and who, and so on — was under way in Austin before the 2012 election had been held.At the risk of sounding provincial, we in the provinces like to blame Washington for the current climate, where politics trumps everything.The Legislature last met in 2011, on the heels of an election that matched Mr. Perry against United States Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a fellow Republican, and then against former Mayor Bill White of Houston, a Democrat. It was a humdinger, and it ate the better part of a year. Mr. Perry went on a national book tour after his re-election — and before the session — and talk of his possible run for president became the order of the day.That conversation and a tug of war over a tight budget dominated the five-month session. Once lawmakers left, the presidential primaries and caucuses (and Mr. Perry’s presidential campaign), as well as redistricting, Senate elections, summer runoffs and November elections, gobbled up the squares on the calendar.It’s hard to find fault with a citizen who can’t remember the legislative session wedged into that schedule.In civics textbooks, governing is the thing. Politics is in there, certainly, but the elections have a beginning and an end. The Legislature meets every two years for 140 days. A period of civic peace and prosperity follows for six or seven months. Birds sing. The sun shines. Children play. Late in the year, candidates file for March primaries. When that’s over, another period of relative calm falls on Texas, ending around Labor Day, when candidates fire up their general election campaigns. The November elections start the cycle all over again, regular as weather.Back here in real life, the elections never stop. Neither does the electioneering. It’s a two-year political season, interrupted by five months of fierce legislating — a bit of which has as much to do with politics and elections as with governing the state.The interruption started last month, with the beginning of a legal ban on campaign contributions during a legislative session, and runs until June. Elected state officials can’t really campaign, and they must cross a parliamentary minefield, knowing that what happens between now and Memorial Day — the end of the session — could bite them in 2014, when the next elections take place.Once the session starts next week and the politics of the speaker’s race ends, the politicos become lawmakers.The Pollyannaish civics books are right, in part: the real consequences come during the governing part that starts next week. Everything else is just the fight to get into the building.The candidates make their promises and then come to Austin to act on what the voters told them. And when they’re in Austin, they try to set up issues and votes in a way that hobbles their political enemies and buys some advantage for them and their friends in the elections.To the lawmakers, the news media, the activists and others who complete the legislative circus, the political fight is often a lot more interesting than the policy details. That’s another thing about this respite from elections: boring or not, the policy details rise to the top. The weird ideas from the various campaigns stop being theoretical. Some of them become the rules we all have to follow, whether we voted or not.It’s hard to distinguish which season is preparation and which is performance. The election is the long season, when ambitious people noisily and expensively apply for jobs in Austin. The short season that starts on Tuesday is when we find out if we hired the right ones.And then it starts all over again. The governor and the attorney general were recently asked at a news conference what they’ll do in 2014. The answer? They said they’ll reveal their plans in June."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/americas/after-years-in-solitary-an-austere-life-as-uruguays-president.html,"MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — Some world leaders live in palaces. Some enjoy perks like having a discreet butler, a fleet of yachts or a wine cellar with vintage Champagnes. Then there is José Mujica, the former guerrilla who is Uruguay’s president. He lives in a run-down house on Montevideo’s outskirts with no servants at all. His security detail: two plainclothes officers parked on a dirt road.In a deliberate statement to this cattle-exporting nation of 3.3 million people, Mr. Mujica, 77, shunned the opulent Suárez y Reyes presidential mansion, with its staff of 42, remaining instead in the home where he and his wife have lived for years, on a plot of land where they grow chrysanthemums for sale in local markets.Visitors reach Mr. Mujica’s austere dwelling after driving down O’Higgins Road, past groves of lemon trees. His net worth upon taking office in 2010 amounted to about $1,800 — the value of the 1987 Volkswagen Beetle parked in his garage. He never wears a tie and donates about 90 percent of his salary, largely to a program for expanding housing for the poor.His current brand of low-key radicalism — a marked shift from his days wielding weapons in an effort to overthrow the government — exemplifies Uruguay’s emergence as arguably Latin America’s most socially liberal country.Under Mr. Mujica, who took office in 2010, Uruguay has drawn attention for seeking to legalize marijuana and same-sex marriage, while also enacting one of the region’s most sweeping abortion rights laws and sharply boosting the use of renewable energy sources like wind and biomass.As illness drives President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela from the political stage, suddenly leaving the continent without the larger-than-life figure who has held such sway on the left, Mr. Mujica’s practiced asceticism is a study in contrasts. For democracy to function properly, he argues, elected leaders should be taken down a notch.“We have done everything possible to make the presidency less venerated,” Mr. Mujica said in an interview one recent morning, after preparing a serving in his kitchen of mate, the herbal drink offered in a hollowed calabash gourd and commonly shared in dozens of sips through the same metal straw.Passing around the gourd, he acknowledged that his laid-back presidential lifestyle might seem unusual. Still, he said it amounted to a conscious choice to forgo the trappings of power and wealth. Quoting the Roman court-philosopher Seneca, Mr. Mujica said, “It is not the man who has too little, but the man who craves more, who is poor.”THE leader at the helm of Uruguay’s changes, known to his many detractors and supporters alike as Pepe, is someone few thought could ever rise to such a position. Before Mr. Mujica became a gardener of chrysanthemums, he was a leader of the Tupamaros, the urban guerrilla group that drew inspiration from the Cuban revolution, carrying out armed bank robberies and kidnappings on Montevideo’s streets.In their war against the Uruguayan state, the Tupamaros gained notoriety through violence. The filmmaker Constantin Costa-Gavras drew inspiration for his 1972 movie, “State of Siege,” from their abduction and execution in 1970 of Daniel Mitrione, an American adviser to Uruguay’s security forces. Mr. Mujica has said that the group “tried by all means to avoid killings,” but he has also euphemistically acknowledged its “military deviations.”A brutal counterinsurgency subdued the Tupamaros, and the police captured Mr. Mujica in 1972. He spent 14 years in prison, including more than a decade in solitary confinement, often in a hole in the ground. During that time, he would go more than a year without bathing, and his companions, he said, were a tiny frog and rats with whom he shared crumbs of bread.Some of the other Tupamaros who were placed for years in solitary confinement failed to grasp the benefits of befriending rodents. One of them, Henry Engler, a medical student, underwent a severe mental breakdown before his release in 1985.Mr. Mujica rarely speaks about his time in prison. Seated at a table in his garden, sipping his mate, he said it gave him time to reflect. “I learned that one can always start again,” he said.He chose to start again by entering politics. Elected as a legislator, he shocked the parking attendants at Parliament by arriving on a Vespa. After the rise to power in 2004 of the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist parties and more centrist social democrats, he was named minister of Livestock, Agriculture and Fisheries.Before Mr. Mujica won the 2009 election by a wide margin, his opponent, Luis Alberto Lacalle, disparaged his small house here as a “cave.” After that, Mr. Mujica also upset some in Uruguay’s political establishment by selling off a presidential residence in a seaside resort city, calling the property “useless.”His donations leave him with roughly $800 a month of his salary. He said he and his wife, Lucía Topolansky, a former guerrilla who was also imprisoned and is now a senator, do not need much to live on. In a new declaration in 2012, Mr. Mujica said he was sharing ownership of assets previously in his wife’s name, including their home and farm equipment, which lifted his net worth.He pointed out that his Broad Front predecessor as president, Tabaré Vázquez, also stayed in his own home (though Mr. Vázquez, an oncologist, lives in the well-heeled district of El Prado), and that José Batlle y Ordóñez, a president in the early 20th century who created Uruguay’s welfare state, helped forge a tradition in which there is “no distance between the president and any neighbor.”INDEED, if there is any country in South America where a president can drive a Beetle and get by without a large entourage of bodyguards, it might be Uruguay, which consistently ranks among the region’s least corrupt and least unequal nations. While crime is emerging as more of a concern, Uruguay remains a contender for the region’s safest country.Still, Mr. Mujica’s governing style does not sit well with everyone. The proposal to legalize marijuana, in particular, has incited a fierce debate, with polls showing most Uruguayans opposed to the measure. In December, Mr. Mujica asked legislators to postpone voting to regulate the marijuana market, though he is pushing for the bill to be discussed again soon.“It’s a shame to have a president like this man,” said Luz Díaz, 78, a retired maid who lives near Mr. Mujica and voted for him in 2009. She said she would not do so again if given the choice. “This marijuana thing, it’s absurd,” she added. “Pepe should return to selling flowers.”Polls show that his approval ratings have been declining, but “I don’t give a damn,” insisted Mr. Mujica, emphasizing that he considered re-election to consecutive terms, already prohibited by Uruguay’s Constitution, as “monarchic.” “If I worried about pollsters, I wouldn’t be president,” he said.With two years remaining in his term, Mr. Mujica seems to cherish the freedom to speak his mind. About his religious beliefs, he said he was still searching for God.He laments that so many societies considered economic growth a priority, calling this “a problem for our civilization” because of the demands on the planet’s resources. (Interestingly enough, Uruguay’s economy is still expanding comfortably at an estimated annual rate of 3.6 percent.)When the gourd of mate was empty, Mr. Mujica disappeared into his kitchen and returned with an impish grin and a bottle of Espinillar, a Uruguayan tipple distilled from sugarcane. It was not yet noon, but glasses were filled and toasts were pronounced.After that, the president jumped around subjects, from anthropology and cycling to Uruguayans’ love for beef. He said he could not dream of retiring, but looked forward to his post-presidency, when he hopes to farm full time again.Finally, Mr. Mujica’s eyes lit up as he remembered a passage from “Don Quixote,” in which the knight-errant imbibes wine from a horn and dines on salted goat with his goatherd hosts, delivering a harangue against the “pestilence of gallantry.”“The goatherds were the poorest people of Spain,” said Mr. Mujica. “Probably,” he added, “they were the richest.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/business/after-fiscal-deal-tax-code-may-be-most-progressive-since-1979.html,"WASHINGTON — With 2013 bringing tax increases on the incomes of a small sliver of the richest Americans, the country’s top earners now face a heavier tax burden than at any time since Jimmy Carter was president.The last-minute deal struck by the departing 112th Congress raised taxes on a handful of the highest-earning Americans, with about 99.3 percent of households experiencing no change in their income taxes. But the Tax Policy Center estimates that the average family in the top 1 percent will pay a federal tax rate of more than 36 percent this year, up from 28 percent in 2008. That is the highest rate since 1979, at least.By some measures, the tax code might now be the most progressive in a generation, tax economists said, while noting that every American is paying a lower burden currently than they did then. In fact, the total federal tax rate is still vastly lower for the very rich than it was at any point in the 1940s through 1970s. It has risen from historical lows, but is still closer to those lows than where it was in the postwar decades.“We made the system more progressive by raising rates at the top and leaving them for everyone else,” said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a research group based in Washington. “The offsetting issue is that the rich have gotten a lot richer.”Indeed, over the last three decades the bulk of pretax income gains have gone to the wealthy — and the higher up on the income scale, the bigger the gains, with billionaires outpacing millionaires who outpaced the merely rich. Economists doubted that the tax increases would do much to reverse that trend.With the recovery failing to improve incomes for millions of average Americans and the country running trillion-dollar deficits, President Obama made “tax fairness” a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. In the heated negotiations with House Speaker John A. Boehner, that translated into the White House’s insistence on tax increases for the top 2 percent of households and a continuation of tax breaks and cuts for a vast number of taxpayers.Republicans resisted increasing tax rates and aimed for lower revenue targets, arguing that spending was the budget’s primary problem and that no American should see his or her taxes go up too much in such a sluggish economy. But ultimately they relented, and Congress cut a last-minute deal.“A central promise of my campaign for president was to change the tax code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working middle-class Americans,” Mr. Obama said after Congress reached an agreement.That deal includes a host of tax increases on the rich. It raises the tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on income above $400,000 for individuals, and $450,000 for couples. The rate on dividends and capital gains for those same taxpayers was bumped up 5 percentage points, to 20 percent. Congress also reinstated limits on the amount households with more than $300,000 in income can deduct. On top of that, two new surcharges — a 3.8 percent tax on investment income and a 0.9 percent tax on regular income — hit those same wealthy households.As a result of the taxes added in both the deal and the 2010 health care law, which came into effect this year, taxpayers with $1 million in income and up will pay on average $168,000 more in taxes. Millionaires’ share of the overall federal tax burden will climb to 23 percent from 20 percent.The result is a tax code that squeezes hundreds of billions of dollars more from the very well off — about $600 billion more over 10 years — while leaving the tax burden on everyone else mostly as it was. And the changes come after 30 years of both Republican and Democratic administrations doing the converse: zeroing out federal income taxes for many poor working families while also reducing the tax burden for households on the higher end of the income scale.“Back at the end of the Carter and beginning of the Reagan administrations, we had a pretty severe income-tax burden for people at a low level of income. It was actually kind of appalling,” said Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-of-center research group in Washington. “Policy makers in both parties realized that was bad policy and started whittling away at it” by expanding credits and tinkering with tax rates.After those changes and the new law, comparing average tax rates for poor households and wealthy households, 2013 might be the most progressive tax code since 1979. But economists cautioned that measuring progressivity is tricky. “It’s not like there is some scientific measure of progressivity all economists agreed upon,” said Leonard E. Burman, a professor of public affairs at Syracuse University. “People look at different numerical measures and they’ve changed in different ways at different income levels.”Mr. Viard said that over time the code had become markedly more progressive for the poor compared with the middle class. But it arguably did not become much more progressive for the rich compared with the middle class, or the very rich compared with the rich, in part because of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts on investment income.An anesthesiologist who earns a $500,000 salary subject to payroll and income taxes might pay a higher tax rate than a hedge fund manager making $1 billion subject mostly to capital-gains taxes, for instance.Economists are also divided on the ultimate effect of those tax increases on the wealthy to income growth and income inequality in the United States. The recession hit the incomes of the rich hard, but they have snapped back much more strongly than those for middle or low-income workers.“I’d still rather be really rich, even if I’m getting taxed much more than a low-income person” would be, Mr. Williams of the Tax Policy Center added."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/asia/japanese-envoy-tries-to-mend-ties-with-south-korea.html,"SEOUL, South Korea — Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan reached out to South Korea’s incoming president, Park Geun-hye, on Friday by sending a special envoy to Seoul with calls for mending ties that had become strained under their predecessors.But no immediate breakthrough was expected as the two main East Asian allies of the United States exchanged barbs couched in diplomatic language, a reflection of their long-running differences, rooted in Japan’s often brutal colonial rule of Korea from 1910 until 1945.The Japanese envoy, Fukushiro Nukaga, a lawmaker in the Liberal Democratic Party, met Ms. Park in her Seoul office on Friday, delivering a letter from Mr. Abe and the Japanese leader’s invitation for Ms. Park to visit Tokyo. Mr. Nukaga relayed Mr. Abe’s call for a close cooperative relationship with Ms. Park, hoping that “the launching of new governments in both countries will mark a good starting point in bilateral relations,” said Cho Yoon-sun, a spokeswoman for Ms. Park.Ms. Park shared a similar wish, calling for more exchanges between the two countries.Analysts said the sending of the special envoy to Seoul may be a sign that Mr. Abe is trying to prevent the worsening of ties between Japan and its neighbors, which have grown increasingly strained over a series of territorial spats.During its successful campaign for the Dec. 16 parliamentary election, Mr. Abe’s party eagerly tapped nationalistic emotions stoked by the territorial disputes. And during her own campaign for South Korea’s Dec. 19 presidential election, Ms. Park, like all her predecessors, vowed not to show weakness in the disputes with Japan.Despite his conciliatory message, Mr. Nukaga’s trip was overshadowed by simmering tensions. A group of South Korean activists rallied in the Seoul airport in opposition to his visit, and one stabbed himself in the belly with a knife to show his anger at what he called Japan’s refusal to repent for its colonial-era brutalities. With blood streaming down his body, the 63-year-old man was taken to a hospital. The police said his injury was not serious.When Mr. Nukaga’s delegation met Foreign Minister Kim Sung-hwan of South Korea later Friday, it criticized a South Korean court’s decision on Thursday not to extradite a man accused of an arson attack at Tokyo’s Yasukuni Shrine for Japan’s war dead, the Foreign Ministry said.The man, Liu Qiang, who is Chinese, served 10 months in a South Korean prison for a separate arson attack at the Japanese Embassy in Seoul in January last year. Calling Mr. Liu’s December 2011 attack on the Yasukuni Shrine a “political crime,” the Seoul court rejected South Korean prosecutors’ effort to have him extradited to Tokyo. On Friday, he was allowed to fly home to China, where many nationalistic bloggers treated him like a hero.Mr. Abe, a right-wing politician whose nationalist comments had often enraged South Koreans, returned as prime minister after his party’s landslide election victory in December. Ms. Park, a conservative, is to be inaugurated next month.Both come to office after their countries’ relations deteriorated over a longstanding dispute over a set of islets. In August, South Korea’s departing president, Lee Myung-bak, became the first Korean leader to land on the islets, controlled by South Korea and claimed by Japan.Officials here said Mr. Lee’s visit was driven partly by Japan’s refusal to come to terms with its treatment of Korean and other Asian women, who historians say were forced or lured into working in military-run brothels for Japan’s soldiers in World War II. Mr. Abe and some members of his cabinet had previously angered Koreans and Chinese by suggesting that there was no evidence that Japan’s military forced those women into sexual servitude.When she met the Japanese envoy on Friday, Ms. Park emphasized that “reconciliation and cooperation” should be accompanied by a “correct understanding of history.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/us/politics/owners-of-auto-racetracks-retain-a-tax-break.html,"WASHINGTON — In the rush to pass tax legislation, owners of auto racetracks scored a victory this week even as many other industries were left behind.With the help of devoted Nascar fans in Congress and lobbyists in Washington, track owners secured a one-year extension of an expiring tax break that allows them to write off investments in their property over 7 years, rather than the more typical 15 years.That break for speed racing and similar benefits granted to select businesses in the new tax deal will cost the Treasury tens of millions of dollars over the next decade, at the same time the government struggles with its growing debt.“This allows us to compete with football, baseball and basketball, whose facilities are often financed with state and local tax money,” said Daniel W. Houser, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the International Speedway Corporation of Daytona Beach, Fla., which owns and operates 13 auto racetracks. He said the tax provision would allow the company to carry out a “a robust capital spending plan.”Mr. Houser described the tax break as a form of economic stimulus. “We have shovel-ready projects that are ready to put people to work,” he said.Preservation of such tax breaks came as lawmakers said they were scouring the budget and the tax code for every dollar that could be saved. After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, federal debt is bumping up against the legal limit of $16.4 trillion.The tax break for “motorsports entertainment complexes,” a part of the tax bill signed Wednesday by President Obama, is estimated to cost $78 million over 10 years. It would cost more if it were extended again or made permanent, as the industry wants. By contrast, Congress sliced billions of dollars from hospitals and other health care providers.A few years ago, enthusiasm for motor sports soared, but in recent years Nascar and others like the IndyCar Series have struggled. The recession crimped the wallets of Nascar’s typically middle-aged, working-class fan base.The auto racetrack provision was one of many business tax breaks extended by Congress. Others continue tax incentives for film and television productions and for railroad track maintenance. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, included the auto racetrack provision in a long list of “special interest giveaways.”But supporters said it was justified, even at a time of big budget deficits. “This tax provision is a job creator,” said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and co-chairman of the Congressional Motorsports Caucus.Nascar, based in Daytona Beach and controlled by the France family, has an influential voice in Washington. Its employees made $347,400 in campaign contributions in the 2012 cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, a site that tracks campaign donations.Marcus Jadotte, a vice president of Nascar, said that while his company did not represent racetracks directly affected by the legislation, “we support the efforts of Congress to preserve the same tax treatment that motorsports facilities have been operating under for decades.”International Speedway, the Nascar sister company that owns and operates racetracks, derives 90 percent of its revenue from Nascar events.Mr. Houser said the tax break could also benefit hundreds of racetracks owned by other companies like Speedway Motorsports and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Nascar and International Speedway are members of the National Motorsports Coalition, which lobbied for the tax break in meetings with lawmakers.Wayne Allard, a Republican former senator from Colorado who is now vice president for government relations at the American Motorcyclist Association, a member of the coalition, said that membership and interest in the association had waned, with the group now running about 3,000 events a year, down from 4,000. The tax break, besides encouraging physical improvements at tracks and creating jobs, could help “prop up our membership,” he said.Among those who lobbied for the tax break was John F. Kelly Jr. of Cornerstone Government Affairs, a Capitol Hill firm that represents International Speedway. Mr. Kelly was a tax policy adviser at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush and then director of federal relations for Walmart.With passage of the tax bill, Mr. Kelly and his firm also won a victory for another client, Beam Inc., whose Cruzan rum is distilled in the United States Virgin Islands. The new law continues an arrangement under which federal excise taxes on imported rum are shared with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The territories have used the money to promote and assist the rum industry and to finance economic development projects.The tax break in the new federal law closely resembles the language of racetrack tax bills introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, home to the auto industry and the Michigan International Speedway; Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, home of the Daytona International Speedway; and Dean Heller, a Republican senator and former representative from Nevada, home of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.Among the co-sponsors, or chief backers, were Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, home of the Kansas Speedway, and the senators from North Carolina, home base for many race teams and the Nascar industry — Richard M. Burr, a Republican, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat.Also supporting the legislation was Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, whose love for the sport earned him the nickname Mr. Nascar. Mr. Kyl, who just retired from Congress, used to volunteer at the Phoenix International Raceway.Ms. Stabenow’s Web site includes pictures of her at a Nascar race at the Michigan track in August.But Cullen Schwarz, a spokesman for Ms. Stabenow, said of the tax break: “This is not a special deal for Nascar. It’s for racetrack companies. It keeps them on a seven-year depreciation schedule, the same as other entertainment venues with major capital expenditures like amusement parks.”Nascar, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was founded by Bill France Sr. in December 1947, and the family continues to own and operate the business today. His son, Bill Jr., was head of Nascar until 2000, and currently, Bill France Sr.’s grandson, Brian France, is Nascar’s chairman and chief executive. Brian’s sister, Lesa France Kennedy, serves on Nascar’s board and is the chief executive of the International Speedway Corporation.Brian France and Lesa France Kennedy have held fund-raisers for Mr. Buchanan at the Daytona speedway and have become regular donors to Republican and Democratic campaigns.In Charlotte, N.C., in August, Mr. France and several team owners held a fund-raiser for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, who had stirred a political fuss by saying he had “some great friends that are Nascar team owners.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/us/politics/inaugural-contributors-identified.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama drew criticism last month for allowing unlimited corporate donations to finance his inaugural festivities. But when his inaugural planners released the names of donors late Friday afternoon, only a handful of companies were on the list of several hundred contributors.AT&T, Financial Innovations Inc.

Individual names made up much of the rest of the list, available on the inaugural committee’s Web site.The committee said it posted the list, which will be updated regularly, in keeping with its “commitment to transparency.” But the document does not contain the amount of the donations; that will become available 90 days after the inaugural, when the Federal Election Commission makes the committee’s financing report public."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/nyregion/lawyers-fight-admissibility-of-messages-in-liu-fund-raising-case.html,"On July 10, 2011, Jia Hou, the treasurer for the presumptive mayoral campaign of John C. Liu, the city comptroller, warned a colleague that auditors would closely scrutinize donor forms.“Just make sure the handwriting looks as close to the donors’ as possible,” Ms. Hou wrote in an electronic message to Jorge Fanjul, who, like Ms. Hou, worked in Mr. Liu’s government office. “If too difficult, don’t take risk.”“Gotcha,” Mr. Fanjul replied.The electronic-message exchange is one of several potentially incriminating communications that a lawyer on Friday asked a judge to bar prosecutors from using at Ms. Hou’s trial next month in Federal District Court in Manhattan. The exchange had nothing to do with the scheme Ms. Hou is charged with, the lawyer said in court papers.Ms. Hou, 26, and a former Liu fund-raiser, Xing Wu Pan, have each been charged in an illegal campaign-finance scheme. Both have pleaded not guilty. Mr. Liu, whose campaign-finance practices have been under federal investigation, has not been charged with wrongdoing.Mr. Pan’s lawyers said in court papers on Friday that they may call or subpoena Mr. Liu to testify as a defense witness for Mr. Pan. The lawyers, Irwin Rochman and Gregory J. Rochman, declined to comment about that plan.The new filings by Ms. Hou’s lawyer also reveal that she and a lawyer who was then representing her met with federal prosecutors last February, one day before Ms. Hou was arrested.“It’s my understanding that she asserted her innocence of any wrongdoing, and has maintained that position always,” her current lawyer, Gerald B. Lefcourt, said Friday.During the proceeding with federal prosecutors, known as a proffer session, Ms. Hou, who is also known as Jenny, also offered no information to suggest that Mr. Liu had been involved in wrongdoing, a Federal Bureau of Investigation summary shows.Prosecutors declined to comment on the filings.Mr. Liu’s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said on Friday: “This was a meeting in which people had different purposes. Jenny wanted to explain that she had done nothing wrong, and the government hoped that she would speak badly about John Liu. She didn’t and she got indicted.”During the session, Ms. Hou said that after meeting Mr. Liu in 2008, he contacted her and urged her to work for him.“Initially, Hou was not interested in working for Liu, but Liu kept asking,” the F.B.I. summary says.She began working for him as a volunteer in the summer of 2009, and the next year, she worked for him in the comptroller’s office; later, she became his campaign treasurer, the summary says.The documents also show the pressure Ms. Hou felt to meet fund-raising goals and to surpass Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, a leading candidate for mayor.“Let me get thru this deadline alive,” she told a former boyfriend, Thomas Wang, in one electronic communication, referring to her fund-raising work.Judge Richard J. Sullivan has set a trial date of Feb. 4."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/us/politics/scare-amplifies-fears-that-clintons-work-has-taken-heavy-toll.html,"WASHINGTON — When Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton fractured her right elbow after slipping in a State Department garage in June 2009, she returned to work in just a few days. Her arm in a sling, she juggled speeches and a trip to India and Thailand with physical therapy, rebuilding a joint held together with wire and pins.It was vivid evidence of Mrs. Clinton’s indomitable stamina and work ethic — as a first lady, senator, presidential candidate and, for the past four years, the most widely traveled secretary of state in American history.But after a fall at home in December that caused a concussion, and a subsequent diagnosis of a blood clot in her head, it has taken much longer for Mrs. Clinton to bounce back. She was released from a hospital in New York on Wednesday, accompanied by her daughter, Chelsea, and her husband, former President Bill Clinton. On Thursday, she told colleagues that she hoped to be in the office next week.Her health scare, though, has reinforced the concerns of friends and colleagues that the years of punishing work and travel have taken a heavy toll. Even among her peers at the highest levels of government, Mrs. Clinton, 65, is renowned for her grueling schedule. Over the past four years, she was on the road for 401 days and spent the equivalent of 87 full days on a plane, according to the State Department’s Web site.In one 48-hour marathon in 2009 that her aides still talk about, she traveled from talks with Palestinian leaders in Abu Dhabi to a midnight meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, then boarded a plane for Morocco, staying up all night to work on other issues, before going straight to a meeting of Arab leaders the next morning.“So many people who know her have urged me to tell her not to work so hard,” said Melanne S. Verveer, who was Mrs. Clinton’s chief of staff when she was first lady and is now the State Department’s ambassador at large for women’s issues. “Well, that’s not easy to do when you’re Hillary Clinton. She doesn’t spare herself.”It is not just a matter of duty, Ms. Verveer and others said. Mrs. Clinton genuinely relishes the work, pursuing a brand of personal diplomacy that, she argues, requires her to travel to more places than her predecessors.While there is no medical evidence that Mrs. Clinton’s clot was caused by her herculean work habits, her cascade of recent health problems, beginning with a stomach virus, has prompted those who know her best to say that she desperately needs a long rest. Her first order of business after leaving the State Department in the coming weeks, they say, should be to take care of herself.Some even wonder whether this setback will — or should — temper the feverish speculation that she will make another run for the White House in 2016.“I am amazed at the number of women who come up to me and tell me she must run for president,” said Ellen Chesler, a New York author and a friend of Mrs. Clinton’s. “But perhaps this episode will alter things a bit.”Given Mrs. Clinton’s enduring status as a role model, Ms. Chesler said women would be watching which path she decides to take, as they plan their own transitions out of the working world.“Do remember that women of our generation are really the first to have worked through the life cycle in large numbers,” she added. “Many seem to be approaching retirement with dread.”For now, aides say, Mrs. Clinton’s focus is on wrapping up her work at the State Department. She would like to take part in a town hall-style meeting, thank her staff and sit for some interviews. But first she has to get clearance from her doctors, who are watching her to make sure that the blood thinners they have prescribed for her clot are working.Speaking to a meeting of a foreign policy advisory board from her home in Chappaqua, N.Y., on Thursday, Mrs. Clinton said she was crossing her fingers and encouraging her doctors to let her return next week. “I’m trying to be a compliant patient,” she said, according to a person who was in the room. “But that does require a certain level of patience, which I’ve had to cultivate over the last three and a half weeks.”While convalescing, Mrs. Clinton has spoken with President Obama and has held a 30-minute call with Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, whom Mr. Obama nominated as her successor.Mrs. Clinton also plans to testify, while still in office, about the deadly attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, making up for hearings in December that she missed because of her illness. Because the Senate will be in recess until Jan. 21, and it must then confirm Mr. Kerry, she is expected to stay on as secretary of state until the end of the month.“She would have vastly preferred to testify that original date than go through the last 27 days,” said her senior adviser, Philippe Reines. “Only an imbecile would say otherwise,” he added, referring to charges by conservatives that Mrs. Clinton faked her illness to avoid the Congressional questioning.But her illness has scuttled further travel, including hopes for a valedictory tour of Asia or the Middle East. Mrs. Clinton holds the record for the most countries visited by a secretary of state, 112, though her total of 956,733 air miles will fall short of the 1.06 million logged by her predecessor, Condoleezza Rice.The travel demands caught Mrs. Clinton by surprise, especially in an era in which American officials can communicate via videoconference calls. But the technology, she has said, paradoxically puts a bigger premium on actually showing up. And Mr. Obama has traveled abroad sparingly, raising the pressure on her to do more.On many trips, Mrs. Clinton flew overnight and, after landing, went straight into a 12- or 16-hour day, sometimes getting a quick shower at the American ambassador’s residence. On a visit to South Asia in 2009, she spent three consecutive nights on her plane, an Air Force Boeing 757, which is equipped with a small cabin and a bed.Unlike Ms. Rice, who is seven years her junior, Mrs. Clinton is not an exercise enthusiast. And her diet over the past four years has been a mix of exotic fare in distant capitals and airplane food. While the military stewards often prepared a bowl of cereal and berries, Mrs. Clinton faced her share of breakfast burritos.“On these trips, you’re in all these different time zones, your body clock is way off schedule, you’re not routinely getting exercise, and you’re not eating healthy food,” said Lissa Muscatine, a former speechwriter who traveled with Mrs. Clinton. “On top of that, she has to be operating at the height of mental acuity at all times.”Given Mrs. Clinton’s temperament, friends say there is little likelihood that she will ever take it easy.Ms. Muscatine recalled that when Mrs. Clinton was racing to finish her memoir, she often spent a full day in the Senate, worked at home until midnight, and then held meetings about the book at her dining room table that stretched past 3 a.m.“While we always thought of her as invincible and indestructible,” Ms. Muscatine said, “we all just really hoped there would be a point where she could stop going at that breakneck pace.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/a-step-toward-gay-marriage.html,"The Illinois Legislature begins a new session on Wednesday with a chance to make up for a narrowly missed opportunity to legalize gay marriage. Supporters had been confident that a bill would pass in the final days of the lame-duck session, making Illinois the 10th marriage-equality state, but the bill stalled in the Senate late last week and the clock ran out. The bill’s sponsor, Senator Heather Steans, a Chicago Democrat, said that she had the 30 votes for passage, but a vote on Thursday was called off because some Democrats were absent, the legislative equivalent of seniors cutting class in finals week.But the delay is likely to be short. The momentum toward gay marriage, in Illinois as elsewhere, has been astonishingly swift, and the bill has prominent supporters in Gov. Pat Quinn, Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago and President Obama, who said through a spokesman that he would vote for it if he were still in the Legislature. Even the State Republican chairman, Pat Brady, endorsed the bill, making the conservative case that gay marriage means stronger families.Resistance has been led by Chicago’s Roman Catholic cardinal, Francis George, who calls gay marriage an affront to natural law. But the views of the opponents will soon be less relevant: the incoming Legislature will have a supermajority of Democrats — holding 71 of 118 House seats and 40 of 59 Senate seats — strengthening the chances that gay marriage will arrive in Illinois, sooner rather than later. "

But my hunch on this return to China, my old home, is that change is coming.Here’s my case for Xi as a reformer.First, it’s in his genes. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a pioneer of economic restructuring and publicly denounced the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Xi’s mother chooses to live in Shenzhen, the most capitalist enclave in the country.Xi is also one of the first Chinese leaders to send a child to the United States as an undergraduate. His daughter is a junior at Harvard, reflecting her parents’ emphasis on learning English and their admiration for American education.It helps that the bar is low for Xi: he follows President Hu Jintao, who is widely regarded in China as a failure. Even government ministers complain that he squandered his 10 years as leader. Today there is pent-up demand for change.President Hu, who always reads speeches from texts, is a robot who surrounds himself with robots. One such robot aide is Ling Jihua, whose 23-year-old son was driving a Ferrari one night last March with two half-naked women as passengers. The car crashed on a Beijing road, killing the young man and badly injuring the women, one of whom later died.Ling feared a scandal and reportedly began a cover-up. He went to the morgue, according to the account I got from one Chinese official, and looked at the body — and then coldly denied that it was his son. He continued to work in the following weeks as if nothing had happened. The cover-up failed, and the episode underscored all that was wrong with the old leadership: the flaunting of dubious wealth, the abuse of power and the lack of any heart.Xi is trying to send a message that he is different. His first act upon becoming Communist Party general secretary in November was to replicate a famous “southern tour” by Deng Xiaoping in 1992 that revived economic reforms. Xi and his team have also startled officials by telling them to stop reading empty speeches at meetings.Another good sign: I hear that Wang Yang, a reformist who has been the party chief in Guangdong Province and is perhaps the single most capable leader in China today, will be named a vice premier in March.The new leaders would probably prefer to accelerate economic change while minimizing political relaxation, but that is increasingly difficult as China develops an educated, worldly and self-confident middle class. Over the years, most of China’s neighbors — from Taiwan to Mongolia, South Korea to Thailand — have become more democratic, and now even Myanmar is joining the parade. How can mighty China be more backward than Myanmar?For 25 years, I’ve regularly been visiting my wife’s ancestral village in the Taishan area of southern China. At first, the villagers were semiliterate and isolated, but now their world has been transformed. On this visit, we dropped by a farmhouse where a former peasant was using the Internet to trade stocks on his laptop. His daughter is in college, and he watches Hong Kong television on a big screen.People like him are ever harder to control or manipulate, and they’re steamed at China’s worsening corruption. A couple of decades ago, a friend who is a son of a Politburo member was paid several hundred thousand dollars a year to lend his name to a Chinese company so that it could get cheap land from local governments. These days, the family members of leaders can rake in billions of dollars over time.The 70 richest delegates to China’s National People’s Congress have a collective net worth of almost $90 billion, Bloomberg News reported. That’s more than 10 times the collective net worth of the entire American Congress.Granted, there is evidence to counter my optimistic take. Most troubling, the authorities are cracking down on the Internet. That’s a great leap backward, but I am skeptical that it will be sustained. Right now a fascinating test case is unfolding: a senior propaganda official censored a New Year’s message in a major Guangdong newspaper, and now journalists are publicly demanding that he be fired. Stay tuned.Xi is also more nationalistic than President Hu, and I worry that a confrontation with Japan over disputed islands could escalate out of control — in which case all bets are off.Still, the pre-eminent story of our time is the rise of China. For the last decade it has been hobbled by the failed leadership of President Hu. I’m betting that in the coming 10 years of Xi’s reign, China will come alive again."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/new-rules-for-the-new-year.html,"2012: I call it the year in “meh.” Not the worst we’ve ever experienced, but nothing particularly great to say about it either. Like being a socialite, but in Tampa.I am looking forward to 2013, however, because I love the odd-numbered years — they’re the ones without congressional elections, Olympics, World Cups or weird extra days tacked onto the calendar by so-called scientists. Odd-numbered years are chill. They’re the 3 p.m. of years — that small sliver of time when lunch is digested and it’s too early to think about dinner and you stand at least a fighting chance of getting something done.In that spirit, here are the New Rules for the new year:NEW RULE Now that their end-of-the-world prophecy has proved to be complete baloney, the Mayans must be given a job predicting election results for Fox News.NEW RULE Sometime during the 2013 awards show season, “Gangnam Style” must be given an award for the shortest amount of time between my finding out what something is to my being completely sick of it. Besting the time of 7 hours, 12 minutes, set by “The Macarena” in 1996.NEW RULE Congress must make it a tradition to drive off the fiscal cliff every year. And I mean really off the cliff, like Toonces the cat drove that car. This way Republicans can learn that lower military spending won’t lead to China invading. And Democrats can learn that no one cares what the Commerce Department does anyway.NEW RULE No more mixing politics with pizza. The filthy rich founder of Papa John’s, John Schnatter, said he’d cut his employees’ hours to avoid the costs of Obamacare. This is where I’d normally suggest boycotting Papa John’s, but that’s like telling people to boycott sadness. Nobody eats Papa John’s because they like it. They eat it because Domino’s won’t deliver to crack houses.NEW RULE The winners of next month’s Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show must later compete against the winners of “Toddlers & Tiaras” — so we can get their handlers in one place, lock the doors and let the kids and dogs run for their lives.NEW RULE The New Year’s Eve ball drop must be moved to one of the two states that recently legalized pot, so we can hear the crowd sing in unison, “Should old acquaintance be... what are the words again?”NEW RULE Second-term Obama must have a few laughs by acting out the Tea Party’s worst fears. He must order Air Force One to fly everywhere upside-down like Denzel and replace Bo the White House dog with two pit bulls named “Malcolm” and “X.”NEW RULE Drugstores, supermarkets, department stores and all other retail establishments must stop asking me to join their “club.” A club is a place to have a few drinks. What you’re offering me is two dollars off a bottle of NyQuil. And that’s nothing like being in a club. Unless I drink the whole bottle at once.NEW RULE You can’t run for president if you don’t know how old the world is. Quizzed recently, Marco Rubio answered, “I’m not a scientist, man.” As if you have to be Galileo to Google, “How old is the earth?” And when asked his thoughts on evolution, Chris Christie said, “None of your business!” Which is what you say when someone asks you if you made a baby with the maid. Fellas, if you and your party want to be taken seriously, you don’t have to recite the collected works of Stephen Hawking — just stop regurgitating the Facebook page of Sarah Palin.NEW RULE If we must sit through a 30-second ad to see your Web site, you have to take down all of those banner ads, which no one has clicked on since 1997. Please — I’m trying to watch a video of a nipple slip from last night’s episode of “Real Housewives of Atlanta.” Let’s not cheapen it."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/world/asia/india-takes-aim-at-poverty-with-cash-transfer-program.html,"NEW DELHI — India has more poor people than any nation on earth, but many of its antipoverty programs end up feeding the rich more than the needy. A new program hopes to change that.On Jan. 1, India eliminated a raft of bureaucratic middlemen by depositing government pension and scholarship payments directly into the bank accounts of about 245,000 people in 20 of the nation’s hundreds of districts, in a bid to prevent corrupt state and local officials from diverting much of the money to their own pockets. Hundreds of thousands more people will be added to the program in the coming months.In a country of 1.2 billion, the numbers so far are modest, but some officials and economists see the start of direct payments as revolutionary — a program intended not only to curb corruption but also to serve as a vehicle for lifting countless millions out of poverty altogether.The nation’s finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, described the cash transfer program to Indian news media as a “pioneering and pathbreaking reform” that is a “game changer for governance.” He acknowledged that the initial rollout had been modest because of “practical difficulties, some quite unforeseen.” He promised that those problems would be resolved before the end of 2013, when the program is to be extended in phases to other parts of the country.Some critics, however, said the program was intended more to buy votes among the poor than to overcome poverty. And some said that in a country where hundreds of millions have no access to banks, never mind personal bank accounts, direct electronic money transfers are only one aspect of a much broader effort necessary to build a real safety net for India’s vast population.“An impression has been created that the government is about to launch an ambitious scheme of direct cash transfers to poor families,” Jean Drèze, an honorary professor at the Delhi School of Economics, wrote in an e-mail. “This is quite misleading. What the government is actually planning is an experiment to change the modalities of existing transfers — nothing more, nothing less.”The program is based on models in Mexico and Brazil in which poor families receive stipends in exchange for meeting certain social goals, like keeping their children in school or getting regular medical checkups. International aid organizations have praised these efforts in several places; in Brazil alone, nearly 50 million people participate.But one of India’s biggest hurdles is simply figuring out how to distinguish its 1.2 billion citizens. The country is now in the midst of another ambitious project to undertake retinal and fingerprint scans in every village and city in the hope of giving hundreds of millions who have no official identification a card with a 12-digit number that would, among other things, give them access to the modern financial world. After three years of operation, the program has issued unique numbers to 220 million people.Bindu Ananth, the president of IFMR Trust, a financial charity, said that getting people bank accounts can be surprisingly beneficial because the poor often pay stiff fees to cash checks or get small loans, fees that are substantially reduced for account holders.“I think this is one of the biggest things to happen to India’s financial system in a decade,” Ms. Ananth said.Only about a third of Indian households have bank accounts. Getting a significant portion of the remaining households included in the nation’s financial system will take an enormous amount of additional effort and expense, at least part of which will fall on the government to bear, economists said.“There are two things this cash transfer program is supposed to do: prevent leakage from corruption, and bring everybody into the system,” said Surendra L. Rao, a former director general of the National Council of Applied Economic Research. “And I don’t see either happening anytime soon.”The great promise of the cash transfer program — as well as its greatest point of contention — would come if it tackled India’s expensive and inefficient system for handing out food and subsidized fuel through nearly 50,000 government shops.India spends almost $14 billion annually on this system, or nearly 1 percent of its gross domestic product, but the system is poorly managed and woefully inefficient.Grains, for instance, pass through myriad hands, with much of the supply being diverted or replaced with rotten or poor-quality grains before it reaches its intended recipients. Rajiv Gandhi, who served as prime minister for five years in the late 1980s before being assassinated in 1991 while running for office, once estimated that only 15 percent of the money spent on the poor actually reached them; his son Rahul Gandhi said recently that this level may now be as low as 5 percent.But so far the government has stopped short of replacing the direct distribution of food and fuel with cash payments because of the enormous logistical difficulties involved, and because many of those involved in pilot projects in which cash was substituted for goods have said they preferred receiving food.There are several problems with making a switch, experts say. One is that men are often the ones who receive cash in the programs, and they sometimes squander the money. When food is distributed, however, women are often the recipients, and they are more likely to use the food to benefit their children.Another problem is that while cash transfers can significantly reduce losses to corrupt intermediaries and traders, simply setting up the system does little to overhaul the sometimes-corrupt decision-making process that determines who is eligible for benefits in the first place.A group of 208 scholars and activists released an open letter on Monday, the day before the pilot program started, saying that electronic transfers of pensions and scholarships were fine but substituting cash for food “could cause havoc and massive social exclusion.”Still, Arvind Panagariya, an economics professor at Columbia University and the former chief economist of the Asian Development Bank, contended that opposition to the program was shortsighted, dismissing fears that the poor would squander the money they receive.“The argument that people will not spend on the essential goods when given cash for that is spurious and paternalistic,” Dr. Panagariya said in an interview.The Indian government’s aggressive timetable for rolling out the cash transfer program has led some of its political opponents to claim that the entire exercise is mostly about securing political support for the governing coalition led by the Indian National Congress Party.A World Bank study found that there is a direct link between cash transfer programs and voting patterns, with beneficiaries strongly supporting the party that gave them money. A significant number of early enrollees in the program live in states controlled by the Congress Party.Giving cash to “India’s poor is all about power, politics and winning elections,” a recent article in the popular newsmagazine Outlook India argued.The government has promised to continue the program’s rollout through 2014, when national elections are scheduled. The Election Commission of India ordered the government last year to postpone starting the program in eight districts in the states of Himachal Pradesh and Gujarat because of pending state elections, which were held last month.Mr. Rao, the economic researcher, cautioned that the rural poor would need a vastly improved social and commercial infrastructure — better shops, schools and hospitals — for any cash-based welfare plan to significantly improve their lives.“Cash transfers,” he said, “are not a panacea.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/us/politics/obama-and-gop-gear-up-for-next-fiscal-fight.html,"WASHINGTON — In dueling weekly addresses, the White House and Republicans drew lines in the sand for their next fiscal showdown, which could be as soon as next month, when a Congressional fight is expected on raising the nation’s borrowing limit.Democrats have warned Republican leaders not to use the debt authorization for political leverage. In his weekly address, President Obama again said he would not trade spending cuts for an increase in the debt limit.“One thing I will not compromise over is whether or not Congress should pay the tab for a bill they’ve already racked up,” he said. “If Congress refuses to give the United States the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic.”Mr. Obama also repeated his new demand that future spending cuts be met with commensurate tax increases. “Spending cuts must be balanced with more reforms to our tax code,” he said. “The wealthiest individuals and the biggest corporations shouldn’t be able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren’t available to most Americans.”A similar standoff over raising the debt limit in 2011 led Standard & Poor’s for the first time to downgrade its rating of United States Treasury debt by one notch, suggesting a higher risk of default. The impasse caused a slump in the market, and analysts fear that another one could cause yet more damage.Many Republicans have said they do not plan to lift the country’s statutory borrowing limit unless Democrats agree to significant spending cuts, particularly to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.In the Republican address, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, argued that Congress needed to focus on cutting spending and simplifying the tax code.“Many of our Democrat colleagues just don’t seem to get it,” he said. “Throughout the fiscal cliff discussions, the president and the Democrats who control Washington repeatedly refused to take any meaningful steps to make Washington live within its means. That position is irresponsible and fails to acknowledge what every family in America already knows: when you have no more money in your account and your credit cards are maxed out, then the spending must stop.”Just after the new year, Congress agreed to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and delay for two months significant cuts to the discretionary budget, brokering the deal to avoid the worst of the tax increases and spending cuts known collectively as the “fiscal cliff.” But the deal, which will cut the deficit by an estimated $650 billion over 10 years, is far smaller than the trillions of dollars in deficit reduction initially sought by negotiators.It also left several issues for the 113th Congress to resolve, including raising the debt ceiling, trying to defuse some of the mandated discretionary-spending cuts and averting a government shutdown. Those will come to a head in February and March. If Congress fails to lift the ceiling, a cash management crisis will result, as the Treasury will lack the money to pay all the country’s bills on time."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/technology/legislation-would-regulate-tracking-of-cellphone-users.html,"WASHINGTONTHERE are three things that matter in consumer data collection: location, location, location.E-ZPasses clock the routes we drive. Metro passes register the subway stations we enter. A.T.M.’s record where and when we get cash. Not to mention the credit and debit card transactions that map our trajectories in comprehensive detail — the stores, restaurants and gas stations we frequent; the hotels and health clubs we patronize.Each of these represents a kind of knowing trade, a conscious consumer submission to surveillance for the sake of convenience.But now legislators, regulators, advocacy groups and marketers are squaring off over newer technology: smartphones and mobile apps that can continuously record and share people’s precise movements. At issue is whether consumers are unwittingly acquiescing to pervasive tracking just for the sake of having mobile amenities like calendar, game or weather apps.For Senator Al Franken, the Minnesota Democrat, the potential hazard is that by compiling location patterns over time, companies could create an intimate portrait of a person’s familial and professional associations, political and religious beliefs, even health status. To give consumers some say in the surveillance, Mr. Franken has been working on a locational privacy protection bill that would require entities like app developers to obtain explicit one-time consent from users before recording the locations of their mobile devices. It would prohibit stalking apps — programs that allow one person to track another person’s whereabouts surreptitiously.The bill, approved last month by the Senate Judiciary Committee, would also require mobile services to disclose the names of the advertising networks or other third parties with which they share consumers’ locations.“Someone who has this information doesn’t just know where you live,” Mr. Franken said during the Judiciary Committee meeting. “They know the roads you take to work, where you drop your kids off at school, the church you attend and the doctors that you visit.”Yet many marketers say they need to know consumers’ precise locations so they can show relevant mobile ads or coupons at the very moment a person is in or near a store. Informing such users about each and every ad network or analytics company that tracks their locations could hinder that hyperlocal marketing, they say, because it could require a new consent notice to appear every time someone opened an app.“Consumers would revolt if this was the case, and applications could be rendered useless,” said Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican, who promulgated industry arguments during the committee meeting. “Worse yet, free applications that rely on advertising could be pushed by the consent requirement to become fee-based.”Mr. Franken’s bill may seem intended simply to protect consumer privacy. But the underlying issue is the future of consumer data property rights — the question of who actually owns the information generated by a person who uses a digital device and whether using that property without explicit authorization constitutes trespassing.In common law, a property intrusion is known as “trespass to chattels.” The Supreme Court invoked the legal concept last January in United States v. Jones, in which it ruled that the government had violated the Fourth Amendment — which protects people against unreasonable search and seizure — by placing a GPS tracking device on a suspect’s car for 28 days without getting a warrant.Some advocacy groups view location tracking by mobile apps and ad networks as a parallel, warrantless commercial intrusion. To these groups, Mr. Franken’s bill suggests that consumers may eventually gain some rights over their own digital footprints.“People don’t think about how they broadcast their locations all the time when they carry their phones. The law is just starting to catch up and think about how to treat this,” says Marcia Hofmann, a senior staff lawyer at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, a digital rights group based in San Francisco. “In an ideal world, users would be able to share the information they want and not share the information they don’t want and have more control over how it is used.”Even some marketers agree.One is Scout Advertising, a location-based mobile ad service that promises to help advertisers pinpoint the whereabouts of potential customers within 100 meters. The service, previously known as ThinkNear and recently acquired by Telenav, a personalized navigation service, works by determining a person’s location; figuring out whether that place is a home or a store, a health club or a sports stadium; analyzing weather and other local conditions; and then showing a mobile ad tailored to the situation.Eli Portnoy, general manager of Scout Advertising, calls the technique “situational targeting.” He says Crunch, the fitness center chain, used the service to show mobile ads to people within three miles of a Crunch gym on rainy mornings. The ad said: “Seven-day pass. Run on a treadmill, not in the rain.”When a person clicks on one of these ads, Mr. Portnoy says, a browser-based map pops up with turn-by-turn directions to the nearest location. Through GPS tracking, Scout Advertising can tell when someone starts driving and whether that person arrives at the site.Despite the tracking, Mr. Portnoy describes his company’s mobile ads as protective of privacy because the service works only with sites or apps that obtain consent to use people’s locations. Scout Advertising, he adds, does not compile data on individuals’ whereabouts over time.Still, he says, if Congress were to enact Mr. Franken’s location privacy bill as written, it “would be a little challenging” for the industry to carry out, because of the number and variety of companies involved in mobile marketing.“We are in favor of more privacy,” Mr. Portnoy says, “but it has to be done within the nuances of how mobile advertising works so it can scale.”A  SPOKESMAN for Mr. Franken said the senator planned to reintroduce the bill in the new Congress. It is one of several continuing government efforts to develop some baseline consumer data rights.“New technology may provide increased convenience or security at the expense of privacy and many people may find the trade-off worthwhile,” Justice Samuel Alito wrote last year in his opinion in the Jones case. “On the other hand,” he added, “concern about new intrusions on privacy may spur the enactment of legislation to protect against these intrusions.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/us/politics/bill-pushes-for-more-legislative-sessions-in-texas.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — Long before lawmakers prepared to gather at the sand-colored Capitol here on Tuesday for the opening day of the legislative session, State Representative Richard Peña Raymond had already filed a little-noticed bill to drastically change not only how they conduct business, but also how often.Texas is one of only four states whose legislatures convene in regular session every two years. Lawmakers in Texas meet in odd-numbered years only — as do legislators in Montana, Nevada and North Dakota — while those in the 46 other states hold legislative sessions yearly, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.Mr. Raymond’s bill would require the Texas Legislature to meet in regular session in odd-numbered years and to hold a budget session in even-numbered years. The move would mean annual meetings and budgets, an idea that has been debated for decades but has long been viewed with suspicion in a place that prizes small government, low taxes and deregulation.“As big a budget as we have, as big a state as we are, as diverse of an economy as we have, we really should be looking at annual budgets,” said Mr. Raymond, a Democrat from Laredo and a former member of the Appropriations Committee, which writes the budget. “There’s no business in the private sector that does two-year budgets. It’s a very outdated idea.”In Texas, the biennial sessions unfold quickly — beginning at noon on the second Tuesday in January and ending in May after a 140-day run. It is a tradition dating back 137 years, when the State Constitution was ratified and required the Legislature to meet every two years.Although the state’s population has grown in that time to nearly 26 million people from about 1 million, Texas has held on to the biennial tradition. Several Republican lawmakers and conservative activists said it suited them, and the political culture, just fine.They described Mr. Raymond’s bill — his third attempt to change the system since the 2009 session — as a long shot at best. Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature, and even if the bill were to pass, a constitutional amendment changing the legislative schedule to annual sessions would have to be approved by Texas voters before it could take effect.“There’s not a single Republican who would vote for that,” said Steve Ogden, a Republican senator from Bryan who was preparing to officially retire on Tuesday after 22 years in the Legislature. “I think one of the reasons that Texas does as well as it does is because the Legislature meets as infrequently as it does. In a state that believes in limited government, I think it works well for us.”Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, appeared to agree with Mr. Ogden. “The governor believes we need to limit government in people’s lives, not expand it,” said Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry. “A part-time Legislature allows lawmakers to come in and complete the business of Texans and then go out and live under the laws that they’ve passed.”As with other state issues, the debate over biennial sessions falls along party lines. Republicans argue that meeting every other year prevents the Legislature from passing frivolous bills, forces lawmakers to focus under considerable deadline pressure and keeps part-time legislators from becoming full-time politicians.Some Democrats and political scientists say the infrequency of the sessions increases the power of the governor and state agencies because of a lack of oversight. They also say it makes the budget process a difficult task amid ever-changing national and state economies. (This session, lawmakers will adopt a budget for the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years.)“It’s very fast-paced and tumultuous and inefficient to have a short 140-day session every other year in a state as big and as complex as Texas,” said Calvin Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. “You’re trying to budget and anticipate revenues and the need for expenditures 30 months out, and that’s very difficult to do.”Lawmakers, of course, work more often than the legislative schedule implies. Mr. Perry has used his power to call special sessions several times during his 12 years as governor. In even-numbered years, the Capitol does not shut down, but hums quietly with committee hearings. But unlike lawmakers in California, New York and other large states, Texas legislators have the populist distinction, and pay, that come from being part-timers.Members of the House and the Senate are paid $7,200 annually. A per diem for living expenses during the sessions stands at $150 but will most likely rise to $179 through a vote this month by the Texas Ethics Commission. Legislators spend at least part of their time focused on other jobs. Many are lawyers, and others are ranchers, business consultants, insurance agents and pharmacists.Cindy Burkett, a Republican representative from Mesquite, oversees a company that operates Subway sandwich shops. Charles Anderson, a Republican representative who is known as Doc, is a longtime veterinarian. (He planned to be at the Capitol for opening day on Tuesday and back at his practice in Waco later in the week.) Several conservatives said in effect that they want Dr. Anderson to spend as much time on his clients as he does on legislative bills.“The California Legislature meets, I think, 30 hours a day, 9 days a week, 412 days a year, and they seem to invent new ways to cause problems for their citizens,” said Michael Quinn Sullivan, the president of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility. “The last thing Texas needs is a Legislature that meets more often.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/us/texas-legislature-faces-a-new-set-of-priorities.html,"The last time Texas lawmakers convened in Austin, they were absorbed with numbers and boundaries: how to make ends meet with a deflated state budget and draw new district maps the courts would approve.But with improving fiscal conditions and redistricting mostly in the rearview mirror, they are approaching the 2013 legislative session with some pressing policy questions, from whether to introduce private school vouchers into the state’s public education system to whether they should put in effect — and accept financing for — major provisions of the federal health care overhaul.Meanwhile, lawmakers will face the consequences of the sweeping cuts and budget-balancing tricks of the 2011 session, including a multibillion-dollar Medicaid shortfall and a lawsuit — expected to be appealed to the Texas Supreme Court early this year and decided in the summer — over how the state finances public education.The Legislature is also staring down the barrel of some other major investments, from ensuring that Texas has the water to meet its soaring population growth to finding consistent revenue streams for long-delayed transportation projects.Do not expect a full respite from hot-button issues; lawmakers have already offered legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks, and to allow teachers to carry concealed handguns in school classrooms. But the Legislature’s Republican majority may take a softer tack toward immigration bills this session, after a national election in which the growing Hispanic population moved even further into the Democratic camp.A look at the anticipated legislation, issues and political battles in the 83rd session.PUBLIC EDUCATIONWhether to pass school choice reform — and what shape it might take — could be one of the biggest battles of the 2013 session. A key aspect of any proposal will be whether parents can use public money to send children to private schools. Support for such a measure does not fall along party lines, and it has divided Republicans in the past.Lawmakers are also poised to take on the state’s public school accountability system because of widespread reaction against the use of high-stakes standardized tests to measure student performance. Dan Patrick, Republican of Houston and the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, and Michael L. Williams, the state’s education commissioner, have offered proposals that rate schools on a scale of A to F; other legislators have suggested doing away with state testing.Education advocates and some lawmakers will push to restore some or all of the $5.4 billion in public school budget cuts made during the 2011 session. But any decision will hinge on the resolution of a major school finance lawsuit against the state. A Texas Supreme Court decision, anticipated in early summer, could bring lawmakers back to Austin to revamp the state’s method of financing public schools.After the mass shootings last month at a Connecticut elementary school, lawmakers could also consider measures to heighten security at public schools, including a bill to let school employees carry concealed handguns.Look to Mr. Patrick to be the gatekeeper on education policy in the Senate. Key lawmakers to watch in the House include John Otto, Republican of Dayton and an appropriations guru, and Jimmie Don Aycock, Republican of Killeen, who has taken the lead on school finance issues. MORGAN SMITHHEALTH CARELawmakers will be responding to scandals in the health care arena that have rocked the state’s cancer research institute and its Medicaid program, and federal reforms that will dramatically alter Texas’ medical landscape.As criminal and civil investigations of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas continue, rebuilding public trust in the $3 billion, voter-approved initiative will be a top priority. Lawmakers have also filed bills to tackle Medicaid fraud among dental and orthodontic providers.In response to federal health care reform — so-called Obamacare — lawmakers must decide whether Texas will expand Medicaid to cover poor, uninsured adults or set up an Orbitz-like online insurance exchange. Mr. Perry has insisted that Texas will not play ball, but decisions by the state’s Republican majority could pressure the governor to accept federal reforms and the money that comes with them.Some lawmakers may be reconsidering a $73 million cut to family planning services that was made in the last session, which was largely an effort to force Planned Parenthood out of state programs. They will also be looking at the rules and financing of the Texas Women’s Health Program, the successor of a federally financed program that ended after the state enforced a rule banning providers affiliated with abortion clinics.Abortion opponents are also backing a “fetal pain” measure that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, and a bill to place tougher requirements on doctors who perform abortions. BECCA AARONSONHOUSE SPEAKEROnce upon a time, speakers of the Texas House easily won re-election until they overstayed their welcome, falling victim to politics or scandals. But during the tenure of Joe Straus, the current speaker, and his predecessor, Tom Craddick, there have been challenges at the beginning of every legislative session.Mr. Straus, Republican of San Antonio, unseated Mr. Craddick, Republican of Midland, in 2009. In 2011, he fended off a rambunctious challenge from Representative Ken Paxton, Republican of Plano, who has since moved on to the Texas Senate.Now it is Representative David Simpson carrying the challenger’s banner.Mr. Simpson, Republican of Longview, is entering only his second term, but he proved during his freshman term that he was not a go-along-to-get-along guy. He got in the way of restrictions on so-called puppy mills two years ago, even though the sponsor was Senfronia Thompson, the venerated Houston Democrat who was in a position to spike all of the upstart’s legislation.He argued loudly and unsuccessfully in favor of restricting federal airport searches and gave a personal privilege speech — a fancy term for a heartfelt oratorical address to the House that cannot be interrupted for debate — railing against the machinations he said prevented passage of the “anti-groping” legislation.Now his disdain for Mr. Straus’s leadership has blossomed into a full-blown challenge for his job. After members take their oaths of office on Tuesday to begin their new terms, they will decide whether to stick with Mr. Straus or switch to Mr. Simpson. ROSS RAMSEYTHE GOVERNORAfter enduring a humiliating run for president, and his first electoral loss ever, Mr. Perry heads into the session looking to rebuild his brand.He will most likely do it by championing the no-holds-barred conservatism that made him a presidential contender in the first place.Over the next few months, look for Mr. Perry to push a “fetal pain” bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, possibly as an “emergency” item that would fast track the measure. He said recently that he sees it as a step toward his goal of ending abortion rights entirely.Mr. Perry will also call for drug testing welfare recipients, and Texans can count on him to resist anything that sounds like a federal mandate, whether it relates to health care, the environment or guns.The governor says people should be allowed to carry concealed weapons in any public place. His response to the mass shooting in Connecticut? Let teachers carry guns.Mr. Perry is likely to face some awkward wrangling over tax incentives and grants to private companies that promise to create jobs — he calls it economic development, but many Tea Party conservatives see the programs as corporate welfare.The governor promises to reveal his political plans this summer. He has said he is leaning toward a re-election race, and he could begin another presidential bid in 2016. At a Tea Party gathering a few weeks ago, Mr. Perry was quoted as saying he still has “a burning desire in my heart to see this country led by a God-fearing conservative patriot.” JAY ROOTENERGYIn a state that remains in a severe drought, the overarching energy and environment issue this session will undoubtedly be water.Lawmakers will consider proposals to draw $1 billion or more from the Rainy Day Fund to help finance water projects. State Representative Lyle Larson, Republican of San Antonio, has already filed such a bill.High water rates charged by private companies in rural Texas are also likely to receive scrutiny, especially as lawmakers assess whether to move water rate oversight to the Public Utility Commission from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The utility commission is undergoing a comprehensive “sunset” review by the Legislature this session, an assessment of the need for a state agency.The Texas Railroad Commission, like the utility commsssion, is also under sunset review. That could result in a name change (the leading candidate is the Texas Energy Resources Commission, which reflects the agency’s oil and gas oversight) as well as scrutiny of the agency’s enforcement policies for drillers.The Legislature will also most likely be looking at how effectively Ercot, the state grid operator, resolves its long-term problem of limited power supplies and growing demand.Environmentalists will be pushing for the restoration of financing to state parks, which saw budget cuts last session. Twenty state parks could close if the money does not materialize, according to Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. KATE GALBRAITHHIGHER EDUCATIONIdeas for getting more out of Texas colleges and universities without giving them more money will dominate higher education discussions in the coming session.Under a plan proposed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the eligibility pool for the state’s largest need-based grant program would be reduced and the award decreased, allowing financing to stretch farther in a more targeted population. This will be the first session in which the Senate’s higher education committee, which was created in 2009, has not been run by Senator Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo. Senator Kel Seliger, Republican of Amarillo, is the new chairman.Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas and the chairman of the House Higher Education Committee, has already signaled his priorities: filing a bill that would require universities to offer students the option of a four-year, fixed-rate tuition plan and seeking to tweak the state’s enrollment-based approach to appropriations by tying as much as 25 percent of financing to performance measures like graduation rates. Mr. Perry has endorsed variations of both proposals.The governor does not expect legislation ending Texas’ longstanding policy of giving some illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates and access to financial aid to reach his desk. But such a bill has been filed, and it could be one of the session’s most contentious higher education issues. REEVE HAMILTONIMMIGRATIONUnlike last session, lawmakers have not prefiled a mountain of immigration legislation. After President Obama’s strong showing among Hispanic voters in the November general election, analysts suggest, Texas Republicans may be revising their message.Some state lawmakers, however, remain intent on keeping the issue front and center. State Representative Lyle Larson, Republican of San Antonio, has filed a bill to repeal in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, and another that could make it easier for county governments to construct immigration detention centers.Representative Bill Zedler, Republican of Arlington, has filed a bill that would crack down on day labor centers where unauthorized workers congregate to look for temporary work.Mr. Perry has not said whether legislation to ban so-called sanctuary cities in Texas would be a priority. But he recently reiterated his support for the measure, which would expand the immigration enforcement authority of local law enforcement officers.After the United States Supreme Court’s decision in June to uphold what critics call the “show me your papers” provision of the controversial Arizona immigration law, Texans could see a similar bill filed this year.But there could also be unprecedented pushback, as Texas Republicans watch the state’s demographics shift and seek to draw more Hispanics into the party’s ranks.At their state party convention in June, Republicans voted to include a call for a national guest-worker program in their platform, a public acknowledgment that some of the party’s rhetoric may have alienated Hispanic voters. JULIÁN AGUILARCRIMINAL JUSTICEIn the realm of courts and prisons, continuing debate is expected over the role of prosecutorial misconduct in Texas’ wrongful convictions.Michael Morton, who was exonerated in 2011 after spending nearly 25 years in prison for his wife’s murder, is already lobbying legislators to find more ways to hold prosecutors accountable when they make mistakes that lead to wrongful convictions.  Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston and chairman of the Innocence Project board, is likely to take the lead on this issue.Following a year of renewed violence in Texas’ youth lockups — youth-against-youth violence this time, as opposed to the staff-on-youth assaults of 2005 that resulted in system reforms — lawmakers will work to improve the state’s troubled juvenile justice system. Discussion is likely to center on whether to close even more of the state’s facilities; currently there are just 6, down from 15 a few years ago.Reform advocates have long urged legislators to consider smaller secure facilities that are closer to urban centers, instead of the massive ones in rural parts of the state.In the months ahead, Texas could also make more history with its prison system. In 2011, lawmakers shut down the aging Central Unit near Houston; it was the first time the state had ever closed a prison.Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the longtime leader of the upper chamber’s Criminal Justice Committee, has already hinted that he would like to see two more Texas prisons closed as the inmate population continues to decline. Mr. Whitmire will be taking charge of prison issues after the retirement of his longtime partner in criminal justice, Representative Jerry Madden, Republican of Plano. BRANDI GRISSOMTRANSPORTATIONOther budget priorities have overshadowed transportation for years, but Texans may see some major movement on two fronts in 2013.After a decade of relying largely on debt and tolls to advance road projects without raising taxes, state leaders, including Mr. Perry and the speaker of the House, Mr. Straus, are calling for the development of a more dependable revenue stream. The current financing system, largely bolstered by gas taxes, has been unable to keep pace with the cost of maintaining roads, let alone developing new routes to relieve congestion. A proposal to dedicate the sales tax on new vehicle purchases to transportation financing is drawing strong interest.Commuter rail may also see a big boost this year if private development of a high-speed rail system and public efforts to expand rail lines in North Texas move forward.Following Mr. Perry’s veto of a 2011 texting-while-driving ban, lawmakers could reconsider behind-the-wheel legislation to counter distracted driving.Lawmakers may also provide ways for state and local authorities to hold oil and gas production companies responsible for the damage their vehicles and equipment do to roads in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Barnett Shale regions.

Mark Kelly is a former Navy pilot and NASA astronaut and is the husband of the former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who survived an assassination attempt in 2011. The couple has formed a political action committee, Gabby PAC, to promote civil political discourse and the election of moderates to Congress. Captain Kelly is also the author of “Mousetronaut,” a recently published children’s book loosely based on a mouse that accompanied him on one of his space shuttle missions.READING I used to read a lot of science fiction — Robert Heinlein and Isaac Asimov — but then I started doing science reality. Now I read more nonfiction, particularly if it has a military aspect to it. I’m about halfway through “Unbroken,” by Laura Hillenbrand. The strength, toughness and tenacity of the main character reminds me of my wife, Gabby. Also I flew ground attack in Operation Desert Storm, which is what the character in “Unbroken” was doing in World War II, so I could relate to the story a little bit. I got shot at a lot, but I never got shot down like he did.LISTENING That doesn’t change much for me: U2 and Aerosmith. Also Coldplay. We picked their song “Speed of Sound” to go along with a slide show we put together for my second space shuttle flight. It went really well with the pictures. Also, Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, is married to Gabby’s second cousin, Gwyneth Paltrow. Calexico is one of Gabby’s favorite bands. They’re from Tucson and are a rock band but their music has a heavy Mexican influence, with mariachis. It’s pretty neat with the horns.WATCHING Gabby and I saw the latest James Bond movie, “Skyfall.”  It was good, but my personal favorite 007 movie is “Casino Royale,” because of the poker scene. I used to have a poker game at home a couple of times a month. I wasn’t good, but more important than that, the people I was playing with — other astronauts and a few neighbors — were really bad.PURCHASING I bought my wife a new engagement ring for our fifth anniversary — a diamond with a couple of sapphires. I never was happy with the first one. She was happy with it, but I thought she deserved better.RACING I recently went with a friend and drove a couple of racecars — a Porsche 911 and 944 — at Inde Motorsports Ranch, a private track in Willcox, Ariz. It was a lot of fun. Without spaceflight being available to me anymore, I have to find a replacement. It reminded me of flying high-speed, low-altitude routes in the military.EATING I’ve started to eat more kale. But delicious and kale are not synonymous. If you put it in scrambled eggs, it isn’t so bad."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/education/michael-bloomberg-compares-teachers-union-to-the-nra.html,"Of all the polarizing things Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said and done over the years, from banning large sugary drinks to supporting congestion pricing, few have generated the sort of viral backlash that has unexpectedly mounted after his weekly radio show on Friday.The mayor had embarked on a lengthy stream of consciousness on the need to negotiate a new teacher evaluation plan with the United Federation of Teachers. Toward the end, Mr. Bloomberg, almost as an aside, likened the teachers’ union to groups like the National Rifle Association and others in which he said a few leaders were out of sync with large numbers of rank-and-file members.“It’s typical of Congress, it’s typical of unions, it’s typical of companies, I guess, where a small group is really carrying the ball and the others aren’t necessarily in agreement,” Mr. Bloomberg said to the program host, John Gambling. “The N.R.A. is another place where the membership, if you do the polling, doesn’t agree with the leadership.”The comparison drew somewhat of a muted response. Michael Mulgrew, the president of the union, issued a one-sentence statement later on Friday saying the remark was “completely inappropriate” and indicative of the continuing difficulty in the union’s relationship with the mayor.But by Sunday, 70 people had signed a letter by the union to the mayor, which said the union was among the first to give counseling and other help to those in Newtown, Conn., after the school shootings there on Dec. 14.Among those who signed the letter were most of the presumptive Democratic mayoral candidates. Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, had not signed it as of Sunday evening, but her aides said she intended to.And on Monday, the union was scheduled to hold a news conference to underscore its outrage and to demand that the mayor apologize.This was not the first time Mr. Bloomberg had invoked the National Rifle Association when registering his frustration with the city teachers’ union and others. He voiced similar opinions at a news conference in 2007, in the face of resistance to part of his educational agenda at the time.“As the mayor has said before, the union is a special-interest group focused on advancing its agenda, whether it’s in the public interest or not,” Deputy Mayor Howard Wolfson said in a statement on Sunday. “Their refusal to agree to a fair evaluation deal is just the latest example of this.”Randi Weingarten, the president of the American Federation of Teachers and the former president of its New York City affiliate, wrote a separate letter to the mayor, noting that two of the adults killed in Connecticut were members of her union. She said that despite Mr. Bloomberg’s “great work” on gun safety, he owed the city teachers and its union leaders an apology “for making such incendiary and insensitive remarks — especially coming on the heels of the tragedy in Newtown.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-says-no-to-more-tax-increases.html,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, made clear on Sunday that he would oppose any effort by the Obama administration to raise more tax revenue and that he remained focused on finding ways to cut spending as the government grapples with its debt.“The tax issue is finished,” Mr. McConnell said on the ABC News program “This Week.” “Over. Completed. That’s behind us.”Mr. McConnell’s interviews on three Sunday morning programs came just days after he and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. helped broker a resolution to the latest fiscal crisis and as Washington braced for a series of confrontations over debt and spending.Mr. McConnell’s stance on taxes countered calls from Democrats, and even some House Republicans, to revamp the tax code to close some provisions and raise new revenue. But Mr. McConnell did say he would favor changes if they were “revenue neutral,” meaning that lower rates would be paid for by limiting deductions and closing loopholes.Mr. McConnell’s focus on the need for spending cuts was relentless in his interviews on ABC, NBC and CBS. He was equally insistent that President Obama must take the lead on fiscal plans.His remarks stood in contrast to comments from the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who said on the CNN program “State of the Union” that there was plenty of room to increase revenue by examining “deductions, credits, special treatments under the tax code.”Mr. McConnell’s position also contrasted with remarks on Saturday by Mr. Obama, who said in his weekly address that he remained open to both spending cuts and further tax increases. The fiscal agreement last week made tax cuts permanent for most households and put off big spending cuts.Mr. Obama, who was speaking from Hawaii before returning to Washington on Sunday, emphasized his own line in the sand. Now that the government has reached its statutory borrowing limit, Mr. Obama said, Congress had no choice but to raise it to avoid a damaging default. He said the matter was not up for negotiation.“If Congress refuses to give the United States the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic,” Mr. Obama said. “Our families and our businesses cannot afford that dangerous game again.”Mr. McConnell repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he supported Republican senators who have suggested that a default — and even a brief shutdown of the government — might be necessary to secure deep spending cuts.“My answer is hopefully we don’t need to get to that point,” he said on ABC. “The president surely must know we’re spending way too much. So why don’t we do something about reducing spending?”Mr. McConnell also suggested that other Obama administration priorities, including a new push for gun restrictions after the Connecticut school shooting, might have to wait.Mr. McConnell was asked about reports that Mr. Biden, whom Mr. Obama charged with developing proposals to address gun violence, had confidently predicted the passage of gun-control legislation this month.Mr. McConnell seemed to cast cold water on that notion.“The biggest problem we have at the moment is spending and debt,” he said. “That’s going to dominate the Congress between now and the end of March. None of these issues, I think, will have the kind of priority that spending and debt will have.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/world/middleeast/palestinian-authority-threatened-by-fiscal-crisis-premier-says.html,"RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) — The Palestinian government is in “extreme jeopardy” because of a financial crisis largely caused by Arab countries’ failure to send hundreds of millions of dollars in promised aid, the Palestinian prime minister said Sunday.The crisis has worsened in recent years, and the government, the Palestinian Authority, has reached the point of not being able to pay the salaries of about 150,000 government employees, said the prime minister, Salam Fayyad. If the crisis continues, he said, the number of Palestinians in poverty is bound to double to 50 percent of the population of roughly four million people.The Palestinian Authority, set up two decades ago as part of interim peace deals with Israel, is on the “verge of being completely incapacitated,” Mr. Fayyad warned.The government was meant to be temporary and to be replaced by a Palestinian state, which was to be established through negotiations with Israel. But those talks have repeatedly broken down, and for the past four years the two sides have been unable to agree on the terms for renewing them.In November, the authority’s president, Mahmoud Abbas, won United Nations recognition of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem as a nonmember observer state, overriding Israeli objections to the largely symbolic step. On Sunday, Mr. Abbas asked his government, which is based in the West Bank, to prepare for replacing the words “Palestinian Authority” with “State of Palestine” in all public documents, including identification cards, drivers licenses and passports.Israeli officials declined to comment.A statement from Mr. Abbas’s office said the move was aimed at enhancing Palestinian “sovereignty on the ground” and was a step toward “real independence.”Israel, which still controls most of the West Bank, objected to the Palestinian statehood bid, calling it a step aimed at bypassing direct peace negotiations.In December, Israel halted its monthly transfer of about $100 million in tax rebates it collects on behalf of the Palestinians. That sum amounts to about one-third of the monthly operating costs of the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Fayyad put most of the blame for the Palestinian Authority’s financial troubles on delinquent Arab donors, saying they are “not fulfilling their pledge of support in accordance with Arab League resolutions.”European countries kept their aid commitments, he said.About $200 million in American aid was held up by Congress last year, a sum the Obama administration hopes to deliver to the Palestinians this year, along with $250 million more."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/opinion/greeces-rotten-oligarchy.html,"AthensDEMOCRACY is like a bicycle: if you don’t keep pedaling, you fall. Unfortunately, the bicycle of Greek democracy has long been broken. After the military junta collapsed in 1974, Greece created only a hybrid, diluted form of democracy. You can vote, belong to a party and protest. In essence, however, a small clique exercises all meaningful political power.For all that has been said about the Greek crisis, much has been left unsaid. The crisis has become a battleground of interests and ideologies. At stake is the role of the public sector and the welfare state. Yes, in Greece we have a dysfunctional public sector; for the past 40 years the ruling parties handed out government jobs to their supporters, regardless of their qualifications.But the real problem with the public sector is the tiny elite of business people who live off the Greek state while passing themselves off as “entrepreneurs.” They bribe politicians to get fat government contracts, usually at inflated prices. They also own many of the country’s media outlets, and thus manage to ensure that their actions are clothed in silence. Sometimes they’ll even buy a soccer team in order to drum up popular support and shield their crimes behind popular protection, as the drug lord Pablo Escobar did in Colombia, and as the paramilitary leader Arkan did in Serbia.In 2011, Evangelos Venizelos, who was then the finance minister and is now the leader of the socialist party, Pasok, instituted a new property-tax law. But for properties larger than 2,000 square meters — about 21,000 square feet — the tax was reduced by 60 percent. Mr. Venizelos thus carved out a big exemption for the only people who could afford to pay the tax: the rich. (Mr. Venizelos is also the man responsible for a law granting broad immunity to government ministers.)Such shenanigans have gone on for decades. The public is deprived of real information, as television stations, newspapers and online news sites are controlled by the economic and political elite.Another scandal involves the so-called Lagarde List. In 2010, Christine Lagarde, then the French finance minister (and now the head of the International Monetary Fund), gave the Greek government a list of roughly 2,000 Greek citizens with Swiss bank accounts, to help uncover tax fraud. Greek officials did virtually nothing with the list; two former finance ministers, George Papaconstantinou and his successor, Mr. Venizelos, reportedly even told Parliament they did not know where it was. Meanwhile, several media outlets falsely accused some politicians and business figures of being on the list in order to conceal the ugly reality: rich people were evading taxes while their desperate fellow citizens were searching the trash for food.When Hot Doc, the monthly magazine I edit and publish, made the list public in October, I was arrested and charged with violating personal privacy, but was acquitted. The result didn’t please those in power. So I am being brought back for a second trial (a date has yet to be set) on similarly vague allegations. Throughout the entire process — the publication of the list, my arrest, my acquittal — the Greek media were absent. The case was a top story in the international press, but not in the country where it took place.The reason is simple. The Lagarde list implicates a corrupt group that answers to the name of democracy even as it casually nullifies it: officials with offshore companies, friends and relatives of government ministers, bankers, publishers and those involved in the black market.After my magazine released the list, the Greek government made not a single statement about the case.When Mr. Venizelos left the Finance Ministry last March, he failed to turn the CD with the list over to his successor. He took it with him. Only when his successor, Yannis Stournaras, told The Financial Times in October that he had never received the list did Mr. Venizelos turn it over to the prime minister’s office. He was never asked about the delay, and leaders of the three parties in the coalition government have not referred his conduct to Parliament’s investigatory committee.Meanwhile, a newly released version of the list made clear that someone had removed the names of three relatives of Mr. Papaconstantinou, who was the finance minister from 2009 to 2011, before Mr. Venizelos. Last month, Mr. Papaconstantinou was expelled from Pasok. He now faces a Parliamentary investigation, the potential lifting of his immunity from prosecution as a former minister, and charges of tampering with the data. It appears that he may become a new Iphigenia, a scapegoat sacrificed so that the corrupt political system can survive.This is all unfolding at a time when Greece is walking a tightrope above the abyss of bankruptcy, while the coalition government is instituting new taxes on the lower classes. Half of young Greeks are unemployed. The economy is shrinking at an annual rate of 6.9 percent. People are scrounging for food. And a neo-Nazi party, Golden Dawn, is on the rise, exploiting the resentment and rage toward the ruling class.The Greek people must remount their bicycle of democracy by demanding an end to deception and corruption. Journalists need to resist manipulation and rediscover their journalistic duties. And the government should revive Greece’s ancient democratic heritage — instead of killing the messenger."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/us/politics/paul-ryan-balances-pragmatism-and-politics.html,"WASHINGTON — After Senator John McCain’s failed presidential bid in 2008, he repaired to the Senate to become a thorn in President Obama’s side. His running mate, Sarah Palin, used her considerable clout on the right to rally her fervent supporters against Mr. Obama and Democrats.But when the vice-presidential hopes of Representative Paul D. Ryan were dashed this Election Day, he returned to the House of Representatives and last week helped pass a bipartisan tax deal sought by Mr. Obama.Mr. Ryan’s vote in support of the plan, which raised tax rates on high income while locking in lower rates for the vast majority of households, was both pragmatic and political. In what he described as a “tough decision,” he backed what was seen by most in Congress as a piece of legislation whose passage was necessary to avert a fiscal crisis. Notably, his support aligned him with Speaker John A. Boehner, who voted for the measure. But it put him in conflict with his two fellow “young guns,” Representatives Eric Cantor of Virginia and Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 and 3 House Republicans. The three men had been in virtual lock step on policy issues and wrote a book together.It was the first in a series of votes on budget and deficit reduction measures expected in the coming months, all potentially reverberating in the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. A potential rival to Mr. Ryan for the nomination, should both decide to run, is Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was among only eight senators to vote no, the first clear demarcation between the two men since the election.(Before the vote, when asked by a reporter if Mr. Rubio’s “no” vote would influence his own, Mr. Ryan laughed and said, “Give me a break!” according to a recounting on Twitter.)Congressional supporters of Mr. Ryan describe his vote as an illustration of leadership. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he was motivated by the chance to make the lower tax rates for most households permanent, these supporters say. And as a legislator whose actions are watched closely by fellow members, they add, he does not have the luxury of taking a purely ideological stance.Mr. Ryan, his supporters say, did not necessarily return to the House to start building a presidential campaign. Instead, he is interested in continuing to mix things up as one of his party’s leading voices on budget matters. He is interested in forging an even tighter bond with Mr. Boehner as the fiscal fights play out, they say, starting in the coming weeks with a debate over whether to authorize raising the government’s borrowing limit and how to avoid deep across-the-board spending cuts set in motion by previous compromises. “I understand why somebody would want to vote no, but I understand why we had to vote yes,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who voted in favor of the deal. “But leadership is voting yes when you need to, and we needed to, because if the bill had failed, the stock markets wouldn’t have gone up 300 points; they would have gone down 1,000, and all those guys pounding their chests would have folded like a cheap suit.”He added: “I thought it was a very responsible vote.”In a statement released by his office after the vote, Mr. Ryan described his decision this way: “Will the American people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative? In the final analysis, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I came to Congress to make tough decisions — not to run away from them.”Mr. Rubio, in a statement explaining his vote, warned that “rapid economic growth and job creation will be made more difficult under the deal reached here in Washington.” He added: “This deal just postpones the inevitable, the need to solve our growing debt crisis and help the 23 million Americans who can’t find the work they need.”Those close to Mr. Rubio point to what they say is his unwavering allegiance to conservative principles and note that his sticking point was the tax increase on the highest earners.“It’s bad policy that fails to address the real fiscal issues facing our country,” said Alex Conant, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio. “When it comes to taxes, we need tax reform that will promote growth. That’s the only way to solve our fiscal problems in the long run, and nothing in the package that was passed was designed to promote growth.”Of course, it is always tricky to gauge the political impact a vote will have four years later. When Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards, as senators, voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002, their positions were seen as a political no-brainer. Yet during the 2008 Democratic primary, Mr. Obama’s initial opposition to the Iraq war helped catapult him to the nomination.Mr. Ryan’s vote, which lent support to Mr. Boehner, also places him squarely in a role he has long found comfortable: that of the dutiful Republican soldier. Mr. Ryan voted in favor of many large and contentious issues — the Medicare prescription drug plan, the bank and auto bailouts — and in the process cast aside conservative orthodoxy to support his party’s leadership.His tax vote, however, was also a calculated one. He believes that the coming fights on spending and deficit reduction will fall squarely in his budget “sweet spot,” in the words of a friend. And with Mr. Boehner’s backing, Mr. Ryan has a better chance of influencing those debates.On Friday, in a vote that seemed to move him closer to his image as a fiscal hawk intent on lowering government spending, Mr. Ryan joined 66 Republican members to oppose a flood insurance bill that would take on more than $9 billion in debt to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.  “Paul has the long game in mind, so taking short-term pops at Boehner does not advance the conservative agenda,” an associate close to Mr. Ryan said. “He’s politically invested in his partnership with Boehner.”Many Congressional Republicans said they understood both positions on the fiscal bill, and though Mr. Ryan incurred some anger online from the right wing, those in Washington said that the 2016 race would probably turn on larger fights yet to come.“I just don’t think 2016 is going to be litigated through the lens of this one vote,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former adviser to Mitt Romney, “because in a month or two, we’re going to be onto a whole new deadline fight, and there will be plenty of votes and plenty of areas where you can still build your political profile and your electoral profile where you’re a viable candidate in 2016 — the full body of work so to speak.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/technology/ad-blocking-raises-alarm-among-firms-like-google.html,"PARIS — Xavier Niel, the French technology entrepreneur, has made a career of disrupting the status quo.Now, he has dared to take on Google and other online advertisers in a battle that puts the Web companies under pressure to use the wealth generated by the ads to help pay for the network pipelines that deliver the content.Mr. Niel’s telecommunications company, Free, which has an estimated 5.2 million Internet-access users in France, began last week to enable its customers to block Web advertising. The company is updating users’ software with an ad-blocking feature as the default setting.That move has raised alarm among companies that, like Google, have based their entire business models on providing free content to consumers by festooning Web pages with paid advertisements. Although Google so far has kept largely silent about Free’s challenge, the reaction from the small Web operators who live and die by online ads has been vociferous.No Internet access provider “has the right to decide in place of its citizens what they access or not on the Internet,” Spiil, an association of French online news publishers, said in a statement Friday.The French government has stepped into the fray. On Monday Fleur Pellerin, the French minister for the digital economy, plans to convene a meeting of the feuding parties to seek a resolution.Free’s shock to advertisers was widely seen as an attack on Google, and is part of the larger, global battle over the question of who should pay to deliver information on the Web — content providers or Internet service providers. An attempt to rewrite the rules failed at the December talks of the International Telecommunication Union in Dubai, after the United States and other nations objected to a proposal that, among other measures, would have required content providers to pay.Mr. Niel declined to comment on Sunday, through a spokeswoman, Isabelle Audap.But he has often complained that Google’s content, which includes the ever expanding YouTube video library, occupies too much of his network’s bandwidth, or carrying capacity. “The pipelines between Google and us are full at certain hours, and no one wants to take responsibility for adding capacity,” he said during an interview last year with the newsmagazine Nouvel Observateur. “It’s a classic problem that happens everywhere, but especially with Google.”Analysts said that French regulators would probably not oppose an agreement between Free and Google aimed at smoothing traffic flows and improving the quality of the service, as long as competitors were not disadvantaged. But they said regulators would probably not allow an Internet access provider to unilaterally block content.When it comes to blocking ads, though, disgruntled consumers do not have to rely on their Internet service providers. Consumers already have the option of downloading software like Adblock Plus to do the job for them.Free is the second-largest Internet access provider in France, behind Orange, which is operated by France Telecom and has 9.8 million Internet customers. Because Free seeks to be a low-cost competitor, the company may feel itself particularly vulnerable to the expense of providing capacity to meet Internet users’ ever-growing demand for streaming and downloading videos, music and the like.Ms. Pellerin, the digital economy minister, expressed sympathy for Free’s position in an interview with Le Figaro, published Saturday. “There are today real questions about the sharing of value between the content providers — notably in video, which uses a lot of bandwidth — and the operators,” she said.“In France, and in Europe,” Ms. Pellerin added, “we have to find more consensual ways of integrating the giants of the Internet into national ecosystems.” And in a subsequent Twitter message, she said she was “no fan of intrusive advertising, but favorable to a solution of no opt-out by default.”Google, which is currently engaged in delicate antitrust negotiations with the European Union, has been largely silent about the Free episode, appearing content to let other aggrieved parties take the lead. Al Verney, a Google spokesman in Brussels, said Sunday, “We are aware of Free’s actions and are investigating the impact.” He declined to comment further.Free’s ad-blocking campaign began last week when it rolled out a new generation of hardware and software that enables users to block Web advertising. Free has set the ad-blocking software as the default option.Numerama, a news site, thundered in an editorial that the move “demonstrates the power that Internet service providers can have on the content of Web sites, and the risk it represents to democracy.” Free, it said, “penalizes thousands of sites that can only make it through online ads,” including Numerama itself. Affected sites can either “join in a game of cat and mouse with Free to escape the filter,” it said, or “change their business models.”Jean-Baptiste Fontana, founder of Frequence-sud.fr, a news site, argued that smaller Web sites were being left to suffer the collateral damage, in Free’s fight with Google.On Atlantico, an online news site, Mr. Fontana wrote: “Numerous Web sites, and particularly the online press, have worked out a moral contract with their readers: You get valuable information, we don’t make you pay, because the advertisers pay for you.”But “should either the reader or the Internet service provider break that contract, the entire system collapses,” Mr. Fontana continued. “It brings us back to the economic model of the press: who pays for information?”If nothing else, the dispute has been a publicity coup for Mr. Niel, who is the majority shareholder in Iliad, the publicly traded company that operates Free. He is also half-owner of the French daily Le Monde.Iliad reported third-quarter revenue of €819 million, or about $1.1 billion. The company’s shares have gained more than 36 percent over the past year.Mr. Niel’s online business background dates to the days of the Minitel, the French precursor to the Internet in the 1980s. Then, a decade ago he upended the market with the introduction of an inexpensive broadband package offering Internet access, fixed-line telephone calls and television. Last year Iliad entered France’s mobile telephone market, shattering the cozy dominance of the three established carriers with ultra-low-cost service."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/world/asia/with-eye-on-china-japan-weighs-raising-military-spending.html,"TOKYO — Japan’s new conservative government announced a review of national military strategy on Monday that analysts said was aimed at offsetting China’s growing military power and that may increase defense spending for the first time in a decade.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe ordered his government to replace the nation’s five-year military spending plan and to review defense guidelines adopted in 2010 by the left-leaning Democratic Party, which his party defeated in elections last month. Those guidelines called for gradual reductions in defense spending, and in the size of Japan’s military, particularly in the number of tanks and infantry members.Mr. Abe had promised during the election campaign to strengthen the military to defend Japan’s control of islands in the East China Sea that are also claimed by China.Mr. Abe did not release details of his intent on the military revisions, but news reports said the replacement plan would probably reverse the Democrats’ cuts, starting with a 120 billion yen, or $1.4 billion, increase in the military budget in the 2013 fiscal year, which begins in April. That would be the first increase in Japanese military spending since 2002, as the nation has tightened its belt during a long economic decline.The reports said the new spending plan, proposed by members of Mr. Abe’s governing Liberal Democratic Party, would seek to increase the number of ground troops, strengthen air and sea defenses around the disputed islands, and buy new early-warning aircraft to guard against Chinese intrusions near the islands, as well as missile launchings by North Korea.The reports said the plan could also include financing for a feasibility study on acquiring Osprey aircraft, American vertical-takeoff transport planes whose introduction last year to a Marine airfield on Okinawa set off protests. The Osprey can fly farther and faster than Japan’s current helicopters, allowing its troops to more easily reach the disputed islands, known as the Senkaku in Japan and Diaoyu in China.Despite a decade of defense cuts, analysts said Japan last year had the world’s sixth-largest military budget, spending 4.65 trillion yen, or $53.3 billion, on defense. Japan has one of the largest and most advanced militaries in Asia, though it has kept a low profile to avoid stirring bitter memories of its early-20th-century empire building.Mr. Abe’s efforts to raise Japan’s military profile in the region are intended not only to bolster his nation’s declining influence, but also to help an economically ailing ally, the United States, counter China’s rising military prowess."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/us/politics/obama-nominates-hagel-for-defense-post.html,"WASHINGTON — In his effusive endorsement of Chuck Hagel as his choice for secretary of defense on Monday, President Obama set in motion a White House campaign that officials predict will overcome weeks of accusations that the Republican former senator from Nebraska is anti-Israel, antigay and soft on Iran.The president extolled Mr. Hagel’s record as a decorated veteran of the Vietnam War, saying that he was “the leader that our troops deserve.” He described how Mr. Hagel once saved his brother, who was fighting alongside him, after he was wounded by a mine.“With Chuck, our troops will always know, just as Sergeant Hagel was there for his own brother, Secretary Hagel will be there for you,” said Mr. Obama, who was flanked by Mr. Hagel and the departing defense secretary, Leon E. Panetta, at the White House ceremony.“Maybe most importantly,” the president continued, “Chuck knows that war is not an abstraction. He understands that sending young Americans to fight and bleed in the dirt and mud, that’s something we do only when it’s absolutely necessary.”The president’s message seemed intended in particular for the conservative critics of Mr. Hagel, including Senator John McCain of Arizona, who have warned that he will face a bruising confirmation battle. White House officials said that Republicans, whatever their policy disagreements, would find it difficult to vote against an acknowledged war hero.Mr. Obama’s announcement was part of a carefully calibrated White House strategy that has included reaching out to pro-Israel lobbying groups, with a goal of wearing down the resistance to Mr. Hagel that erupted as soon as he emerged last month as a front-runner for the Pentagon post.Conservative and Jewish groups reiterated their concerns on Monday that Mr. Hagel has opposed sanctions on Iran, failed to support Israel, and has advocated engaging with Hamas and Hezbollah. They want him to explain why he once referred to pro-Israel lobbying groups as “the Jewish lobby,” a phrase they said was hurtful to Jews.Still, it was not clear how hard they will fight to block Mr. Hagel, now that the president has nominated him. “We’re not in the opposition camp, we’re in the concerned camp,” said David Harris, the executive director of the American Jewish Committee, a centrist Jewish group. “We’re going to count on the Senate to examine, as it must, key issues of concern.”Republican and some Democratic senators predict Mr. Hagel will still face tough questions about his views on Israel, Iran, and negotiating with Islamic militants. He has also faced criticism from gay rights organizations because of remarks he made 14 years ago — for which he has since apologized — about an openly gay diplomat.In a statement, Mr. McCain, a Vietnam veteran like Mr. Hagel who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said, “I have serious concerns about positions Senator Hagel has taken on a range of critical national security issues in recent years.” But he added, “Chuck Hagel served our nation with honor in Vietnam.”The White House is working behind the scenes to mollify other potential critics. Administration officials said Mr. Obama’s chief of staff, Jacob J. Lew, called Howard Kohr, the executive director of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most influential pro-Israel lobbying groups.A spokesman for Aipac, Marshall Wittmann, said the group did not take a position on presidential nominations.Mr. Harris, of the American Jewish Committee, said Iran topped his list of concerns about Mr. Hagel because the senator voted against unilateral American sanctions against the Iranian government over its nuclear program and had argued against using the threat of military force to prevent Tehran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.Abraham H. Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League, said the senators should challenge Mr. Hagel on his positions on Israel and Iran, which he said were “so out of sync” with those of the president.On Monday, White House officials rounded up examples of what they said showed the hypocrisy of the senator’s critics. In e-mails to reporters, they noted that Dick Cheney, the Republican former vice president; television news networks; and The Washington Times had all used the phrase “Jewish lobby” without generating a furor.Mr. Hagel has said positive things about Israel, too, and White House officials were quick to note them. While Mr. McCain expressed “serious concerns,” officials noted that in 2006, he said Mr. Hagel would make “a great secretary of state.”The biggest gun in the White House’s armory, aside from the president, is Mr. Hagel himself. And he served notice that he would defend himself vigorously.While diplomatic in his remarks at the White House, he gave an interview to a Nebraska newspaper, published Monday, in which he complained that he had been “hanging out there in no man’s land, unable to respond to charges, falsehoods, and distortions.”“The distortions of my record have been astounding,” Mr. Hagel told The Lincoln Journal Star. He said there was “not one shred of evidence that I’m anti-Israel, not one vote that matters that hurt Israel.”Mr. Obama’s rapport with Mr. Hagel goes back to their days in the Senate. In July 2008, Mr. Hagel and Senator Jack Reed, Democrat of Rhode Island, accompanied Mr. Obama on a trip to Afghanistan that burnished Mr. Obama’s foreign policy credentials as the Democratic nominee.Like the president, Mr. Hagel is suspicious of a lingering American military presence in Afghanistan, and would most likely be comfortable with a more rapid drawdown of American troops after responsibility for security is turned over to the Afghans at the end of 2014.Mr. Obama referred obliquely to the controversy around Mr. Hagel, saying soldiers in the field were far away from the politics of Washington, but should not be handicapped by it.He urged the Senate to act promptly on Mr. Hagel’s nomination, adding, “When it comes to national security, we don’t like to leave a lot of gaps.”If confirmed, he said, Mr. Hagel, 66, would be the first former enlisted man and the first Vietnam veteran to serve as defense secretary, and one of the few ever wounded in war.John Nagl, a retired Army officer and professor of history at the Naval Academy, said Mr. Hagel talked of his combat credentials in addressing a class he was teaching at West Point. “He said: ‘I was that 19-year-old rifleman. Look me in the eye and tell me that if you send a kid to get killed, it will be for a mission that matters.’ ”“He’ll be a voice for G.I. Joe, and that’s a very valuable thing,” Mr. Nagl said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/us/politics/mccain-and-hagel-once-friends-and-now-estranged.html,"WASHINGTON — In the old days it was like a Senate buddy movie.John McCain and Chuck Hagel traveled the world together, popped into each other’s neighboring offices on Capitol Hill and played pranks. Mr. Hagel, then a Republican senator from Nebraska, dropped by one Halloween wearing a McCain mask. Mr. McCain, an Arizona Republican, liked to jokingly fire Mr. Hagel’s staff. “Pack up your desks!” he would say. As Vietnam War veterans — Mr. McCain had been a naval officer and a pilot, Mr. Hagel an enlisted infantryman — they forged an even closer bond.“John would call him sergeant — ‘Hey, Sergeant, come in, Sergeant!’ ” said Senator Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican who is Mr. McCain’s closest friend in Washington. “They would salute each other.”But as Mr. Hagel heads into contentious confirmation hearings to be President Obama’s secretary of defense, the two remain estranged over policy differences that started with the Iraq War, spread into bitter presidential politics and ultimately damaged, if not ended, a friendship. Some colleagues say the break between two stubborn iconoclasts has been exaggerated in the absolutist world of the capital, but no one disputes that the relationship has cooled dramatically.“The Iraq war is where the policy differences became pretty difficult to deal with,” said Mr. Graham, speaking of Mr. McCain’s aggressive push for the 2007 surge of American forces in Iraq and Mr. Hagel’s unsuccessful fight against that escalation. “The worldview really began to diverge.”The differences were on full display when Mr. McCain released a statement after Mr. Hagel was nominated on Monday saying he had “serious concerns” about the positions on national security Mr. Hagel had taken over the years. The two spoke the same day by phone in what an aide called a cordial conversation — one of at least 30 calls to senators Mr. Hagel has made this week in preparation for his hearing — but on Tuesday on CNN Mr. McCain had not changed his tone.While “the friendship, I hope, is still there,” Mr. McCain said, he remained worried about Mr. Hagel’s “overall attitude about the United States, our role in the world, particularly in the Middle East, and whether we should reduce the Pentagon further.”People who know both men say that at this point Mr. Hagel appears to have the votes for confirmation and that in the end Mr. McCain could well vote yes for the friend who was at his side during his unsuccessful 2000 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. But aides to both acknowledge the dynamic on Capitol Hill could change and that Mr. McCain — and others — will give Mr. Hagel a rough time. At the very least, they say, Mr. McCain remains bruised over Mr. Hagel’s decision not to support Mr. McCain when he became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, and over a trip Mr. Hagel took with Mr. Obama to Iraq the same year.“He was very angry about it,” said one of Mr. McCain’s 2008 advisers, who asked not to be identified discussing the complicated dynamics between the two. Mr. McCain “takes policy disputes very, very personally,” the adviser added. He described Mr. McCain’s current view of Mr. Hagel as one of “profound disappointment.”Mr. McCain, 76, the son and grandson of admirals, and Mr. Hagel, 66, the son of a lumberyard worker who drank heavily and died when Mr. Hagel was in high school, first became political pals in 1996, when Mr. Hagel was running for the first time for the Senate.Mr. McCain, who by then had been in the Senate nearly a decade and was nationally known, campaigned frequently for his fellow Vietnam veteran in Nebraska, much to the gratitude of Mr. Hagel and his staff. The two had similar personality traits: a sense of humor, brashness, bullheadedness and an aversion to Republican orthodoxy and hierarchy. By 2000, Mr. Hagel had returned the favor to become national co-chairman of Mr. McCain’s presidential campaign.As one of only a small band of supporters in the Senate, Mr. Hagel was a regular on the “Straight Talk Express,” Mr. McCain’s rolling campaign bus party. He exulted with Mr. McCain during his upset victory in New Hampshire, roared back at a smear campaign against Mr. McCain in South Carolina and by the end of the primaries was a broker for an uneasy peace between Mr. McCain and the Republican nominee, George W. Bush.Friends say the strains between the two began in 2002, when Mr. Hagel emerged as an early and acerbic Republican skeptic to the Bush administration’s plans for invading Iraq. Mr. Hagel voted for the resolution that authorized the invasion but rapidly became a critic of the Bush administration’s execution of the war. Mr. McCain was equally critical, but he saw the solution in an addition of more than 20,000 American troops, which Mr. Hagel opposed.“This is a Ping-Pong game with American lives,” Mr. Hagel told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in January 2007. “And we better be damn sure we know what we’re doing, all of us, before we put 22,000 more Americans into that grinder.”Mr. McCain saw Mr. Hagel’s views as wrongly colored by the brutal combat he saw as an infantryman in the jungles of Vietnam, where he was wounded twice. (Mr. McCain was shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and for the next five years was imprisoned and tortured by the North Vietnamese.) “I think he was very haunted by Vietnam,” Mr. Graham said of Mr. Hagel. Mr. McCain, he said, “doesn’t look at every conflict through the eyes of his Vietnam experience — you know, ‘We shouldn’t have been there, it went on too long, we didn’t have a plan.’ Fighting Al Qaeda is not fighting in Vietnam.”Some former staff members insist that Iraq was not the divisive force between the two men that it has been made out to be and that they naturally drifted apart when Mr. McCain began campaigning again for president in 2007 and spent less time in Washington. Mr. Hagel left the Senate at the end of 2008.“Although McCain disagreed with Hagel’s position, he never resented him for it,” Mark Salter, Mr. McCain’s former chief of staff and a top adviser in the 2008 campaign, wrote on the Web site RealClearPolitics this week, referring to the differences over the surge. The two just stopped socializing, he said, for no discernible reason.“Not everything that happens in Washington fits into a neat narrative or affects history,” Mr. Salter wrote. “Sometimes it’s just another unremarkable occasion when people go their own way for their own quirky reasons.”Others hold out the possibility of a rapprochement, however remote. “You have two guys who are hurt, and you know how guys are, they don’t make up unless there’s a woman around who forces them,” said one of Mr. Hagel’s former staff members who did not want to be identified discussing the conflict. “They would rather be friends than not, I’m quite certain of that.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/opinion/senator-reid-takes-fresh-aim.html,"During a tight re-election campaign in 2010, when the vote of gun owners was crucial, Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader of the Senate, not only showed his prowess with a 12-gauge shotgun — hitting two clay pigeons from the air — but also invited Wayne LaPierre, chief executive officer of the National Rifle Association, as his guest for the opening of a new shooting range in Searchlight, Nev. Mr. Reid, a former policeman, eagerly displayed his sportsman’s enthusiasm to the voters.It turned out his solidarity with the N.R.A. extended to quietly inserting an amendment that year into President Obama’s health care reform law that restricted the ability of physicians to gather data about their patients’ use of firearms.The provision, reported last month in The Washington Post, reflected the N.R.A.’s long-running obsession with preventing gun-related deaths and injuries from being studied as a major public health problem that should be controlled the way government monitors risks connected to automobiles, airplanes and consumer products. For decades, lawmakers have let the gun lobby block financing for and limit gun research by the National Institutes of Health and other agencies.Mr. Reid’s office insisted the amendment was intended to head off N.R.A. opposition to health care reform. In any case, mass shootings as a public health threat should be a major part of the debate over gun reform taking shape after the massacre of schoolchildren and teachers in Newtown, Conn. An adviser to Mr. Reid, who will be at the center of any Senate action, told CNN that the senator is now “in a different place” on the gun control issue.Let’s hope so. After the shooting deaths of 12 moviegoers and the wounding of 58 others in a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last July, Senator Reid said there was too little time on the Senate calendar to take up the issue of gun restrictions. But after the Newtown shootings he grieved for the dead and conceded, “We need to accept the reality that we are not doing enough to protect our citizens.” Congress must examine how to prevent more gun tragedies, he said, stressing that “every idea should be on the table.”Mr. Reid must be held to nothing less as his friends in the N.R.A. mount their ferocious campaign against effective reform. A significant part of the gun lobby’s supporters on Capitol Hill are Democrats. As their leader, Harry Reid will be crucial in making genuine change happen, and he will share the blame if it does not."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/world/asia/sri-lankan-parliament-impeaches-chief-justice.html,"NEW DELHI — Defying a court order, Sri Lanka’s Parliament voted overwhelmingly on Friday to impeach the nation’s chief justice, a significant step in a worsening showdown between the legislature and the judiciary that has alarmed democracy advocates and many foreign governments.President Mahinda Rajapaksa must now decide whether he is willing to take the last step in the impeachment process and dismiss Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake of the Supreme Court, who was seen as a Rajapaksa loyalist until September, when the court struck down provisions of a law that would have given greater power to the government’s economic development minister, Basil Rajapaksa, who is also the president’s brother.The chief justice’s fall from grace since that ruling has been dizzying, with the state-controlled media sharply criticizing her. Impeachment proceedings began in November.A parliamentary committee  issued a guilty verdict against her in December, saying she had misused her power and failed to adequately declare her assets. Last week, an appeals court annulled the verdict and forbade further action by the Parliament against Chief Justice Bandaranayake.The Parliament’s willingness to ignore the court’s ruling and impeach the chief justice anyway set the nation up for a possible constitutional crisis. Saliya Peiris, a lawyer for Chief Justice Bandaranayake, told The Associated Press that his client would not recognize the impeachment and that her next step would be announced later.Since President Rajapaksa dominates the Parliament, the impeachment effort is widely seen by many democracy advocates as an effort by the president and his family to further consolidate power and eliminate any impediment to their almost complete control.“The entire impeachment process is clearly politically motivated as a punishment to the chief justice for daring to apply the constitution in a way that went against the Rajapaksa administration,” Alan Keenan, of the International Crisis Group, said in an interview.The parliamentary committee found Chief Justice Bandaranayake unfit for office on charges of failing to disclose details of 20 bank accounts and intervening in cases before the court in which she had a financial interest. She was also alleged to have sought to protect her husband from corruption charges.She had protested the rapidity of the parliamentary proceeding and her inability to confront or cross-examine her accusers.Lawmakers voted 155 to 49 on Friday to impeach.On Wednesday, Victoria Nuland, the United States State Department spokeswoman, said that the department had “serious concerns about the actions that were taken to impeach the chief justice” and that the proceedings raised “serious questions about the process and government pressure on the judiciary.”The United States Embassy in Colombo released a statement Friday repeating those concerns.“This impeachment calls into question issues about the separation of powers in Sri Lanka and the impact of its absence on democratic institutions,” it said in a statement.President Rajapaksa and his brothers are widely credited with ending one of the world’s longest and bloodiest civil wars in 2009 by defeating the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. The war’s end brought stability to much of the country and has increased opportunities for tourism. But he and his brothers have been accused of being involved in unlawful killings by security forces and government-allied paramilitary groups, and a United Nations panel ruled that accusations against the Sri Lankan government of war crimes were credible and should be investigated."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/us/politics/fund-raising-lags-for-inaugural-events.html,"President Obama’s inaugural committee is at least $10 million short of its $50 million fund-raising goal, officials have told top donors, with just over a week before Mr. Obama is sworn in for his second term.The shortfall was revealed in a conference call on Thursday afternoon with members of the inaugural finance committee, and it may be even larger.Some donors and lobbyists involved in the effort said that the committee has raised just $30 million for the Jan. 21 celebration, though inaugural officials said that figure was outdated.The committee is particularly struggling to bring in corporate money after Mr. Obama’s announcement last month that he would accept contributions from businesses, a change from his position in 2009. A list of donors posted by the Presidential Inaugural Committee on Jan. 4 includes just a handful of business donors.Even more striking, those involved in the planning said, was the absence of the vast majority of top fund-raisers for Mr. Obama’s campaign, which raised over a billion dollars.Aides to Mr. Obama believe they are still on track to make their budget.More corporate donors and more of Mr. Obama’s longtime supporters were expected to appear on an updated list that was to be published on Friday.But the difficulties reflect both the exhaustion of donors after Mr. Obama’s record-breaking re-election campaign and leftover tensions with the business community, with which the administration has sometimes clashed. Some people involved in planning inauguration events said they believed that businesses were unwilling to contribute because they did not want to be associated with Washington after the contentious debate over the fiscal crisis.But Mr. Obama’s team is also butting heads with longtime allies, pushing many of them to make contribute even more now in order to qualify for the top-tier inaugural packages.In some cases, the donors have already raised millions of dollars for Mr. Obama and say they believe they have already earned the right to attend the events.The packages — each named after a former president — include access to the inauguration’s parade of exclusive receptions and other events.Some donors will be allowed to accompany Mr. Obama and other elected officials on the viewing stand where the president will watch the inauguration parade.Others may attend a “candlelight reception” at the National Building Museum, where a photo reception with the president, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., and their wives will cost as much as $100,000.Donors, for their part, have also pressured Mr. Obama’s aides to offer firmed-up schedules so that they can plan their travel, challenging a staff that has roughly five weeks to orchestrate an elaborate sequence of concerts, volunteering events and parties.One preliminary list of events, sent to members of Mr. Obama’s finance team by Sam Brown, a senior inaugural official, included a wry note: “This is outrageously subject to change, but something to placate the vultures.”The drive for money has led to some frustration on both sides amid continued wrangling over donations and access. Donors and aides are negotiating the price of tickets to exclusive events and other benefits.And the campaign is still rolling out new offers, including a “Daily Deal” e-mailed to top donors.One recent Daily Deal featured two front-row seats at the “Kid’s Inaugural,” headlined by the pop singer Katy Perry. (Some donors were annoyed when tickets to the event were pulled from one of the inauguration packages after a venue change left fewer seats available.)The administration has planned a more modest array of events this time around, reflecting a less jubilant public mood than four years ago and diminished demand among Obama supporters.But while some events, like the inaugural ball on the night of Jan. 21, have sold out quickly, others have done a less brisk business, leading Mr. Obama’s team to discount some packages and offer new ones at relatively low prices.In an e-mail to top donors on Monday, Rufus Gifford, Mr. Obama’s finance director, announced a “Monroe Package” for $7,500.“I’d like to extend my sincere thanks for your incredible effort over the past two years to help the campaign,” Mr. Gifford wrote. “You’re among the first to know about the Monroe Package, specifically put together for major supporters like yourself. I have personally customized this package to include preferred tickets to all of Monday’s festivities, including two V.I.P. tickets to the Inaugural Parade, and two tickets to the Official Inaugural Ball in the Premium Section.”"

Kenen, the organization was referred to by everyone in the Jewish community as “the Jewish lobby for Israel.” And to this day, Jewish establishment organizations constitute virtually Aipac’s entire organizational membership.The suggestion by some senators and conservative groups opposed to former Senator Chuck Hagel’s nomination as defense secretary that his reference to Aipac as “the Jewish lobby” is “hurtful to Jews,” as reported in a Jan. 8 news article, is not only untrue but also a cynical exploitation of the issue of anti-Semitism for the narrowest political purposes.That said, “the Jewish lobby” may indeed be the wrong name for Aipac and its satellites. Senator Hagel’s skepticism of military solutions to all problems resonates far more authentically prophetic Jewish values than the reflexive support offered by the Israel lobby to the most extreme militaristic policies of this Israeli government.HENRY SIEGMANPresident, U.S.-Middle East ProjectNew York, Jan. 8, 2013"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/us/politics/gun-control-group-urges-expanded-background-checks.html,"WASHINGTON — The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, one of the nation’s leading gun control groups, said on Friday that it wanted the White House to focus its attention on expanded background checks for gun buyers as part of a broad push to reduce gun violence in the wake of the school attack in Connecticut last month.The group made the recommendations this week to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and plans to release them publicly Friday afternoon. The Times obtained a copy of the document, which stresses that “closing the massive hole in the background check” system is the group’s top policy priority.“Calling it a ‘gun show loophole’ trivializes the problem,” the document provided to Mr. Biden says. “Universal background checks on all gun sales would have a clear positive impact on public safety, and is also clearly compatible with the rights of law-abiding citizens to own guns.”Dan Gross, the group’s president, said he and other advocates still feel strongly about the need to limit the availability of military-style assault weapons. The group said in its recommendations to Mr. Biden that any proposals should find ways to “limit the availability of military-style weapons and high-capacity ammunition that are designed for mass killing.”But Mr. Gross said that the group does not want a debate that focuses primarily on a possible ban of assault weapons.“We’re not rating any solution as bigger or more important than the other. But it’s vitally important that the conversation be broader than just an assault ban,” Mr. Gross said. “Background checks clearly stake out a middle ground that can save lives.An even stronger message comes from Third Way, a left-leaning research group in Washington D.C., that has long advocated for stronger gun control laws. Matt Bennett, the vice president for public affairs at Third Way, said Friday that President Obama should not get into a knock-down fight with the National Rifle Association over an assault-weapons ban.“The assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden Task Force is considering,” Mr. Bennett said. “Political capital in the gun debate only goes so far. We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.”The caution about the politics of fighting for an assault-weapons ban from some advocacy groups comes as Mr. Biden signaled his interest in focusing on other parts of the gun debate. In public comments Friday, Mr. Biden did not mention the idea of a gun ban.The White House says President Obama still supports a ban on assault weapons and fully intends to propose and fight for one as part of a broader package of changes. But they acknowledge that the political fight will be difficult, especially in the Republican-controlled House.Some advocacy organizations are still pushing for a sustained effort to revive the assault-weapons ban, which was initially imposed in 1994 and expired a decade later. But Mr. Bennett said his group was concerned that a prolonged and difficult fight with the N.R.A. over such a ban would make it more difficult to achieve the other parts of the plan.“While they won’t admit it, the N.R.A. probably wants the A.W.B. fight,” Mr. Bennett said, “because it will dominate the debate, drive away some moderate members of Congress, and put the focus on a gun ban, rather than their outrageous and indefensible opposition to background checks, a modern gun trafficking law, and the use of gun violence data by law enforcement.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/us/politics/rockefeller-will-leave-senate-after-five-terms.html,"WASHINGTON — Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, a longtime liberal voice in Congress, announced on Friday that he would not seek a sixth term in 2014, providing an opening for Republicans to cut into the Democratic Senate majority.The decision by Mr. Rockefeller, 75, who also served two terms as governor of West Virginia, was no surprise and came after he gave a Senate floor speech last June that angered the state’s politically influential coal industry. He is the first incumbent to announce he will not run in a challenging election cycle for Democrats who will be defending a seat not only in conservative West Virginia but in Republican-leaning states like Alaska, Arkansas, Louisiana and Montana.Mr. Rockefeller would have faced his stiffest challenge since joining the Senate in 1985. Representative Shelley Moore Capito, a seven-term Republican, had announced her intention to challenge Mr. Rockefeller, and his retirement could spur more interest.Speaking in Charleston, W.Va., with his wife, Sharon, at his side, Mr. Rockefeller said his decision to retire was not an easy one.“As I approach 50 years of public service in West Virginia, I’ve decided that 2014 will be the right moment for me to find new ways to fight for the causes I believe in and to spend more time with my incredible family,” said the senator, who is chairman of the Commerce Committee and has played a critical role in fights to expand health care coverage. “For the next two years in the Senate, and well beyond, I will continue working tirelessly on behalf of all West Virginians. Championing those most in need has been my life’s calling, and I will never stop fighting to make a difference for the people who mean so much to me.”The departure of Mr. Rockefeller, a great-grandson of John D. Rockefeller, the oil tycoon, will unofficially bring to a close the tradition of dynastic reigns of powerful American families shaping public policy. When Representative Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island left the House in 2011 shortly after the death of his father, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Congress did not have a member of the Kennedy clan for the first time in six decades. However, this month, Joseph P. Kennedy III, grandson of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, was sworn in as a new congressman from Massachusetts.Ms. Capito is the favored choice of many Republicans in West Virginia, though some conservatives have questioned her candidacy. She also comes from a political family. Her father, Arch A. Moore Jr., is a former governor of West Virginia, and a former rival of Mr. Rockefeller. In 1972, he beat Mr. Rockefeller in the governor’s race, only to lose to him in a rematch eight years later.West Virginia, with its deep Democratic past, has not been represented by a Republican in the Senate since the late 1950s. While the state has increasingly trended Republican — President Obama did not carry a single county in the state — its other senator, Joe Manchin III, and Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin are both Democrats. Still, Republicans see a prime opportunity.“Senator Rockefeller’s decision not to seek re-election makes West Virginia an even stronger pickup opportunity for Republicans in 2014,” said Rob Collins, executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee. “Voters next year will have a clear choice between a Democrat who will be a loyal vote for President Obama and Harry Reid as they try to kill West Virginia’s coal industry and bankrupt our country with reckless government spending, versus a Republican who will serve as an effective check-and-balance on their liberal agenda and work to get our country’s economy back on track.”But Democrats, who had a very successful 2012 election cycle, said they would retain Mr. Rockefeller’s seat.“While we will greatly miss him in our caucus, I am confident we can elect an independent-minded Democrat to his seat,” said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, head of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “Democrats maintain nearly a 2-to-1 voter registration advantage over Republicans in West Virginia, and I know there are a number of leaders there who will consider taking this next step to serve their state.”With the issue of gun control gaining increasing national prominence and likely to be an issue in 2014, the success of the Democrats here will hinge in part on Mr. Manchin and his willingness to fight hard for the seat.The idea that Mr. Rockefeller, who has had health problems in recent years, would not seek a sixth term became widespread last June when he gave a Senate speech opposing Republican attempts to prevent regulation on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants. The speech prompted outrage from business interests in West Virginia, a state that relies heavily on coal. At the time, Mr. Rockefeller warned that the coal industry needed to “face reality,” arguing that they “would rather attack false enemies and deny real problems than find solutions.”Mr. Rockefeller’s service as a Vista volunteer brought him to West Virginia in 1964 after graduating from Harvard University in 1961, where he made his home and quickly began his career in public service, joining the state’s House of Delegates in 1966. He championed liberal causes, supporting President Bill Clinton’s thwarted attempt at near-universal health insurance coverage and Mr. Obama’s successful Affordable Care Act nearly 20 years later."

Booker of Newark has taken his first official step toward running for the United States Senate in 2014.Mr. Booker, who had announced his interest in pursuing the seat long held by a fellow Democrat, Frank R.

Representative Frank Pallone Jr. has been making calls to county party leaders and other important Democrats to shore up support. Stephen M. Sweeney, the State Senate president, and Sheila Y. Oliver, the speaker of the State Assembly, have also expressed interest in running.Mr. Booker, who is in his second term as mayor, kept the New Jersey political establishment waiting in the fall as he weighed whether to challenge Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, whose popularity soared after Hurricane Sandy.A Booker-Christie race, for one of only two governor’s seats open across the country this year, would have automatically attracted national attention. But shortly before Christmas, Mr. Booker announced that he would focus on a Senate bid instead."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/us/politics/democrats-urge-obama-to-take-any-lawful-steps-to-avoid-default.html,"WASHINGTON — The Democratic leadership in the Senate asked President Obama on Friday to take “any lawful steps” available to avoid a default on the nation’s debt if Republicans continue to press their demand that an increase in the government’s borrowing limit be accompanied by spending cuts of the same magnitude.“In the event that Republicans make good on their threat by failing to act, or by moving unilaterally to pass a debt-limit extension only as part of unbalanced or unreasonable legislation, we believe you must be willing to take any lawful steps to ensure that America does not break its promises and trigger a global economic crisis — without Congressional approval, if necessary,” wrote Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington.The letter signaled an escalation in the war of words over the federal debt ceiling, which has already technically been breached, leaving the Treasury Department scrambling to meet the government’s domestic and foreign obligations. Lawmakers believe the bookkeeping flexibility will be exhausted by Feb. 15, at which time Washington would have to either default on its debt or shut down major expenditures.Already, liberal policy experts have been trying to rally support for measures to go around the Republican blockade, from declaring that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment gives the president unilateral authority to raise the debt ceiling to calling for the minting of a trillion-dollar platinum coin that would be used to pay the nation’s debts.“All Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, have a stake in ensuring that our country meets its legal obligations,” the Democratic leaders wrote. “Financial markets have long viewed securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States as the most trustworthy in the world. This lowers borrowing costs for homes, cars, and college for all Americans and strengthens our economy. If we violate that trust for the first time in history, we will never fully regain it, and every American will suffer.”Mr. Obama has said he will not negotiate on raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit, but without some extralegal maneuver, it is not clear how he can keep that promise. The House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, has not backed down on his demand that any increase in the debt limit include cuts at least equal in scope, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has also said the debt ceiling issue must be used to secure spending reductions.“Senate Democrats cannot ignore their responsibilities for political convenience — and the American people will not tolerate an increase in the debt limit without spending cuts and reforms,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner.Conservative Republicans say that even without an increase in the debt ceiling, the administration could continue to pay foreign and domestic creditors by ensuring that incoming tax receipts go first to paying off debts. To do that, however, huge and immediate cuts in government spending would be necessary, and global financial markets would almost certainly be rattled.The Senate Democratic leaders did not suggest what “lawful steps” they had in mind. A Democratic aide said the senators would be inclined to have the president declare unilateral authority under the 14th Amendment, which says the debt’s validity “shall not be questioned.”That, the aide said, would be more politically tenable than using the loophole of a trillion-dollar coin, issued under a legal provision that allows the Treasury to mint a platinum coin of any denomination. The coin would be deposited at the Federal Reserve, which in theory would then issue a line of credit against it.But Democrats worry that the coin option would baffle voters. According to officials familiar with the drafting of the letter, top aides to Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, initially favored an explicit reference to the 14th Amendment. But in negotiations over the wording of their letter, the leaders opted for strategic ambiguity, to keep Republicans guessing and the president’s options open.One of the main reasons for the letter was to bolster the president’s resolve, Senate aides said. In 2011, Mr. Obama dismissed the 14th Amendment option, telling reporters that his lawyers “are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.” This week when asked about the coin, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said, “There is no Plan B, there is no backup plan. There is Congress’s responsibility to pay the bills of the United States.”Democratic leadership aides said the Senate would probably take up legislation in early February that would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling on his own in set increments, perhaps of $1 trillion. Congress would have the ability to reject the increase, but that would take a two-thirds majority.That plan was first used at the suggestion of Senator McConnell in 2011 to solve the last debt-ceiling impasse. Late last year, Mr. McConnell proposed it on the Senate floor again, but when Democrats called his bluff, he reversed course and blocked his own proposal."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/opinion/new-yorks-pension-muscle.html,"When the United States Supreme Court issued its flawed 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, unleashing millions of dollars in corporate spending on political campaigns, there seemed to be one small prescription for relief. Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, noted that prompt disclosure of political expenditures would allow stockholders and citizens to hold corporations accountable. Shareholders, he said, could determine whether the corporation’s financing of campaigns “advances the corporation’s interest in making profits.”New York State’s comptroller, Thomas DiNapoli, is attempting to do just that. As sole guardian of investments for New York’s $150 billion pension fund, he wants to use his considerable financial clout to get a major company to open its books to shareholders, including New York State.Last week, Mr. DiNapoli sued Qualcomm, a computer chip business, demanding to see the company’s internal records on political spending. The suit, filed in Delaware, where the company is incorporated, argues that the records are necessary to help Mr. DiNapoli determine whether the state’s pension funds are protected. “Without disclosure, there is no way to know whether corporate funds are being used in ways that go against shareholder interests,” he said.The pension fund owns almost $380 million in Qualcomm stock, and Mr. DiNapoli contends that this should give him a voice in the company’s business. Delaware law gives shareholders the right to inspect books and records of a corporation for “a proper purpose.” Determining whether political spending is a wise use of corporate money, Mr. DiNapoli argues, meets that test. If the courts agree, governments and stockholders will have acquired a valuable new tool for holding corporations accountable for political spending.Mr. DiNapoli’s suit is one of many efforts nationwide by pension funds and other institutional investors to force corporations to disclose or limit their political contributions. The New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, is also seeking greater transparency on political spending from many nonprofit groups.It is bad enough that the flow of political money into American campaigns grows bigger by the year — the 2012 elections were the costliest ever. It’s even worse when the public is to be kept in the dark about who’s doing the spending. Big stockholders like New York’s pension funds can bring much-needed openness to a murky process."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/business/mutfund/mutual-funds-found-big-2012-gains-despite-political-worry.html,"ECONOMIC growth remained sluggish and politics often intruded on the markets, yet stocks achieved solid returns last year all the same. It wasn’t the first time that investors scaled a wall of worry, but it might be the only instance when the main source of concern, at least in the fourth quarter, was thought to be a cliff.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 13.4 percent for the year, even with a 1 percent decline in the fourth quarter. In those last months, doubts rose about whether Congress and President Obama could reach an agreement on taxes and spending in time to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff — and the recession that was thought to lie below.The drama in Washington was one of several throughout the year that kept investors focused more on capitols than corporate boardrooms. European leaders were continually devising plans to rescue the euro and some of the economies that use it, and China underwent a change of leadership.Although the fourth-quarter loss was worse soon after Election Day and stocks raced ahead at the start of the new year, investors’ concerns may yet prove well founded. The immediate concerns related to taxes were resolved only at the 11th hour — just past midnight, really — and much remains to be sorted out on spending. Investment advisers said that politics, at home and abroad, would continue to guide markets.“The political environment and uncertainty revolving around policy decisions has been a really big factor,” said Jeremy DeGroot, chief investment officer of the fund provider Litman Gregory. “There are significant deficit issues that developed economies are facing, and the markets are hanging on every development.”One bit of uncertainty was eliminated on Jan. 1, when Congress agreed to limit the scope of scheduled tax increases, although the deal still resulted in higher tax rates on payrolls, dividends and capital gains.Worries also abated when European Union finance ministers agreed in the fourth quarter to place big banks under the supervision of the European Central Bank. That followed the bank’s announcement that it would support the bond markets of weaker economies, which are concentrated along the region’s southern periphery.THE moves on both sides of the Atlantic helped stock funds achieve modest fourth-quarter gains. The average domestic fund in Morningstar’s database rose 0.9 percent. International funds fared better, up 4.8 percent, on average, with portfolios that focus on European stocks returning 7.4 percent and emerging-market funds rising 6.2 percent. Full-year returns exceeded 14 percent for all four categories.Yields on short- and long-term debt remained low all year as the Federal Reserve and other central banks maintained the easy monetary policies in force since the 2008 crisis. While that could account for much of stocks’ strength during 2012, the influence on bond returns, at least on high-quality government issues, may be waning.The average bond fund rose a healthy 8.4 percent on the year, but the fourth-quarter gain was a slim 1.3 percent, dragged lower by a 1.1 percent loss for portfolios of long-term government bonds. High-yield bond funds rose 3.1 percent for the quarter, on average, and funds that specialize in debt issued in emerging economies gained 3.9 percent.Just how helpful low interest rates were for economic growth is hard to discern. American economic output has continued to expand at a sluggish pace. And Europe is widely seen to be in recession.“The trend of deterioration in Europe is not slowing down,” said Virginie Maisonneuve, head of global and international equities at Schroder Investment Management. She noted, though, that some indicators suggested that conditions were stabilizing at very low levels along the continent’s troubled southern fringe.Whatever the economic impact of low interest rates, they seem to be helping corporate America. Corporate debt issuance last year exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.Increased indebtedness provides leverage that lifts profit margins, said Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of the fund management company GMO. Margins have reached record levels as a proportion of economic output and are “weirdly high,” in his opinion, “unless we’re in one of those wonderful secular shifts that people talk about but almost never see.” He doesn’t glimpse any such new normal, however, and cites high margins as a reason to be cautious about most stocks.Rising debt of another kind is a pressing concern for many investors. With the national debt above $16 trillion, the second part of the fiscal cliff debate, focusing on spending cuts, is expected to be played out over the next month or so in Washington.This could have higher stakes for the economy and markets and cause more acrimony than the haggling over tax rates. That’s because the debt ceiling — the limit imposed by Congress on the government’s borrowing authority — has been reached again. The concern is that Republicans will withhold approval to raise the ceiling without meaningful spending cuts. A similar battle in 2011 led to a downgrade of Treasury debt and was the catalyst for a violent stock market decline.“We know there’s going to be another fight around the debt ceiling in February,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. “We avoided plummeting off the cliff, but we haven’t avoided more cliffs in the future.”THE immediate outlook for financial markets depends on how the next cliff is navigated. An overhaul of programs like Social Security and Medicare, combined with a revamping of the tax code in a so-called grand bargain, would set spending on a gentler slope for the long term without abrupt cuts now, investment advisers said. But some, like Mr. DeGroot, were not holding their breath.“We have to have a credible medium- to long-term plan to bring down the excess of spending over revenues, but politicians are usually not ones to make those tough decisions until they’re forced to,” he said. “It usually takes a market disruption to force their hand. Kicking the can is an easier, less painful approach. At some point, do investors say they don’t see a resolution to this?”Mr. DeGroot finds little to recommend to investors, though he does see opportunity in foreign stocks, particularly in emerging economies. Better still, he said, are so-called unconstrained bond funds whose managers have great flexibility in how they invest.Mr. Grantham also finds emerging stock markets appealing, along with Japan and “cheap European value stocks,” and he advises longer-term investors to consider commodity and energy stocks. As for the United States, he judges the market overvalued and recommends only high-quality companies.Sometimes, all it takes to do better is to avoid doing worse. Ms. Maisonneuve said investors in Europe, for example, had begun to recognize that if the region “is leaving behind its near-death experience, then equity valuations are very attractive, compared to fixed income.” A recovery in Chinese and American growth could help Europe “continue to heal itself,” she added.As for sectors, she particularly favors global health care, which can profit from drug sales to emerging economies, and cyclical industrial companies and commodity providers that would benefit from resurgent Chinese growth. She also likes financial service companies but is avoiding European banks.Investors fixated last year on so-called tail risks, or potential negative surprises. But what if 2013 offered some head risks? Such positive surprises wouldn’t faze Francis Scotland, director of global macro research at Brandywine Global.“I think people are looking in the wrong direction,” Mr. Scotland said. “There is a risk that something might actually go right. I think we’re in a sweet spot. Let’s assume we take most of the sting out of the fiscal cliff. Just the clarity will improve the corporate sector outlook. There’s a real case for the economy to grow above trend in the first half. It’s time to move to a more risk-oriented strategy.”While he is happy to advocate for the American economy and likes domestic market sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, Mr. Scotland prefers to take risks elsewhere. He recommends bonds in peripheral European countries like Italy and Ireland; investment-grade emerging bond markets like Mexico, Poland and South Africa; and Japanese, Chinese and European stocks.“You could make a case for all of these markets doing well, relative to the U.S.,” he said.MR. LEVKOVICH makes the case for American stocks doing well. He says he expects the S. &P. 500 to rise 13 percent this year, to 1,615. He agrees with Mr. Scotland that “there’s a bunch of good news out there.”“Housing has improved, and job trends should improve based on surveys and credit growth,” Mr. Levkovich said. “There’s an energy boom in places like Montana and South Dakota that is growing more jobs, and manufacturing competitiveness is developing in this country; it’s cheaper to build a plant and produce goods in South Carolina than in Shenzhen.”Even though he is hopeful about 2013, Mr. Levkovich acknowledged that investors might want to wait until Washington produced a deal that averts the next fiscal cliff before they focus on the more pleasant landscape beyond it.“We’ve got this positive dynamic,” he said. “The biggest constraint we’re facing is the fiscal issue and dysfunctional government.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/business/paying-the-price-in-settlements-but-often-deducting-it.html,"THE numbers seem eye-popping. So many billions here for supposed mortgage abuses, so many billions there for questionable foreclosures.But there’s more than meets the eye to the big legal settlements you’ve been reading about involving some of the nation’s biggest banks.Actually, there’s less than meets the eye.The dollar signs are big, but they aren’t as big as they look, at least for the banks. That’s because some or all of these payments will probably be tax-deductible. The banks can claim them as business expenses. Taxpayers, therefore, will likely lighten the banks’ loads.There is nothing new about corporations reaping tax benefits from payments made to remedy wrongdoing. Every so often, though, the topic stirs outrage. After the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, for example, BP received a $10 billion tax windfall by writing off $37.2 billion in cleanup expenses.With multibillion-dollar mortgage settlements making headlines this year and last, the question has come to the fore again. Why should taxpayers subsidize corporations that are paying to right sometimes egregious wrongs? That is a particularly weighty question, given the urgent need for tax revenue to offset the ballooning federal budget deficit.Under federal law, money paid to settle a company’s actual or potential liability for a civil or criminal penalty is not deductible. But, this being taxes, the issue is complicated. As Robert W. Wood, a tax lawyer, said in a 2009 Tax Notes article, “The tax deduction for business expenses is broad enough to include most settlements and judgments.”In an interview last week, Mr. Wood, who is also the author of “Taxation of Damage Awards and Settlement Payments,” said the test for deductibility boils down to whether the payment is a penalty or is meant to be remedial. “I don’t know the specifics on these mortgage settlements,” he said, “but if any of the lenders are putting a bunch of money into a pot that goes to help people, yes, I would assume that everybody will deduct that.”Nevertheless, the deductibility test is not always clear. And companies naturally push hard for these tax benefits when they negotiate settlements with the government.Unfortunately, the government rarely specifies what the tax treatment of a settlement should be, leaving enforcement to the Internal Revenue Service. One exception is the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 2003, it has barred companies from deducting settlement costs as a business expense.Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, has been critical of favorable tax treatments of settlements. I asked him last week about the issue as it relates to mortgage settlements.“You can be sure the Wall Street banks consider tax consequences in negotiations and the government should, too,” he said.  “Any portion of a settlement that’s intended to be a penalty should include language clarifying it isn’t deductible. Otherwise, the government’s punishment will have less sting than intended.”IT is to be expected that corporations, like any taxpayers, will do what they can to reduce their tax bills. And a 2005 report from the Government Accountability Office suggests that tax benefits in settlements are prevalent. Examining more than $1 billion in settlements made by 34 companies, the G.A.O. found that 20 had deducted some or all of the money from their tax bills.But as Mr. Grassley suggested, the government can take deductibility off the table as an option. And occasionally it does. For example, a Justice Department spokesman said that there would be no deductibility of the $500 million penalty and fine portion of the settlement reached with UBS last month in regards to manipulation of interest rates.Certainly, a settlement’s punitive effect is lessened by any tax sweeteners it generates. Perhaps that’s why it is rarely clear from the public announcements that some or all of the settlement amounts will be deductible.Consider last week’s settlement between the government and large mortgage servicers over foreclosure abuses. Wells Fargo said in its news release that the bank would pay $766 million in cash and contribute $1.2 billion to foreclosure-prevention activities. But are those after-tax or pretax numbers? No mention was made, and a spokeswoman declined to comment other than to say that Wells Fargo “is a compliant taxpayer” that fulfills all its tax obligations.Or consider the recent settlements over soured mortgages reached by Bank of America and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are almost certainly tax-deductible, Mr. Wood said, because these are probably considered deals between private parties, even though taxpayers own Fannie and Freddie.So the deal announced last week by Bank of America to pay Fannie Mae $10.3 billion for a mortgage-related settlement, as well as the $2.62 billion in cash paid by the bank to Fannie and Freddie Mac in late 2010, probably generated, or will generate, significant tax benefits through deductions for the bank. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment.Phineas Baxandall, senior analyst for tax and budget policy at the United States Public Interest Research Group, a consumer-oriented nonprofit, and Ryan Pierannunzi, a tax and budget associate there, explored this issue in a report published last week.The report, titled “Subsidizing Bad Behavior,” details the history of the practice and suggests that government agencies should follow the S.E.C.’s lead and disallow deductibility in settlements. Barring that, the authors said, regulators should disclose only the after-tax amounts of settlements, so that people understand how much money is really being paid.In an interview last week, Mr. Baxandall noted that government agencies might not want to do that. “From the agencies’ point of view, unless the public or someone is pressuring them to do otherwise, they want a big number to tout,” he said. “Tax deductibility allows them to come out with a bigger number.”CONGRESS has tried to change this setup. In 2003, Mr. Grassley and two other senators introduced the Government Settlement Transparency Act.It would have required that payments made by companies acknowledging actual or potential violations of a law would not be tax-deductible. The legislation never passed.Bills have also been introduced in Congress that would bar deductibility on punitive damage awards arranged among private parties. Those have died, too. Past administrations have supported this idea, and the Obama administration has a proposal in its 2013 budget stating that no deduction would be allowed in such a circumstance. That proposal also states that when an existing insurance policy covered the payment of punitive damages, the amount paid would be considered income to the insured person.Not a bad idea.As settlements for corporate misdeeds pile up, perhaps it will get some traction."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/nyregion/a-review-of-satis-in-jersey-city.html,"When I first moved to New Jersey in 1987, residents of downtown Jersey City who cared about the latest trends in food did their dining in Hoboken. In 2001, Marco & Pepe opened to accommodate the growing influx of urban homesteaders, and now there are Madame Claude Cafe, the Light Horse Tavern and Thirty Acres, among other notable restaurants. There is also Satis.Michael Fiorianti, formerly a chef at Goldman Sachs, became the executive chef at Satis when it opened in December 2010. (Satis means enough in Latin, as in the word satisfied.) Now the rest of us can enjoy the dishes he mastered by observing his Italian-American grandmother in her Brooklyn kitchen and, later, celebrated chefs like Thomas Keller.I learned these facts during a telephone interview with Mr. Fiorianti after my visits, but only by tasting his pillow-soft ricotta gnocchi or lusty hanger steak can one appreciate how thoroughly he has absorbed these lessons. I ate simple dishes at Satis (bread, cured meat and cheese) and complex ones (a duck ragù entwined with stracciatella cheese), and all of them had the same effect: I wanted to move to within walking distance of Satis so that I could eat Mr. Fiorianti’s dishes every day.Other talents helped create Satis. Michael Garcia and Geza Gulas, the owners, discovered a century-old building where Eastern European immigrants who settled in the area in the early 1900s bought their bread and meat. The soaring space inspired them to create a restaurant that had at its heart a salumeria. From here, patrons can purchase cheeses and meats to go — Satis orders them from Salumeria Biellese, which also supplies Eataly in Manhattan — or they can sample them in any of three beautifully renovated dining areas.Each of these dining areas, a loft, a main room and a wine bar, is outfitted with a mix of functional accessories, like filament bulbs, and romantic ones, like swooping velvet drapes. The elegant marble bar is a copy of one that Mr. Gulas admired during a trip to his beloved Budapest, where he was born.The best way to begin a meal at Satis is with a chef’s selection of meats and cheeses. It might include Murcia al Vino, a buttery goat cheese from Spain with a wine-soaked rind; or tartufo, a peppery, spiced salame whose smoky essence is the product of fragrant black summer truffles.The bread that accompanies these items is appealingly tangy, and no wonder: it’s made using wine in the starter.The apricot confit served with the chef’s selection is the essence of ripe, summer fruit. It and every other item on the platter may tempt you to make an entire meal of bread, cheese, cured meat — and wine. The bar offers a vast selection, including 47 that you can order by the glass.Beyond the products of the salumeria are other treasures. An involtini, or delicate eggplant roll, oozes peppery La Quercia prosciutto and melted buffalo mozzarella cheese. The pâté de campagne that Mr. Fiorianti prepares from duck and pork livers exemplifies the best of country cooking: it emphasizes fat and highlights its virtues.In contrast to these heartier appetizers, the arugula salad is both ethereal, thanks to a vinaigrette that Mr. Fiorianti lightens with fennel, and seductive, a result of the extra-sharp parmigiano-reggiano he shaves onto the greens.Seductive also describes the restaurant’s signature dates wrapped in bacon — sweet, salty, smoky packets of pleasure. Everywhere you look around the candlelit space, you see people tossing these back like candy.You expect a restaurant built around a salumeria to feature perfectly cooked meats, and Satis obliges. It produces a filet mignon so rich it pops in the mouth with the lusty flavor of ripe beef, and a hanger steak with a hard crust and a silky, moist interior.But can a restaurant so devoted to beef and salami work the same magic with seafood? The creamy diver scallops, each about an inch in diameter, prove that it can.Brussels sprouts, which accompany the scallops, are also available as a side dish, afloat in a golden stew of caramelized Vidalia onions. During the weeks after I ate them, I ordered brussels sprouts in every restaurant I visited, but eventually I gave up. No place makes them like Satis. As one of my companions said, “Everything here is just better than the usual version of everything anywhere else.”Desserts include an irresistible sweet potato maple pecan cobbler, a German chocolate cake sundae and gelati in unusual flavors, like ricotta, custard and Elvis Presley (banana with a peanut butter swirl).All restaurants have flaws, but when I asked the five people who accompanied me to Satis to name any, only one person could: The baby carrots served with her hanger steak were undercooked and a little bitter.Well, maybe, but otherwise our meals were almost perfect.Satis212 Washington StreetJersey City(201) 435-5151satisbistro.comDON’T MISSTHE SPACE Functional (brick walls, filament lights) and romantic (antiques, draperies and candles).

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/is-delhi-so-different-from-steubenville.html,"IN India, a 23-year-old student takes a bus home from a movie and is gang-raped and assaulted so viciously that she dies two weeks later.In Liberia, in West Africa, an aid group called More Than Me rescues a 10-year-old orphan who has been trading oral sex for clean water to survive.In Steubenville, Ohio, high school football players are accused of repeatedly raping an unconscious 16-year-old girl who was either drunk or rendered helpless by a date-rape drug and was apparently lugged like a sack of potatoes from party to party.And in Washington, our members of Congress show their concern for sexual violence by failing to renew the Violence Against Women Act, a landmark law first passed in 1994 that has now expired.Gender violence is one of the world’s most common human rights abuses. Women worldwide ages 15 through 44 are more likely to die or be maimed because of male violence than because of cancer, malaria, war and traffic accidents combined. The World Health Organization has found that domestic and sexual violence affects 30 to 60 percent of women in most countries.In some places, rape is endemic: in South Africa, a survey found that 37 percent of men reported that they had raped a woman. In others, rape is institutionalized as sex trafficking. Everywhere, rape often puts the victim on trial: in one poll, 68 percent of Indian judges said that “provocative attire” amounts to “an invitation to rape.”Americans watched the events after the Delhi gang rape with a whiff of condescension at the barbarity there, but domestic violence and sex trafficking remain a vast problem across the United States.One obstacle is that violence against women tends to be invisible and thus not a priority. In Delhi, of 635 rape cases reported in the first 11 months of last year, only one ended in conviction. That creates an incentive for rapists to continue to rape, but in any case that reported number of rapes is delusional. They don’t include the systematized rape of sex trafficking. India has, by my reckoning, more women and girls trafficked into modern slavery than any country in the world. (China has more prostitutes, but they are more likely to sell sex by choice.)On my last trip to India, I tagged along on a raid on a brothel in Kolkata, organized by the International Justice Mission. In my column at the time, I focused on a 15-year-old and a 10-year-old imprisoned in the brothel, and mentioned a 17-year-old only in passing because I didn’t know her story.My assistant at The Times, Natalie Kitroeff, recently visited India and tracked down that young woman. It turns out that she had been trafficked as well — she was apparently drugged at a teahouse and woke up in the brothel. She said she was then forced to have sex with customers and beaten when she protested. She was never allowed outside and was never paid. What do you call what happened to those girls but slavery?Yet prosecutors and the police often shrug — or worse. Dr. Shershah Syed, a former president of the Society of Obstetricians and Gynecologists of Pakistan, once told me: “When I treat a rape victim, I always advise her not to go to the police. Because if she does, the police might just rape her again.”In the United States, the case in Steubenville has become controversial partly because of the brutishness that the young men have been accused of, but also because of concerns that the authorities protected the football team. Some people in both Delhi and Steubenville rushed to blame the victim, suggesting that she was at fault for taking a bus or going to a party. They need to think: What if that were me?The United States could help change the way the world confronts these issues. On a remote crossing of the Nepal-India border, I once met an Indian police officer who said, a bit forlornly, that he was stationed there to look for terrorists and pirated movies. He wasn’t finding any, but India posted him there to show that it was serious about American concerns regarding terrorism and intellectual property. Meanwhile, that officer ignored the steady flow of teenage Nepali girls crossing in front of him on their way to Indian brothels, because modern slavery was not perceived as an American priority.Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has done a superb job trying to put these issues on the global agenda, and I hope President Obama and Senator John Kerry will continue her efforts. But Congress has been pathetic. Not only did it fail to renew the Violence Against Women Act, but it has also stalled on the global version, the International Violence Against Women Act, which would name and shame foreign countries that tolerate gender violence.Congress even failed to renew the landmark legislation against human trafficking, the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. The obstacles were different in each case, but involved political polarization and paralysis. Can members of Congress not muster a stand on modern slavery?(Hmm. I now understand better the results of a new survey from Public Policy Polling showing that Congress, with 9 percent approval, is less popular than cockroaches, traffic jams, lice or Genghis Khan.)Skeptics fret that sexual violence is ingrained into us, making the problem hopeless. But just look at modern American history, for the rising status of women has led to substantial drops in rates of reported rape and domestic violence. Few people realize it, but Justice Department statistics suggest that the incidence of rape has fallen by three-quarters over the last four decades.Likewise, the rate at which American women are assaulted by their domestic partners has fallen by more than half in the last two decades. That reflects a revolution in attitudes. Steven Pinker, in his book “The Better Angels of Our Nature,” notes that only half of Americans polled in 1987 said that it was always wrong for a man to beat his wife with a belt or a stick; a decade later, 86 percent said it was always wrong.But the progress worldwide is far too slow. Let’s hope that India makes such violence a national priority. And maybe the rest of the world, especially our backward Congress, will appreciate that the problem isn’t just India’s but also our own."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/us/some-state-legislators-blur-line-between-public-and-private-interests.html,"On the presidential campaign trail, Gov. Rick Perry waxed eloquent about the merits of Texas’ part-time Legislature, saying that Congress would be more effective if its members had “real jobs back at home.”“We’re the 13th-largest economy in the world in Texas,” Mr. Perry said, “and we come to Austin for 140 days every other year, and it works wonderfully.”Wonderfully, it turns out, for some of those elected.Lawmakers, who are paid $7,200 per year and a per diem by taxpayers for days they spend on official business, need to make a living elsewhere, and the prestige and influence of their office can help them do it.With a conflict disclosure system rife with holes, virtually toothless ethics laws often left to the interpretation of the lawmakers they are supposed to regulate, and a Legislature that has appeared unwilling to make itself more transparent, the reality is Texans know little about who or what influences the people who are elected to represent them. They have no way to differentiate between lawmakers motivated by the interests of their constituents and those who are in it for their own enrichment.“Ostensibly, there is a defined level of disclosure and an agreed code of conduct,” said Jack Gullahorn, a Texas ethics expert who represents the state’s trade association for lobbyists. “But in general, either the sanctions aren’t there or the provisions aren’t clear enough to give people that don’t want to play by the rules any incentive to avoid the consequences for their actions.”Business TiesLawmakers routinely propose or speak on behalf of bills that benefit their professions or employers, and they serve on committees that craft laws regulating their industries. Some of them are quite open about it.Representative Gary Elkins, Republican of Jersey Village, who is in the payday lending business, took the floor during a 2011 legislative debate to push back against measures designed to help consumers stuck in a vicious cycle of high-interest loans.“I’m just a little old business guy,” Mr. Elkins said at the time, before asking his colleagues to vote no so “guys like me can comply with these laws.” Lawmakers passed the bills anyway, but included an amendment Mr. Elkins proposed to weaken one of them.Also last session, the House Insurance Committee shepherded through major reform legislation for the embattled Texas Windstorm Insurance Association, or TWIA Representative Craig Eiland, Democrat of Galveston and a lawyer who was paid hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for suing the agency on behalf of homeowners after Hurricane Ike, served as the committee’s vice chairman. TWIA, a quasi-governmental agency, is partially financed by taxpayers.Representative Todd Hunter, a Corpus Christi Republican who earned tens of thousands of dollars mediating the hurricane settlement with T.W.I.A. and was formerly the association’s lobbyist, served on the agency’s oversight committee. So did Senator Larry Taylor, a former House Republican from Friendswood and an insurance broker who has earned income selling TWIA policies.In such cases, lawmakers rely on an interpretation of the Texas Constitution that says they must bow out only if they have a “personal or private interest” in a measure —  beyond simply being a member of an affected profession.Mr. Elkins said he was so intimately tied to the payday lending industry that it would have been a disservice not to offer his expertise.Mr. Eiland, who played a central role in the debate on the TWIA reform bill, has said that he has been transparent about his legal work and that it has no bearing on his ability to represent the needs of his storm-prone coastal constituents.Both Mr. Hunter and Mr. Taylor have said that they see no conflict with their dual roles, and that they operate with the utmost legislative and professional integrity.Undisclosed ClientsThe line between lawmakers’ financial interests and their legislative efforts is not always clear. Many legislators make their living as lawyers, consultants or even lobbyists, but are not required to report their clients, even when those same clients have business at the Capitol.Senator Wendy Davis, Democrat of Fort Worth, came under fire in her closely contested re-election bid last fall for her law firm’s legal work for the North Texas Tollway Authority and for bills she supported that might have affected the agency.In March 2011, days after her law firm signed a contract with N.T.T.A., Ms. Davis withdrew support for her own bill to lower the fees that tolling authorities could charge scofflaws. She signed on to a Republican colleague’s measure that lowered the amount tolling authorities could charge drivers for their first notice of nonpayment but increased the total amount the agency could charge them over time. The bill also allowed tolling authorities to charge scofflaws third-party collection service fees. Months later, in August 2011, Ms. Davis’s firm was among six the N.T.T.A. hired to handle the agency’s collections litigation.A spokesman for N.T.T.A. said the bill did not affect the agency’s third-party collections, and that Ms. Davis’s support played no role in its decision to hire her firm. And Ms. Davis has vehemently denied that her legal clients ever guided her votes.“I’ve been very open and transparent about what it is I and my law partner do,” she told the Texas Tribune in October. “I have nothing to hide.”Yet Ms. Davis has refused to identify all of her own public-sector clients —  which include the Fort Worth Independent School District and Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport —  citing attorney-client privilege. Some of her clients have been identified through public documents, including bond records.A Helping HandIt is not just business clients who create perceived conflicts for lawmakers. Members of the Legislature sometimes use their position to aide their campaign contributors, their business associates, even their relatives.In 2008, Representative Bill Zedler, Republican of Arlington, used his legislative authority to obtain confidential records related to the Texas Medical Board’s investigations into five physicians, two of whom were not his constituents but had given a combined $25,000 to his campaign. Mr. Zedler said he believed rival physicians had wrongfully accused the doctors —  who faced allegations of performing overly invasive procedures and injecting jet fuel and natural gas into patients to diagnose chemical sensitivities.He said he requested the records so he could review them, see who was filing them, and try to defend doctors he believed had been wrongfully accused. In one case, he asked for the “immediate appeal” of a doctor’s sanction. The two doctors who contributed to his campaign were ultimately penalized for lesser violations.Mr. Zedler testified in 2009 that he had requested confidential records in the past to get the board to drop at least one case. Last session, he filed an unsuccessful bill that would have required the board to turn over complaint records directly to legislators, including the name of the person who lodged it.In 2008, Representative Yvonne Davis, Democrat of Dallas, asked the state’s Racing Commission to expedite a racetrack license she was seeking with her business partner, David Alameel, a dental clinic mogul and self-made millionaire. At the time, Ms. Davis was on the House Ways and Means Committee, which oversees the revenue the Racing Commission relies on.Ms. Davis said an ethics ruling cleared her to be involved in the deal, which eventually faltered.Representative Larry Phillips, Republican of Sherman, relied on legislative continuances — a special privilege granted to lawyer lawmakers —  to help his sister. Legislative continuances allow lawyers in the Legislature to postpone their clients’ legal proceedings for the five months every other year that they are in session.In 2011, Mr. Phillips, representing his sister, sought two continuances to delay a case against her when she was cited in Southlake for having expired license plates. Mr. Phillips’s sister eventually pleaded no contest and paid a $170 fine. Asked about the continuances, Mr. Phillips said the case was a family matter.Antiquated LawsThe problem with the state’s ethics laws, watchdogs say, is that they are vague and hard to enforce: disclosure forms are thin or incomplete, and lawmakers’ interpretation of the rules is often subjective.On personal financial forms, many lawmakers provide few details of their employment and compensation, and they skirt documenting the business interests they have in common with lobbyists. They are generally not required to name their legal or consulting clients, nor to report their personal wealth. Stocks are identified in broad, outdated ranges —  or sometimes not at all if the lawmaker’s spouse owns them.While the state’s ethics disclosure law is roughly 40 years old —  and its rules on lawmakers’ dealings with lobbyists date back more than two decades —  legislators seem disinclined to modernize the code.The Texas Ethics Commission is under “sunset” —  a review of an agency’s effectiveness — in this legislative session, a time most agencies seek to make meaningful reform. But during a summer review of staff recommendations, the Sunset Advisory Commission, a panel made up mostly of lawmakers, voted to keep legislators’ personal financial disclosures offline, sticking with unwieldy, archaic paper filings only available to those who can come to Austin to search them.The lawmakers suggested that putting the files on the Internet could threaten their privacy or lead their children to be kidnapped.A Tribune request to all members of the Legislature to provide copies of their most recent tax returns was ignored except for Representative James White, Republican of Hillister. Representative Carol Alvarado, Democrat of Houston, released hers as well, but not at the Tribune’s request; it was part of her special election run for a vacant State Senate seat.“You get the feeling, on disclosure, on enforcement, that the members of the Lege don’t really see transparency as a responsibility,” said Craig McDonald, executive director of the liberal money-in-politics group Texans for Public Justice. “They look at it as a great burden and, at times, a personal affront.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/fight-for-the-housing-trust-fund.html,"Despite the Obama administration’s best efforts, the lack of affordable housing remains one of America’s most vexing problems.A $1.5 billion transfusion in the 2009 stimulus bill managed to hold the overall homeless population about even over the last four years, and the number of people in two especially vulnerable groups — the chronically homeless and homeless veterans — has actually dropped.But with nearly 3.3 million families with children living in “worst case” situations — spending more than half their incomes on housing or living in hazardous buildings — more must be done to create affordable housing, through rehabilitation or new construction.For starters, that means finally putting money into the National Housing Trust Fund, which was created by Congress in 2008 but was never financed because of the recession. This should be an early order of business for the new Congress. The fund, modeled on successful state programs, would provide subsidies and incentives to preserve, rehabilitate and build housing, primarily for extremely low-income families that earn about 30 percent of the average median incomes in their areas, typically spend more than half their incomes on rent and are disproportionately at risk of slipping into homelessness.One of the problems with affordable housing projects generally is that they often segregate the poor. The trust fund would encourage healthy, mixed-income communities. For instance, a development of mainly market-rate apartments that set aside, say, 10 percent of the units for low-income families would receive a subsidy proportionate to that investment. In addition to creating housing for the poor within sound communities, the fund would stimulate construction of multifamily rental buildings at a time when they are greatly needed.When Congress set up the trust fund, the initial financing was supposed to come from contributions by the federally backed mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. That plan was suspended when the companies crashed. But with the two back on their feet, housing advocates are rightly pressing the Obama administration to reinstate that arrangement.Other ideas for underwriting the fund are circulating in Washington. A bill introduced by Representative Keith Ellison, Democrat of Minnesota, would turn the mortgage interest tax deduction into a tax credit aimed primarily at low- and middle-income homeowners. It would also lower the cap on mortgages that receive a tax break to $500,000 from $1.1 million. Some of the savings would be redirected to the trust fund.The administration embraced the goal of funding the trust fund as part of its 2010 homelessness program. But it has yet to spend serious political capital extracting the money from Congress. It is should do so this time around, lest this creative idea never come to fruition."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/world/asia/a-fiery-preachers-arrival-shakes-pakistani-politics.html,"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan — Campaign season has begun in Pakistan, with elections widely expected by mid-May that, if they proceed peacefully, would represent a democratic milestone in a country plagued by intermittent military rule.But the starting whistle has been sounded by an unlikely figure: a tough-talking preacher who is calling for a democratic “revolution,” even if he is not eligible for election himself.Little known in Pakistan just one month ago, the preacher, Muhammad Tahir-ul Qadri, a white-bearded Sufi scholar with a taste for hard politics, has taken the country by storm in recent weeks in a campaign that has gripped the news media and jolted the traditional political mainstream.After returning from Canada, where he has lived for seven years, Mr. Qadri made his first mark with a large rally in Lahore on Dec. 23 in which he demanded that President Asif Ali Zardari’s government resign to make way for a caretaker administration led by technocrats.Now he is mobilizing a “million man” march that he says will reach the capital, Islamabad, on Monday, where he promises to lead a lengthy sit-in that will kick off a “moral revolution” similar to the one in Tahrir Square in Cairo that overthrew the Egyptian ruling order. “There will be no defeat,” Mr. Qadri, 61, said in a phone interview on Saturday. “This is for a spiritual and moral revolution. We will not surrender before corruption.”That message resonates with ordinary Pakistanis weary of poor governance, dire energy shortages and sickening violence. On Saturday, ethnic Hazara Shiites in the city of Quetta blocked a road with the coffins of victims of a sectarian attack in the city on Thursday night. The death toll from the attack — the worst ever against the Hazara — has since risen to 96, according to Reuters, and the protesters said they would remove the coffins only when the army took over security in Quetta.But Mr. Qadri’s sudden arrival on the political scene has also brought worries that he represents the interests of forces bent on derailing Pakistan’s fragile democratic order.Questions have been raised about Mr. Qadri’s source of money — one opposition senator estimates that he has already spent $4 million on relentless television advertising — and, inevitably in a country where conspiracy theories run rife, media reports have buzzed with allegations of outside support.Some theories focus on Western governments, particularly the United States, but most analysts point to the convergence between Mr. Qadri’s agenda and that of the powerful military, which has done little to disguise its disdain for Mr. Zardari — and even the opposition leaders who threaten to replace him.Richard E. Hoagland, the American deputy ambassador, told reporters in Islamabad on Jan. 5 that the United States did not support any Pakistani party and denied any link to Mr. Qadri.The planned march on Islamabad “reflects the military’s desire for regime change” and “signals that military interest in political engineering is alive and well,” said Shamila N. Chaudhary, an analyst at the Eurasia Group who formerly served as the director for Afghanistan and Pakistan on President Obama’s National Security Council.But, Ms. Chaudhary added, the days when Pakistan’s military could seize power on a whim have passed, thanks to an aggressive news media and fiercely independent courts. “Real regime change led by Qadri is most unlikely,” she said.Nonetheless, the government is taking him seriously. The interior minister, Rehman Malik, citing security concerns, has vowed to prevent the march from reaching the gates of Parliament in Islamabad. Security officials say a large crowd in Islamabad would provide an easy target for a suicide bombing by Islamist extremists that, in turn, could set off widespread unrest and open the door to a military intervention.Both the military and Mr. Qadri have publicly denied working together. Others say such comments are scaremongering meant to quell a movement that taps into popular discontent.At the very least, the situation betrays government jitters about whether it can survive until its term ends on March 17. It is expected to set elections for some time in April or May and appoint a government to take over until the vote. If a peaceful election follows, the transfer of power would represent a first in a country that has suffered three military coups over nearly six decades.But Mr. Qadri will not be running for office — as a dual citizen of Pakistan and Canada, he is ineligible under Pakistani law.He has been in office before, however. Before he became a citizen of Canada, he was elected to Parliament under the military leader Gen. Pervez Musharraf in 2002, only to resign two years later, disillusioned. Mr. Qadri, a lawyer and scholar, moved to the Toronto area, where he concentrated on his religious work, promoting interfaith harmony and hosting deradicalization seminars for young Muslims in the United States, Canada and Denmark, he said. According to his Web site, his organization, Minhaj ul-Quran, is active in 90 countries. Inside Pakistan, the group runs a university in Lahore and over 600 schools and colleges, he said.Supporters are drawn by his mix of modernism and religious conservatism. Corruption is a focus of his politics, and he insists that all election candidates should be vetted by the country’s tax authorities. He is less clear, though, about his own finances. Street traders, small businesses and ordinary Pakistanis are financing his impressive drive, Mr. Qadri said. So has his family: his wife and daughters pawned their jewelry to help out, he added.But the preacher could not name one major campaign donor, or say how much his team had spent on television advertisements. “I don’t get involved in these things,” he said.Heated talk of democratic upsets has come and gone before in Pakistan, and the potency of Mr. Qadri’s challenge should become apparent on Monday. Ms. Chaudhary, the analyst, predicted that he was “ultimately unlikely to shape the election results.”For his part, Mr. Qadri has moderated his demands, stressing that his goal is simply to nudge Pakistan toward more open leadership. “I can’t say that Pakistan will become America or Canada in a couple of years,” he said. “But we want a reflection of America, to put the process on track.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/business/how-boehner-could-find-blue-sky-above-the-debt-ceiling.html,"ALTHOUGH he has been re-elected as House speaker, John Boehner is in danger of becoming irrelevant to the crucial economics discussions that must occur over the next few months.A valuable principle of negotiation is to “never bargain with someone who does not have the power to say yes,” and Mr. Boehner has demonstrated that he lacks that power. He couldn’t even persuade his caucus to agree on a Plan B counterproposal and had to let Vice President Joseph Biden and Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, steer the deal that avoided, or at least postponed, the so-called fiscal cliff.I have a suggestion for how Mr. Boehner could have himself invited back to the negotiation party. But first, let’s take stock of where we are.What has been accomplished, for better or worse, is that the Bush-era tax cuts for families earning less than $450,000 a year have been made permanent — or at least as permanent as anything in the tax code can be. Those earning more than $450,000 face a tax increase. There are further complications, of course, but the important thing is that there was no substantive tax reform, and no decisions about spending. The final bill even preserved the tradition of corporate welfare by extending a subsidy to Nascar.Over the next few months, Congress faces a new series of deadlines:The spending cuts mandated by the sequestration will begin on March 1, unless Congress delays them again. Congress needs to pass a “continuing resolution” or government will shut down, as it did in the 1990s during the standoff between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. And, finally, the debt ceiling will need to be raised or the government will no longer be able to pay its bills to Social Security beneficiaries, the military or the owners of government bonds — a group that includes nearly everyone with a retirement account.I have listed these deadlines in increasing order of their hazard to our economic health. The spending cuts would be tough and arbitrary but gradual. Incurring them for a couple of months would be bad, but not horrible. Closing down the government is more serious. And even if you’d like a smaller government, you probably still want essential services to continue.OF the three, the debt ceiling is likely to arrive first and is simultaneously the most serious and the most ridiculous. It’s serious because it’s unthinkable that the government would stop paying its bills, and the ramifications if we defaulted on our debt payments would be catastrophic for the nation and the global economy. We don’t even want to think about going there.But the debt ceiling is also ridiculous, because the law is redundant. It’s a tradition for members of Congress who aren’t in the same political party as the president to make sanctimonious speeches against raising the debt limit, to keep that president from running up big bills. Yet it is Congress, in fact, that determines how much we spend and how much tax revenue we collect. Our representatives and their predecessors passed the bills and authorized the spending that got us to this place. If they want to reduce the deficit, they should cut spending, increase revenue, or both. But what they should not do, under any circumstances, is to look back at the decisions they have already made and conclude that it would be smart to declare the United States bankrupt, thus creating a second global financial crisis.Which leads to my proposal for restoring Mr. Boehner’s relevance: He should propose that the debt ceiling be raised for at least two years or, even better, propose that it be abolished. He wouldn’t need a majority of his own party to vote for such a bill, of course, because it would have wide support among Democrats. He would just have to propose it and persuade some of his colleagues to support it. That would be enough.Here is why I think this is a good idea, for him, the Republican Party and the country:Congress has plenty of incentives to make a deal on spending. Taxes have already been increased and Republicans are eager to even the score. The sequestration-induced spending cuts coming on March 1 should provide more than enough impetus for Congress and the president to agree to something, even if it’s only a plan to undertake serious tax reform and a comprehensive evaluation of all government spending. By removing an option that we should never rationally use, we can immediately accomplish an often-cited Republican goal — reducing global uncertainty — and likely restore our triple-A credit rating. The Bipartisan Policy Center has estimated that the dillydallying about the debt ceiling last time, which ticked up interest rates, will end up costing more than $18.9 billion over 10 years, about the same amount as the recent Medicare “doc fix, ” which blocks cuts to doctor reimbursement rates.Tea Party conservatives would undoubtedly be outraged by this suggestion, arguing that Republicans need to retain the debt ceiling threat if they are to get the best possible deal from the Senate and the president. But taking this crazy threat away from a group that just might use it is precisely the point.By undertaking this act of unilateral disarmament, Mr. Boehner and whichever Republicans had the courage to join him would be signaling that they’re willing to engage in the serious discussions the country needs, and to put pressure on Democrats to do likewise. Anyone who has a large bomb and is threatening to push the button doesn’t deserve to be a party to these discussions."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-is-a-bigger-house-better.html,"Readers debate how to make Congress less dysfunctional.To the Editor:The founding fathers intended that voters should have personal knowledge of the people they sent to govern in Washington. Few of today’s voters really know the candidates; this makes misrepresentation easy and effective, and creates the need for large sums of money for political campaigns, leaving the candidates beholden to those moneyed interests. So, what happened?House districts were supposed to be small. The final act of the Constitutional Convention was to reduce the minimum size of a House district from 40,000 to 30,000. Today the average Congressional district includes 710,000 people, so only a small percentage of the voters have any idea what the candidates are like as people.The founders believed that for a republican form of government to succeed, it should be populated with men of virtue. They also recognized that government quite naturally attracts the power-hungry. So they sought to build safeguards against scoundrels into the system. Over the years we’ve allowed these safety mechanisms to be overridden.The safeguard most easily restored is a return to small House districts. It can be achieved without a constitutional amendment by the simple passage of a bill to reduce the size of Congressional districts to, say, 100,000 people. House membership would increase from 435 — set by a 1911 law — to about 3,100.This move has the added benefit of introducing a flow of new faces into Washington. These men and women would owe their seats more to the reputation they enjoyed within their community and less to the half-truths and misinformation put out by slick mass media campaigns paid for by the big-money interests. Surely among them would be the men and women of virtue so necessary to the proper functioning of our republican form of government. And so lacking today.GAIL L. JOHNSON Ewing, N.J., Jan. 7, 2013The writer is the author of “Two Years to Democracy: The 2Y2D Plan.” Readers ReactWhile Ms. Johnson’s idea of reducing the size of Congressional districts is intriguing, and would allow us to somewhat shed the yoke of gerrymandering, it is also hopelessly undoable. Where would Ms. Johnson have 3,100 representatives convene? The Kennedy Center? Madison Square Garden? Speaker John A. Boehner can’t control his own Republican caucus, much less dealing with an influx of “new faces” in a body some seven times larger than the current 435.I applaud Ms. Johnson for trying to deal with what the House of Representatives has become, but her plan, even if it could be passed, which is highly doubtful, is really unmanageable.What is really needed is for constituents in every district to get involved from Day 1 of the primary process, and to get to know who the candidates are and what they stand for.HENRY A. LOWENSTEIN New York, Jan. 9, 2013 Ms. Johnson’s suggested fix for the House, increasing the number of members from 435 to about 3,100, is perhaps the worst vision of the future I have heard. Better to disband the House than to increase its size.If we have learned anything from the past two years, it is that the House is a senseless waste of taxpayer money. It costs hundreds of millions in its present size and accomplishes almost nothing. Congress reached a new low of a 10 percent favorability rating last year, and Ms. Johnson’s solution is to make the House seven times larger?The dysfunction of the House is based in large measure on the provincial nature of the interests of its members. Increase that number sevenfold and what do you get? I suspect reams of legislation that abandon core issues and are laden with pork.If the government of the United States were run like a successful business, the board of directors would have decided long ago to eliminate the most obvious impediment to progress. That impediment is the House of Representatives.MICHAEL G. THOMAS Sawyer, Mich., Jan. 9, 2013 Like many commentators, Ms. Johnson oversimplifies how the founders of the American republic thought about representation. The anti-Federalist opponents of the Constitution wanted representatives who would show “sympathy” for the interests of their constituents. Increasing the size of the House of Representatives, up to a point, would be compatible with their views.But the Federalist supporters of the Constitution had a different view. Read James Madison’s or Alexander Hamilton’s writings on representation, for example, and you will find that they emphasize knowledge and deliberation. Madison thought that the House could hold a couple of hundred members. Beyond that, he worried that a continuing increase in size would destroy the possibility of deliberation.Granted, Congress no longer operates in the grand debate manner of the late 18th and 19th centuries. But it still does a great deal of deliberation. How would a House composed of 3,100 members deliberate?Ms. Johnson wants to solve a problem that may not really exist. Most members of the House, even from the safest seats, spend large amounts of time soliciting the views of voters in their districts. Nor has anyone faulted Congress for failing to provide constituent services.The real problem, as virtually every observer notes, has been the measurable increase in the polarization of the parties and, arguably, the obstructionist ethos prevailing among Republicans.Increasing the size of the House would only compound this problem. A much better answer would involve using the redistricting process to make Congressional races more competitive.JACK RAKOVE Stanford, Calif., Jan. 9, 2013The writer is a professor of history and political science at Stanford University and the author of “Original Meanings,” which won the 1997 Pulitzer Prize for history. Doing something about the currently dysfunctional House of Representatives is an excellent idea. But 3,100 representatives would make for a terribly unwieldy body. Getting any legislation passed would be an even greater challenge than it is today. Another downside would be that state legislatures would be able to gerrymander districts even more precisely than they do now.Why not go in the opposite direction by doubling the size of districts to an even 1.5 million? It would harder to gerrymander such districts, and it could reverse the trend toward “safe seats” since the enlarged districts would include far more diverse populations. Also, a smaller house would probably function more efficiently.EDWIN SAFFORD Wading River, N.Y., Jan. 9, 2013The writer is a former Congressional correspondent for the Newhouse News Service. Vastly increasing the number of House seats as suggested would shift power and political influence to the more densely populated areas.The answer to populating the House with people of virtue and eliminating the power-hungry — and their waste, corruption and self-interest — is term limits, so that re-election and maintaining power aren’t our representatives’ main concerns.ERIC WILSON Naples, Fla., Jan. 9, 2013 Ms. Johnson’s idea for reforming the House is grounded in at least two dubious assumptions. First, that gridlock in Washington is rooted in a lack of familiarity between citizens and their representatives. Second, that the United States was better governed earlier in our history when House districts were smaller.The first assumption is questionable because of recent gerrymandering, which has made many districts more homogeneous. Indeed, many representatives, particularly Republicans, are so afraid of primary challenges that they dare not go against the orthodoxy their districts demand. If anything there is often too much affinity between constituents and the actions of representatives, restraining members of Congress from taking the risks that legislative leadership demands.The second assumption is faulty because it enshrines the early Republic as the ideal that we should be striving to achieve in the present. Certainly early American leaders talked a great deal about virtue, but in terms of governing they had far less on their plate. The federal government was not nearly as large, legislative sessions were shorter and, most important, most legislators had to concern themselves only with the opinions of white male property owners, instead of balancing the demands of numerous groups.In conclusion, a larger House may help solve Washington’s problems, but more cooks in the kitchen alone will not do.JAMES THAJUDEEN Brooklyn, Jan. 9, 2013 Let’s require our elected officials to be in the district or state they represent and reasonably available to their voters at least 10 consecutive working days a month. Technology has made communication so easy that most of what they need to do in Washington can be done from Des Moines.This change will make it possible for more people — and more different kinds of people — to serve, since they can maintain a normal family life where they live. It will mean that they use the same hospitals, roads and schools as their constituents. It will make it easier for voters, not lobbyists, to know and to communicate with their representatives.JOEL BLACKWELL Corte Madera, Calif., Jan. 9, 2013The writer is an author and consultant on exercising political power.The Writer RespondsAll the letter writers agree that the House has become dysfunctional.Reducing the size of Congressional districts to 100,000 is not a prescription for an ideal government; it is a specific plan to make the House more viable within our existing Constitution. Congress and the president can make it happen. The states already have mechanisms to deal with the resulting reapportionment.The alternatives offered by Mr. Thomas and Mr. Wilson — disbanding the House and term limits — require a constitutional amendment. Mr. Thomas’s plan would return us to a confederation of states. If Congressional districts were set to 1.5 million people as Mr. Safford suggests, the 11 states with fewer than 1.5 million would be overrepresented in the House, just as they already are in the Senate.The idea of 3,100 representatives becomes less outrageous when one considers that the House already employs 10,000 staff members.With regard to Professor Rakove’s comments, in the Federalist James Madison wrote, “At the expiration of twenty-five years, according to the computed rate of increase, the number of representatives will amount to two hundred; and of fifty years, to four hundred.” And, “The remaining charge against the House of Representatives, which I am to examine, is grounded on a supposition that the number of members will not be augmented from time to time, as the progress of population may demand. It has been admitted that this objection, if well supported, would have great weight.” It is not too great a stretch to believe that Madison would be disturbed that after 225 years the House has only 435 members to speak for 310 million people.Professor Rakove identifies the need for more competitive elections, as do Mr. Lowenstein, Mr. Safford and Mr. Thajudeen with their gerrymandering comments. By reducing the cost of campaigns, small districts will enable more healthy competition for House seats.A marketing campaign targeting 100,000 people quickly hits diminishing returns. A higher percentage of voters will know the candidates and be less likely to be swayed by advertising. Face time with constituents becomes more productive than hours of fund-raising. The voters can make a more informed choice about the person they send to Congress. And representatives will be less beholden to special interests.GAIL L. JOHNSON Ewing, N.J., Jan. 10, 2013"

Born three blocks from Ebbets Field and becalmed in the borough ever since, he spends every day — Sundays included — at ribbon cuttings, street renamings and political dinners, learning his constituents’ problems, doing whatever his City Charter-limited powers allow, and, always, cheering the borough. After 23 years as a state senator, he was elected to “the job I always wanted” in 2001. Now 67, he lives in a brick house in Windsor Terrace with his wife, Jamie, 54, a graphic artist; they have an African gray parrot named Beep (as in B.P.) that he calls his son.AS IF IT WERE WEDNESDAY It’s a rare morning I’m not up at 5 o’clock. You’d think your body was saying “It’s Wednesday.” The first thing I do after checking e-mail is wake my son. I open the shade and take off his cage cover. I stick my finger in the cage and he bites it two or three times. Then he’s ready for me to open the cage door. Then I go to my door and take the papers — The Times, The Post and The Daily News.A WALK AND SHOPPING My wife and I change into sweat pants and we do a brisk walk around half of Prospect Park. I have a treadmill — it’s a place I hang my stuff. It feels like an orphan. Then we go to the farmers’ market at P.S. 154. She gets fresh vegetables, fresh fish. One vendor has breads, homemade butter cakes and all sorts of things I don’t need. They have very good onion rolls. Sometimes my wife sees me with the roll. Sometimes she doesn’t.BREAKFAST AND BEYOND What does every Jew eat on Sunday morning — bagels, lox and cream cheese. The lox is usually from Fairway or Shelsky’s on Smith Street. If I have an event at a Manhattan hotel I’ll buy it at Barney Greengrass or Russ & Daughters. With Russ & Daughters I love their potato latkes; with Barney Greengrass, their chopped whitefish salad. I usually have a piece of cheesecake from Junior’s. It’s sort of a Sunday pick-me-up. The question is: Should I have it after breakfast or wait?BOROUGH OF CHURCHES I check the wedding announcements and send a letter of congratulations if the couple lives in Brooklyn. Lots of Sundays I go to church — in suit and tie. I’m there to share a few words with my constituents. Catholics and Jews don’t permit public officials to speak, but the Baptists, Episcopalians and Methodists do.OUT AND ABOUT  Almost every Sunday is a busy day for any working politician. Boy Scouts, half-marathon race, T.E.A.L. [Tell Every Amazing Lady, the ovarian cancer group]. FIDO [Fellowship for the Interests of Dogs and Their Owners] in Prospect Park has a Christmas party for dogs. Whatever anyone’s interested in, there’s an organization to meet their interests. If it’s a catered event, it would be disrespectful if I didn’t try something. What would they think if I turned something down?EVENING AT HOME When I married, I promised my wife I would keep Sunday evenings free of events. I basically kept my promise. However, it would be totally disrespectful if I didn’t attend the annual dinner of Frank Seddio [the Brooklyn Democratic leader]. That’s the one exception. At home, dinner is takeout or reheat. During the summer my wife enjoys barbecuing — a piece of fish or hamburger. Then 8 p.m. we have to see “Boardwalk Empire.” Steve Buscemi is Brooklyn, and the originator, Terence Winter, is also Brooklyn. I do watch “Real Housewives.” My wife falls asleep first, and then I mosey very quietly and take care of business — the devil’s food cheesecake — and fall asleep with a big smile."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/world/europe/protesters-in-paris-march-against-gay-marriage.html,"PARIS — Several hundred thousand people massed at the Eiffel Tower in Paris on Sunday to protest a plan by President François Hollande to legalize gay marriage and adoption.Three columns of protesters, waving pink and blue flags showing a father, mother and two children, converged from different meeting points in Paris. Many came after long train and bus rides from the provinces.Mr. Hollande has pledged to push through the law with his Socialists’ parliamentary majority but a campaign by opponents has dented public support and forced deputies to put off a plan to allow lesbian couples access to artificial insemination.The park at the Eiffel Tower was packed, but turnout estimates varied widely. Organizers claimed 800,000 had protested, while police put the number at 340,000, high even in protest-prone France.“Nobody expected this two or three months ago,” said Frigide Barjot, a flamboyant comedian leading the protest. At the rally, she read out a letter to Mr. Hollande asking him to withdraw the draft bill and hold an extended public debate.Strongly backed by the Catholic Church hierarchy, Ms. Barjot and groups working with her mobilized churchgoing families and political conservatives as well as some Muslims, evangelicals and even homosexuals opposed to gay marriage to protest.Mr. Hollande’s office said the turnout was “substantial” but would not change his determination to pass the reform.“The French are tolerant, but they are deeply attached to the family and the defense of children,” said Daniel Liechti, vice president of the National Council of French Evangelicals, which urged its members to join the march.Opponents of gay marriage and adoption, including most faith leaders in France, have argued that the reform would create psychological and social problems for children, which they believe should trump the desire for equal rights for gay adults.Mr. Hollande has angered those opposed to same-sex marriage by trying to avoid public debate on the reform, which the justice minister, Christiane Taubira, described as “a change of civilization”, and then wavering about some of its details.Same-sex weddings are legal in 11 countries including Belgium, Portugal, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Norway and South Africa, as well as nine American states and the District of Columbia."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/world/asia/president-of-sri-lanka-dismisses-chief-justice.html,"NEW DELHI — President Mahinda Rajapaksa of Sri Lanka removed the nation’s chief justice from office on Sunday in the culmination of a widely criticized impeachment process that has crippled the nation’s courts and may precipitate a constitutional crisis.Mr. Rajapaksa’s decision to sign a decree dismissing Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake came two days after Parliament, packed with Rajapaksa loyalists, voted to impeach her in defiance of a Court of Appeals ruling. The court had nullified the verdict of a parliamentary panel that had found the chief justice guilty of financial irregularities. Separately, the Supreme Court had ruled that the impeachment process was illegal.Religious leaders, pro-democracy activists and lawyers groups have denounced the impeachment process as a naked power grab by Mr. Rajapaksa and members of his family who serve in his government. Lawyers across Sri Lanka boycotted courts on Thursday and Friday in protest.Many lawyers have vowed to oppose anyone appointed to fill the chief justice’s post. Ms. Bandaranayake was seen as a Rajapaksa loyalist until she ruled in September that Mr. Rajapaksa’s younger brother, Basil Rajapaksa, needed to submit a $600 million development bill to the nation’s nine provincial councils before it could be approved.In November, the governing party filed impeachment motions against her, and in December a parliamentary panel appointed by another of the president’s brothers found her guilty.The United States government has repeatedly expressed concern about the impeachment process. Ms. Bandaranayake has yet to announce whether she will accept the president’s decision to remove her from office. She had earlier protested the rapidity of the parliamentary proceedings and her inability to confront or cross-examine her accusers.President Rajapaksa and his government ended one of the world’s longest and bloodiest civil wars in 2009 by defeating the separatist Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, bringing stability to much of the country and increasing opportunities for tourism. But he and his brothers have been accused of being involved in unlawful killings of civilians, and a United Nations panel ruled that accusations of war crimes against the Sri Lankan government were credible and should be investigated."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/nyregion/miss-america-mallory-hagan-embraces-brooklyn.html,"When the news rippled through the bars, cafes and organic markets, some people just raised their eyebrows. Others laughed.The newest Miss America, here, living in Windsor Terrace, Brooklyn? Here, stopping in for a chat with the waiter and a vegetarian egg-white omelet at South Slope’s Windsor Cafe?Here, going for runs in Prospect Park, among some of the Americans least likely to watch the pageant at which she was crowned winner on Saturday night?“It’s bizarre, right?” said Jane Hoppen, a writer, sitting at the bar at the Double Windsor in southern Park Slope on Sunday afternoon. Nothing against Miss America herself, whom she called a “damned good tap dancer,” but, well, to be honest: “We don’t believe in beauty pageants.”Though Ms. Hoppen did not specify who “we” might be, she could have been speaking for any number of local residents who would rather their daughters identify as Ms., not Miss.The Miss in question, Mallory Hagan, is a student at the Fashion Institute of Technology whose victory was credited to her tap dancing (to James Brown’s “Get Up Offa That Thing”), her campaign against child sexual abuse, and her adroit response when asked whether schools should hire armed guards (“I don’t think the proper way to fight violence is with violence”).An Alabama native who moved to New York several years ago and became Miss Brooklyn in 2010, Ms. Hagan, 23, is not exactly a Brooklyn product. But she appears to have embraced the borough, even if it is not yet quite so ready to reciprocate. “In the time I’ve spent in New York, Brooklyn has grown very close to my heart. I love New York (and not in a tourist T-shirt kind of way) dearly and I truly believe this is the city where dreams come true,” she wrote on her blog. “Thank you, Brooklyn, for helping me get one step closer to mine.”Southern transplant though she is, Senator Charles E. Schumer was quick to hail her victory for New York. (The last Miss New York to win the Miss America title was Vanessa Williams, the actress and singer, nearly 30 years ago; she relinquished her title after a magazine published nude photos of her less than a year later.)“Just goes to show that people from Brooklyn can do everything and anything,” the senator said. “Pizza, bagels, beauty and talent — there’s nothing we don’t have in the borough of Kings.”Amy Brill, 42, a writer who lives just south of Prospect Park, simply laughed when she heard the news.“That’s hilarious!” She turned to her 4-year-old daughter, Isa, and asked, “Do you know who Miss America is?”Isa shook her head.“Miss America is a girl who represents our country,” Ms. Brill said, offering what some might consider a wishful description. “What do you think she should be like?”“Like she’s a real person,” Isa replied, adding thoughtfully: “Like she’s not a baby.”Much as Ms. Brill might hope her young daughters grow up to possess those same qualities, she said she would “never in a million years” encourage them to enter a pageant.“I want them to feel beautiful every minute of their lives, and I want them to judge whether they’re beautiful,” she said, “and not anybody else.”Even if her particular ambition did not find favor, some saw Ms. Hagan’s story as a classic tale of making it in the big city, albeit with an unorthodox twist.Ms. Hagan has said she came to New York in 2008 with a large suitcase and less than $1,000, dreaming of becoming Miss America and then, someday, a big-time cosmetics executive. She competed for the Miss New York title twice before winning it last year, and wrote that she juggled full-time employment and school in addition to her pageant duties.At least one Windsor Terrace resident needs no convincing.“That’s Brooklyn chutzpah,” said Marty Markowitz, the Brooklyn borough president, who has met Ms. Hagan a few times. “Who’s more Brooklyn — somebody that voluntarily decided to leave wherever they lived and chose Brooklyn to live and reside and whatever? Or someone who was born and raised here and decided to leave us?“She is Brooklyn,” Mr. Markowitz proclaimed, praising Ms. Hagan’s grit and down-to-earth quality. “She may have a little Southern twang, but we have a Brooklyn twang, too.”But was Miss America, the pageant, equally “Brooklyn”? That, Mr. Markowitz acknowledged, was a somewhat more difficult proposition.“There’s a lot of things Brooklyn, but if you would have said to me Miss America, it was out of my — ” he said, sounding at a loss for words. “It’s just not the kind of thing the — you know?”Yes, his constituents know. But a few were following Mr. Markowitz’s lead and making overtures toward the new hometown queen, even if partly in jest.The staff at the Double Windsor put out a sign advertising the “Mallory Hagan” special: a pint of a local beer and an Alabama slammer — a shot of Southern Comfort, amaretto, grenadine and lime juice — for $7.“Congrats Mallory our neighborhood Miss America!” it read. “If you are Miss America, come in for your free bacon cheeseburger and unlimited fries.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/nyregion/house-to-take-up-sandy-relief-bill-amid-battle-over-spending.html,"WASHINGTON — The House will move ahead this week with a multibillion-dollar package to provide aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy, but the legislation is already caught in an escalating debate over spending and deficits that foreshadows another ugly fight among Republicans.Squeezed between the demands of Northeastern Republicans and conservatives, House Republican leaders have orchestrated a legislative approach that they say will allow $50 billion in aid to be approved on Tuesday.A bare-bones package totaling $17 billion would come to a vote first, followed by a $33.7 billion amendment written by New Jersey and New York Republicans. That way House conservatives can vote for some, but not all, of the assistance, which ultimately would rely on Democratic votes to push it to the finish.The $33.7 billion installment is facing severe resistance because some of it would go to projects and programs far from the hurricane disaster zone, and much of it, although related to Hurricane Sandy, can barely be considered emergency aid.The list of nonemergency items is considerable: $25 million to improve weather forecasting and hurricane intensity predictions; $118 million for Amtrak’s Northeast corridor, with only $32 million for storm-related repairs; $16 billion in development funds for any community declared a disaster zone from 2011 to 2013; and $2 billion for highway spending nationwide.“There are a core of items that truly meet vital needs,” said Steve Ellis, the vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. “But that is overshadowed by the fact that billions of dollars have been added to things that should be paid for through the normal budget process.”Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, scheduled the vote in the House over a week ago after drawing sharp rebukes for adjourning the previous Congress last year without taking up a $60.4 billion aid bill that the Senate had passed to finance recovery efforts in the hurricane-battered states.Several prominent Northeastern Republicans were among the loudest critics, including Representative Peter T. King of Long Island, N.Y., and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is a possible presidential contender in 2016.To be sure, House Republicans have removed a number of items included in the Senate bill that vaguely resembled pork-barrel spending and were included to win enough votes in that chamber to ensure the bill’s passage late last year.Among the items removed were $150 million for fisheries in Alaska and Mississippi and $56 million for the West Coast to clean up debris from the 2011 tsunami in Japan. But while their removal was intended to mollify fiscal conservatives in the House, it might undermine support for the package in the Senate.Even so, the House debate will most likely become messy — and passage may still be threatened by the minefield of amendments the bill will probably face on Tuesday. Passage of any of those amendments could imperil the package’s prospects for quick approval in the Senate.By the House Rules Committee’s deadline for amendments at 4 p.m. Friday, some 92 had been submitted, most to either cut spending in the package or demand cuts elsewhere in the budget. Some amendments are quick strikes, like eliminating $111 million for improving weather satellite technology. Other amendments are more ambitious, like one proposed by a group of conservatives calling for cuts in other popular programs to pay for the relief package. (A senior Democratic Senate aide said such a move would imperil the overall package in that chamber.)“We’d rather not have to deal with any of these amendments,” Mr. King said. “But I am confident that we will be able to defeat any amendments that come up for a vote.”Supporters of the larger aid package say that many of the items are legitimate and that critics are misconstruing them. For instance, under the larger bill, drafted by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey, $16 billion in development funds would be designated for any community declared a disaster zone between 2011 and 2013; that includes 47 states and Puerto Rico. And $2 billion is set aside for highway spending nationwide.In both those cases, an aide explained, federal rules make those huge infusions necessary if money is to get to New York and New Jersey. Highways needing repair after the storm, for instance, fall to the back of the line of projects still awaiting assistance after earlier disasters. Only by financing those previous projects can lawmakers rush aid to the Northeast storm zone.Supporters also point to the $118 million for Amtrak’s Northeast corridor. While acknowledging that only $32 million would go to hurricane-related repairs, they note that the rest would go to bolstering the system’s ability to withstand future storms, as well as to long-planned improvements.Mr. Ellis, of the taxpayers’ group, said that previous disaster bills taken up by Congress had been stuffed with more flagrant examples of pork-barrel spending. But, he said, the Hurricane Sandy bill followed a pattern established in the era of Tom DeLay, the House Republican leader from 2003 to 2005: Congress adopts hard caps on spending to prove its fiscal discipline, then uses emergency spending bills to get around those caps.“Don’t get me wrong,” Mr. Ellis said, “this is better than business as usual because these things are normally bigger Christmas trees.”“But,” he added, “because of our nation’s dire fiscal situation, we cannot afford anything remotely resembling business as usual anymore.”"

Mr. Schumer has told aides and other senators that he could be persuaded to support Mr. Hagel depending on the meeting’s outcome. Mr. Hagel’s nomination has been met with suspicion, and even outright hostility, among Republicans and Democrats who are strongly aligned with Jewish groups.Mr. Schumer plans to ask Mr. Hagel to clarify and in some ways recant statements about Iran and Israel, according to a person with knowledge of the senator’s plans for the meeting. Mr. Schumer also intends to press Mr. Hagel about conservative views he has expressed on gay rights and abortion. Other Democrats are likely to take their cues about the nomination from Mr. Schumer, who is the No. 3 Democrat in the Senate and has strong ties to pro-Israel groups.Of deepest concern to Mr. Schumer, reflecting the anxiety of many Israel advocacy groups, are Mr. Hagel’s positions on the nuclear threat posed by Iran, according to the person with knowledge of the senator’s plans. Mr. Hagel has said a military strike against Iran would be counterproductive.But Mr. Hagel got a resounding vote of support on Sunday from a fellow Republican moderate, Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, who said on the NBC News program “Meet the Press” that Mr. Hagel was “superbly qualified.”“First, I think he’s had a very, very distinguished public service record that he can stand on,” Mr. Powell said. “There are a lot of comments about different things he said over the years, and I think he’ll have a chance to respond to all those comments at the confirmation hearings.”Another Republican, Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee, said on the ABC News program “This Week” that he had questions about Mr. Hagel’s “overall temperament.”Mr. Schumer is also suspicious of comments by Mr. Hagel that seem to support a strategy of containment, in which the United States would accept Iran’s development of a nuclear weapon while seeking to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.Mr. Hagel might need to fully reject that strategy in order to bring his position in line with President Obama’s and Mr. Schumer’s. During his race against Mitt Romney last year, Mr. Obama took a more forceful position against Iran.As a senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel voted against several rounds of sanctions against Iran that ultimately passed the Senate. Mr. Hagel has said unilateral sanctions are ineffective, a position that is out of step with the Obama administration’s thinking. But in recent weeks, Mr. Hagel has sounded more hawkish about Iran in meetings with administration officials.Mr. Hagel’s views on the militant Islamist groups Hezbollah and Hamas have also become issues. He was among only a handful of senators who declined to sign a letter to the European Union calling for the designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization.Mr. Hagel has since said he does not believe in sending letters to foreign governments. He has also supported direct negotiations between the United States and Hamas, which governs Gaza.Mr. Schumer will seek reassurances that Mr. Hagel now considers Hezbollah and Hamas to be terrorist groups, the person familiar with his plans said.Mr. Schumer is also expected to ask Mr. Hagel about his disparaging statements about gay people — remarks he has since apologized for — and his views on abortion, particularly his opposition to allowing abortions for women in the military who have been raped, a position that has upset some Democratic women in the Senate.Although Mr. Schumer said Mr. Obama should have discretion over appointments to his cabinet, people close to the senator said his concerns would need to be put to rest before he would support Mr. Hagel’s nomination.Jewish groups that have met with Mr. Schumer have expressed reservations about openly opposing Mr. Hagel’s nomination for fear of inflaming their tensions with the Obama administration and deepening difficulties between the United States and Israel. Further, it would be a major break with the Obama administration for Mr. Schumer to oppose him.On Sunday, Mr. Hagel continued to draw criticism from conservatives who share Mr. Schumer’s worries about Israel and Iran and have lingering concerns about Mr. Hagel’s criticisms of the Bush administration’s execution of the Iraq war.Senator John McCain of Arizona said on “Face the Nation” that Mr. Hagel’s early opposition to the troop surge in Iraq was “bizarre.” Mr. McCain is the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee, which will conduct Mr. Hagel’s confirmation hearing."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/us/politics/full-transcript-of-president-obamas-press-conference.html,"The following is the complete transcript of President Obama’s press conference on Monday in Washington. (Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service.)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Please, have a seat, everybody. Good morning. I thought it might make sense to take some questions this week, as my first term comes to an end.It’s been a busy and productive four years, and I expect the same from the next four years. I intend to carry out the agenda that I campaigned on, an agenda for new jobs, new opportunity and new security for the middle class.Now right now our economy is growing, and our businesses are creating new jobs. So we are poised for a good year -- if we make smart decisions, sound investments, and as long as Washington politics don’t get in the way of America’s progress.As I said on the campaign, one component to growing our economy and broadening opportunity for the middle class is shrinking our deficits in a balanced and responsible way. And for nearly two years now I’ve been fighting for such a plan, one that would reduce our deficits by $4 trillion over the next decade, which would stabilize our debt and our deficit in a sustainable way for the next decade.That would be enough not only to stop the growth of our debt relative to the size of our economy, but it would make it manageable so it doesn’t crowd out the investments we need to make in people and education and job training and science and medical research -- all the things that help us grow.Now, step by step, we’ve made progress towards that goal. Over the past two years, I’ve signed into law about $1.4 trillion in spending cuts. Two weeks ago, I signed into law more than $600 billion in new revenue by making sure the wealthiest Americans begin to pay their fair share.When you add the money it will save in interest payments on the debt, all together that adds up to a total of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the past two years -- not counting the $400 billion already saved from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we’ve made progress. We are moving towards our ultimate goal of getting to a $4 trillion reduction. And there will be more deficit reduction when Congress decides what to do about the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that have been pushed off until next month.The fact is, though, we can’t finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone. The cuts we’ve already made to priorities other than Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Defense mean that we spend, on everything from education to public safety, less, as a share of our economy, than it has -- than has been true for a generation, and that’s not a recipe for growth. So we’ve got to do more both to stabilize our finances over the medium and long term, but also spur more growth in the short term.Now, I’ve said I’ve -- I’m open to making modest adjustments to programs like Medicare to protect them for future generations.I’ve also said that we need more revenue, through tax reform, by closing loopholes in our tax code for the wealthiest Americans. If we combine a balanced package of savings from spending on health care and revenues from closing loopholes, we can solve the deficit issue without sacrificing our investments in things like education that are going to help us grow.Turns out the American people agree with me. They listened to an entire year’s debate over this issue, and they made a clear decision about the approach they prefer. They don’t think it’s fair, for example, to ask a senior to pay more for his or her health care or a scientist to shut down lifesaving research so that a multimillionaire investor can pay less in tax rates than a secretary. They don’t think it’s smart to protect endless corporate loopholes and tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans rather than rebuild our roads and our schools, invest in our workers’ skills or help manufacturers bring jobs back to America.So they want us to get our books in order in a balanced way, where everybody pulls their weight, everyone does their part. That’s what I want as well. That’s what I’ve proposed. And we can get it done, but we’re going to have to make sure that people are looking at this in a responsible way rather than just through the lens of politics.Now, the other congressionally imposed deadline coming up is the so-called debt ceiling, something most Americans hadn’t even heard of before two years ago. So I want to be clear about this: The debt ceiling is not a question of authorizing more spending. Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending. It simply allows the country to pay for spending that Congress has already committed to.These are bills that have already been racked up, and we need to pay them. So while I’m willing to compromise and find common ground over how to reduce our deficits, America cannot afford another debate with this Congress about whether or not they should pay the bills they’ve already racked up.If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America’s bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans’ benefits will be delayed. We might not be able to pay our troops or honor our contracts with small business owners. Food inspectors, air traffic controllers, specialists who track down loose nuclear materials wouldn’t get their paychecks. Investors around the world will ask if the United States of America is in fact a safe bet. Markets could go haywire. Interest rates would spike for anybody who borrows money, every homeowner with a mortgage, every student with a college loan, every small business owner who wants to grow and hire. It would be a self-inflicted wound on the economy. It would slow down our growth, might tip us into recession, and ironically, would probably increase our deficit.So to even entertain the idea of this happening, of the United States of America not paying its bills, is irresponsible. It’s absurd. As the speaker said two years ago, it would be -- and I’m quoting Speaker Boehner now -- “a financial disaster not only for us but for the worldwide economy.” So we got to pay our bills. And Republicans in Congress have two choices here: They can act responsibly and pay America’s bills or they can act irresponsibly and put America through another economic crisis.But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy. The financial well-being of the American people is not leverage to be used. The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not a bargaining chip.And they’d better choose quickly because time is running short. The last time Republicans in Congress even flirted with this idea, our triple-A credit rating was downgraded for the first time in our history, our businesses created the fewest jobs of any month in nearly the past three years, and ironically, the whole fiasco actually added to the deficit.So it shouldn’t be surprising, given all this talk, that the American people think Washington is hurting rather than helping the country at the moment. They see their representatives consumed with partisan brinksmanship over paying our bills while they overwhelmingly want us to focus on growing the economy and creating more jobs.So let’s finish this debate. Let’s give our businesses and the world the certainty that our economy and our reputation are still second to none. We pay our bills, we handle our business, and then we can move on because America has a lot to do. We’ve got to create more jobs. We’ve got to boost the wages of those who have work. And we’ve got to reach for energy independence. We’ve got to reform our immigration system. We’ve got to give our children the best education possible, and we’ve got to do everything we can to protect them from the horrors of gun violence. And let me say I’m grateful to Vice -- Vice President Biden for his work on this issue of gun violence and for his proposals, which I’m going to be reviewing today and I will address in the next few days, and I intend to vigorously pursue.So with that, I’m going to take some questions, and I’m going to start with Julie Pace of AP, and I want to congratulate Julie for this new important job.Q: Thank you very much.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: I wanted to ask about gun violence. Today marks the one-year -- or one-month anniversary of the shooting in Newtown, which seemed to generate some momentum for reinstating the assault weapons ban. But there’s been fresh opposition to that ban from the NRA, and even Harry Reid has said that he questions whether it could pass Congress. Given that, how hard will you push for an assault weapons ban? And if one cannot pass Congress, what other measures would need to be included in a broad package in order to curb gun violence successfully?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I said, the vice president and a number of members of my Cabinet went through a very thorough process over the last month, meeting with a lot of stakeholders in this, including the NRA, listened to proposals from all quarters. And they’ve presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn’t happen again.I’m going to be meeting with the vice president today. I expect to have a fuller presentation later in the week to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do. My starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works. What should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we’re reducing the incidence of gun violence? And I think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the Second Amendment.And then members of Congress, I think, are going to have to have a debate and examine their own conscience because, you know, if, in fact -- and I believe this is true -- everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and -- and -- and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then we’re going to have to vote based on what we think is best.We’re going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside, and that’s what I expect Congress to do.But I -- but I -- what you can count on is, is that the things that I’ve said in the past -- the belief that we have to have stronger background checks, that we can do a much better job in terms of keeping these magazine clips with high capacity out of the hands of folks who shouldn’t have them, an assault weapons ban that is meaningful -- that those are things I continue to believe make sense.(Inaudible) -- will all of them get through this Congress? I don’t know. But what’s uppermost in my mind is making sure that I’m honest with the American people and with members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is -- is something that will make a difference. And to repeat what I’ve said earlier, if there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: I’ll -- I’ll present the details later in the week.Chuck Todd, NBC.Q: As you know, the Senate Democrats, Harry Reid sent you a letter begging you, essentially, to take -- consider some sort of executive action on this debt ceiling issue. I know you’ve said you’re not negotiating on it. Your administration has ruled out the various ideas that have been out there, the 14th Amendment, but just this morning House -- one of the House Democratic leaders, Jim Clyburn, asked you to use the 14th Amendment, and even said sometimes that’s what it takes. He brought up the Emancipation Proclamation, saying it took executive action when Congress wouldn’t act, and he compared the debt ceiling to that.So are you considering a Plan B? And if not, why not?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Chuck, the issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation. And so there’s a very simple solution to this. Congress authorizes us to pay our bills.Now if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happily (sic) to take it. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, had a proposal like that last year, and I’m happy to accept it.But if they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done. And you know, there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no, you know, easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me: You need to fund our Defense Department at such-and-such a level. You need to send Social Security checks. You need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.They lay all this out for me, and -- because they have the spending power. And so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills.Separately, they also have to authorize a raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can’t do is tell me to spend X and then say, but we’re not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.And -- and I just want to repeat, because I think sometimes the American people understandably aren’t following all -- all the debates here in Washington, raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more. All it does is say that America will pay its bills. And we are not a deadbeat nation. And the consequences of us not paying our bills, as I outlined in my opening statement, would be disastrous.So I understand the impulse to try to get around this in a simple way. But there’s one way to get around this. There’s one way to deal with it, and that is for Congress to authorize me to pay for those items of spending that they have already authorized.And you know, the notion that Republicans in the House or maybe some Republicans in the Senate would suggest that in order for us to get our way on our spending priorities that we would risk the full faith and credit of the United States -- that, I think, is not what the founders intended. That’s not how I think most Americans think our democracy should work. You know, they’ve got a point of view. Democrats in Congress have a point of view. They need to sit down and -- and work out a compromise.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: So if you’re not negotiating and they say you have to negotiate and you’re not considering another plan B, do you think we should wait it out and -- (off mic)?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, look, Chuck, there -- there are -- there’s a pretty straightforward way of doing this, and that is to set the debt ceiling aside, we pay our bills and then we have a vigorous debate about how we’re going to do further deficit reduction in a balanced way.I keep in mind that, you know, what we’ve heard from some Republicans in both the House and the Senate is that they will only increase the debt ceiling by the amount of spending cuts that they’re able to push through. And in order to replace the automatic spending cut, the sequester, that’s $1.2 trillion. Say it takes another trillion (dollars) or trillion two to get us through one more year. They’d have to identify $2.5 trillion in cuts just to get the debt ceiling extended to next year -- 2.5 trillion (dollars).They can’t even -- Congress has not been able to identify $1.2 trillion in cuts that they’re happy with, because these same Republicans say they don’t want to cut defense. They claim that they don’t want to gut Medicare or harm the vulnerable, but the truth of the matter is, is that you can’t meet their own criteria without drastically cutting Medicare or having an impact on Medicaid or affecting our defense spending. So the math just doesn’t add up.Now, what -- here’s what would work. What would work would be for us to say, we’ve already done close to $2 trillion in deficit reduction, and if you add the interest that we won’t be paying because of less spending and increased revenue, it adds up to about $2.5 trillion.The consensus is we need about $4 trillion to stabilize our debt and our deficit, which means we need about $1.5 trillion more. The package that I offered to Speaker Boehner before we -- before the new year would achieve that. We were actually fairly close in terms of arriving at that number.So -- so if the goal is to make sure that we are being responsible about our debt and our deficit, if that’s the conversation we’re having, I’m happy to have that conversation. And by closing some additional loopholes through tax reform -- which Speaker Boehner has acknowledged can raise money in a sensible way -- and by doing some additional cuts, including making sure that we are reducing our health care spending, which is the main driver of our deficits, we can arrive at a package to get this thing done. I’m happy to have that conversation.What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people; the threat that unless we get our way, unless you gut Medicare or Medicaid or, you know, otherwise slash things that the American people don’t believe should be slashed, that we’re going to threaten to wreck the entire economy. That is not how historically this has been done. That’s not how we’re going to do it this time.Q: There’s no plan -- (off mic) -- you’re not searching for any other ideas, or are you --PRESIDENT OBAMA: What -- what -- what I’m --Q: -- let me ask -- (inaudible).PRESIDENT OBAMA: Chuck, what I’m saying to you is that there is no simpler solution; no ready, credible solution other than Congress either give me the authority to raise the debt ceiling, or exercise the responsibility that they have kept for themselves and raise the debt ceiling, because this is about paying your bills.Everybody -- everybody here understands this. I mean, this is not a complicated concept. You don’t go out to dinner and then, you know, eat all you want and then leave without paying the check. And if you do, you’re breaking the law.And Congress is -- should think about it the same way that the American people do. You don’t -- now if -- if Congress wants to have a debate about maybe we shouldn’t go out to dinner next time, maybe we should go to a more modest restaurant, that’s fine. That -- that’s a debate that we should have. But you don’t -- you don’t say, in order for me to control my appetites, I’m going to not pay the people who are provided me services, people who already lent me the money. That -- that’s not -- that’s not showing any discipline. All that’s doing is not meeting your obligations. You can’t do that.And -- and -- and -- and that’s not a credible way to run this government. We -- we’ve got to stop lurching from crisis to crisis to crisis when there’s this clear path ahead of us that simply requires some discipline, some responsibility and some compromise. That’s where we need to go. That’s how this needs to work.Major Garrett.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. As you well know, sir, finding votes for the debt ceiling can sometimes be complicated.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: You yourself, as a member of the Senate, voted against a debt ceiling increase.And in previous aspects of American history, President Reagan in 1985, President George Herbert Walker Bush in 1990, President Clinton in 1997 all signed deficit reduction deals that were contingent upon or in the context of raising the debt ceiling.You, yourself, four times have done that. Three times, those were related to deficit reduction or budget maneuvers. What Chuck and I and, I think, many people are curious about is this new adamant desire on your part not to negotiate when that seems to conflict with the entire history of the modern era of American presidents in the debt ceiling and your own history in the debt ceiling. And doesn’t that suggest that we are going to go until a default situation? Because no one is talking to each other about how to resolve this.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, no, Major. I -- I think if you look at the history, getting votes for the debt ceiling is always difficult, and budgets in this town are always difficult. I went through this just last year, but what’s different is we never saw a situation, as we saw last year, in which certain groups in Congress took such an absolutist position that we came within a few days of defaulting. And you know, the fact of the matter is, is that we have never seen the debt ceiling used in this fashion, where the notion was, you know what, we might default unless we get a hundred percent of what we want. That’s hasn’t happened.Now, as I indicated before, I’m happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits further in a sensible way. Although one thing I want to point is that the American people are also concerned about how we grow our economy, how we put people back to work, how we make sure that we finance our workers getting properly trained and our schools are giving our kids the education we deserve. There’s a whole growth agenda which will reduce our deficits that’s important as well.But what you’ve never seen is the notion that has been presented so far, at least, by the Republicans, that deficit reduction will only count spending cuts, that we will raise the deficit -- or the debt ceiling dollar for dollar on spending cuts. There are a whole set of rules that have been established that are impossible to meet without doing severe damage to the economy.And so what we’re not going to do is put ourselves in a position where in order to pay for spending that we’ve already incurred that our two options are we’re either going to profoundly hurt the economy and hurt middle-class families and hurt seniors and hurt kids who are trying to go to college or, alternatively, we’re going to blow up the economy. We’re not going to do that.Q: (Off mic) -- whatever Congress says, you’re OK with it?PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, not whatever Congress says. I mean, they’re going to send me something that’s sensible. And we shouldn’t be doing this --Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: -- then we should -- and we shouldn’t be doing this on a one-to-three-month time frame. Why would we do that? This is the United States of America, Major. What, we can’t manage our affairs in such a way that we pay our bills and we provide some certainty in terms of how we pay our bills? Look, I don’t think anybody would consider my position unreasonable here. The -- I have --Q: (Off mic) -- talk about this on a daily basis because if default -- (off mic) -- why not talk about it --PRESIDENT OBAMA: Major, the -- I am happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits. I am not going to have a monthly or every three months conversation about whether or not we pay our bills because that in and of itself does severe damage.Even the threat of default hurts our economy. It’s hurting our economy as we speak. We shouldn’t be having that debate. If we want to have a conversation about how to reduce our deficit, let’s have that.We’ve been having that for the last two years. We had -- just had an entire campaign about it. And by the way, the American people agreed with me that we should reduce our deficits in a balanced way that also takes into account the need for us to grow this economy and put people back to work.And despite that conversation and despite the election results, the position that’s been taken on the part of some House Republicans is that no, we got to do it our way. And if we don’t, we simply won’t pay America’s bills. Well, you know, that can’t be -- that can’t be a position that is sustainable over time. It’s not one that’s good for the economy now. It’s certainly not going to be the kind of precedent that I want to establish, not just for my presidency but for future presidents -- even if it was on the other side. Democrats don’t like voting for the debt ceiling with a Republican’s president, and yet you -- you -- but you -- but you never saw a situation in which the Democrats suggested somehow that we would go ahead and default if we didn’t get a hundred percent of our way. That’s just not how it’s supposed to work.Jon Karl.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. On the issue of guns, given how difficult it will be, some would say impossible, to get any gun control measure passed through this Congress, what are you willing or able to do using the powers of your presidency to act without Congress? And I’d also like to know, what do you make of these long lines we’re seeing at gun shows and gun stores all around the country? I mean, even in Connecticut, applications for guns are up since the shooting in Newtown.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, my understanding is, the vice president’s going to provide a range of steps that we can take to reduce gun violence. Some of them will require legislation; some of them I can accomplish through executive action.And so I’ll be reviewing those today, and as I said, I’ll speak in more detail to what we’re going to go ahead and propose later in the week.But I’m confident that there are some steps that we can take that don’t require legislation and that are within my authority as president. And where you get a step that has the opportunity to reduce the possibility of gun violence, then I want to go ahead and take it.Q: Any idea of what the time frame for that is?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think, for example, how we are gathering data, for example, on guns that fall into the hands of criminals and how we track that more effectively -- there may be some steps that we can take administratively, as opposed -- through legislation.As far as people lining up and purchasing more guns, you know, I think that we’ve seen for some time now that those who oppose any common-sense gun control or gun safety measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government’s about to take all your guns away. And you know, that -- there’s probably an economic element to that. It obviously is good for business.But I think that, you know, those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship -- they don’t have anything to worry about. The issue here is not whether or not we believe in the Second Amendment.The issue is, are there some sensible steps that we can take to make sure that somebody like the individual in Newtown can’t walk into a school and gun down a bunch of children in a -- in a shockingly rapid fashion? And surely we can do something about that.And -- but -- you know, but -- but part of the challenge that, you know, we confront is, is that even the sight -- slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area stands this notion that somehow here it comes and that everybody’s guns are going to be taken away.It’s unfortunate, but that’s the case, and if you look at -- over the first four years of my administration, we’ve tried to tighten up and enforce some of the laws that were already on the books. But it’d be pretty hard to argue that somehow gun owners have had their rights infringed.Q: (Off mic) -- irrational fear that’s driving all these people to go and -- (off mic) --PRESIDENT OBAMA: Excuse me?Q: Do you think it’s an irrational fear -- (off mic) --PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I said, I think it’s a fear that’s fanned by those who are -- are worried about the possibility of any legislation getting out there.Julianna Goldman.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. I want to come back to the debt ceiling, because in the summer of 2011, you said that you wouldn’t negotiate on the debt ceiling, and you did. Last year you said that you wouldn’t extend any of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and you did. So as you say now that you’re not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling this year, why should House Republicans take that seriously and think that if we get to the one-minute-to-midnight scenario that you’re not going to back down?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, Julianna, let’s take the example of this year and the fiscal cliff. I didn’t say that I would not have any conversations at all about extending the Bush tax cuts. What I said was, we weren’t going to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. And we didn’t.Now, you can argue that during the campaign I said -- I set the criteria for wealthy at 250(,000 dollars) and we ended up being at 400(,000 dollars), but the fact of the matter is, millionaires, billionaires are paying significantly more in taxes, just as I said. So for -- for -- you know, from the start, my concern was making sure that we had a tax code that was fair and that protected the middle class, and my biggest priority was making sure the middle-class taxes did not go up.You know, the difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we’ve already made $1.2 trillion in cuts. And at the time, I indicated that there cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth. I said at the time I think we should pair it up with revenue in order to have an overall balanced package. But my own budget reflected cuts in discretionary spending. My own budget reflected the cuts that needed to be made. And we’ve made those cuts.Now, the challenge going forward is that we’ve now made some big cuts, and if we’re going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way. The alternative is for us to go ahead and cut commitments that we’ve made on things like Medicare or Social Security or Medicaid, and for us to fundamentally change commitments that we’ve made to make sure that seniors don’t go into poverty or that children that are disabled are properly cared for.For us to change that contract we’ve made with the American people, rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they don’t need, that points to a long-term trend in which, you know, we have fundamentally, I think, undermined what people expect out of this government, which is that parties sit down, they negotiate, they compromise, but they also reflect the will of the American people, that you don’t have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time, or otherwise threaten that we destroy the American economy.Another way of putting it is, we got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again. And now we -- now’s as good of a time as any, at the start of my second term, because if we continue down this path, then there’s really no stopping the principle. I mean, literally -- even in divided government, even where we’ve got a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate, then a small group in the House of Representatives could simply say, you know, every two months, every three months, every six months, every year, we are going to more and more change the economy in ways that we prefer, despite strong objections of Americans all across the country, or otherwise we’re going to have America not pay its bills.And you know, that is no way for us to do business.And by the way, I would make the same argument if it was a Republican president and a Republican Senate and you had a handful of Democrats who were suggesting that we are going to hijack the process and make sure that either we get our way a hundred percent of the time or otherwise, you know, we are going to default on America’s obligations.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, no, look, what I’ve said is is that I’m happy to have a conversation about deficit reduction.Q: So you technically are willing to negotiate.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Nope. Julianna, look, this is pretty straightforward. Either Congress pays its bills, or it doesn’t. Now, if -- and they want to keep this responsibility. If John Boehner and Mitch McConnell think that they can come up with a plan that somehow meets that their criteria that they’ve set for why they will -- when they will raise the debt ceiling, they’re free to go ahead and try. But the proposals that they’ve put forward in order to accomplish that only by cutting spending means cuts to things like Medicare and education that the American people profoundly reject.Now, if they think that they can get that through Congress, then they’re free to try. But I think that a better way of doing this is to go ahead and say, we’re going to pay our bills; the question now is how do we actually get our deficit in a manageable, sustainable way. And that’s a conversation I’m happy to have.All right, Matt Spetalnick.Q: Thank you, sir. You’ve spoke extensively about the debt ceiling debate, but some Republicans have further said that they’re willing to allow a government shutdown to take place rather than put off deep spending cuts. Are you prepared to allow the government to grind to a halt if you disagree with the spending cut proposals they put forth? And who do you think the American people would blame if that came to pass?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, ultimately Congress makes the decisions about whether or not we spend money and whether or we keep this government open. And if the Republicans in Congress have made a decision that they want to shut down the government in order to get their way, then they have the votes at least in the House of Representatives, probably, to do that. I think that would be a mistake. I think it would be profoundly damaging to our economy. I think it would actually add to our deficit because it will impede growth. I think it’s shortsighted.But they’re elected representatives, and folks put them into -- into those positions, and they’re going to have to make a decision about that.And I don’t -- I suspect that the American people would blame all of Washington for not being able to get its act together.But -- but the larger issue here has to do with what is it that we’re trying to accomplish. Are we trying to reduce the deficit? Because if we’re trying to reduce the deficit, then we can shape a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. I mean, is that -- is that really our objective? Our concern is that we’re spending more than we take in, and if that’s the case, then there’s a way of balancing that out so that we take in more money, increasing revenue, and we reduce spending. And -- and there’s a recipe for getting that done.And in the conversation that I had with Speaker Boehner before the end of the year, we came pretty close. I mean, a few hundred billion dollars separating us, when stretched out over a 10-year period, that’s not a lot.But it seems as if what’s motivating and propelling at this point some of the House Republicans is more than simply deficit reduction. They have a particular vision about what government should and should not do. So they are suspicious about government’s commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat or whether we should be spending money on medical research. So they -- they got a particular view of what government should do and -- and should be.And that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign. I think every poll that’s out there indicates that the American people actually think our commitment to Medicare or to education is really important, and that’s something that we should look at at as a last resort in terms of reducing the deficit, and it makes a lot more sense for us to close, for example, corporate loopholes before we go to putting a bigger burden on students or seniors.But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the government to see if they can get their way on it, that’s their -- that’s their prerogative. That’s how the system is set up. It will damage our economy. You know, the -- the government is a big part of this economy.And it’s interesting that a lot of times you have people who recognize that when it comes to defense spending, you know, some of the same folks who say, we got to cut spending or complain that, you know, government jobs don’t do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is -- this is pretty important part of the economy in my district and we shouldn’t stop spending on that; let’s just make sure we’re not spending on those other folks.Q: (Off mic)?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, my -- you know, look, my hope is, is that common sense prevails, you know? That’s always my -- my preference, and I think that would be the preference of the American people, and that’s what would be good for the economy.So -- so let me just, you know, repeat: If the issue is deficit reduction, getting our deficits sustainable over time, getting our debt in a sustainable place, then Democrats and Republicans in Congress will have a partner with me. We can achieve that and, you know, we can achieve it fairly quickly. I mean, we know what the numbers are; we know what needs to be done. We know what a balanced approach would take, and we’ve already done probably more than half of the deficit reduction we need to stabilize the debt and the deficit. There’s probably been more pain and drama in getting there than we needed.And so finishing the job shouldn’t -- shouldn’t be that difficult if everybody comes to the -- the conversation with an open mind and if we recognize that there are some things, like not paying our bills, that -- that should be out-of-bounds.All right? I’m going to take one last question. Jackie Calmes.Q: Thank you, Mr. President.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yep.Q: I’d like to ask you, now that you’ve reached the end of your first term, starting your second, about a couple of criticisms, one that’s long-standing, another more recent.The long-standing one seems to have become a truism of sorts, that you’re -- you and your staff are too insular, that you don’t socialize enough. And the second, the more recent criticism, is that you’re team taking shape isn’t diverse -- isn’t as diverse as it could be or even was in terms of getting additional voices, gender, race, ethnic diversity. So I’d like you to address both of those.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Sure. Let me take the -- the -- the second one first. You know, I’m very proud that in the first four years we had as diverse, if not more diverse, a White House and a Cabinet than any in history. And I intend to continue that because it turns out that when you look for the very best people, given the incredible diversity of this country, you’re going to end up with a diverse staff and diverse -- a diverse team, and that very diversity helps to create more effective policymaking and better decision-making for me because it brings different perspectives to the table.So if you think about my first four years, the person who probably had the most influence on my foreign policy was a woman. The people who were in charge of moving forward my most important domestic initiative, health care, were women. The person in charge of our homeland security was a woman. My two appointments to the Supreme Court were women. And 50 percent of my White House staff were women. So I think people should expect that that record will be built upon during the next four years.Now, what, I’ve made four appointments so far? And one woman, admittedly a high-profile one, is leaving the -- has already left the administration, and I have made a replacement.But I would just suggest that everybody kind of wait until they’ve seen all my appointments, who’s in the White House staff and who’s in my Cabinet, before they rush to judgment.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: But I -- I guess what I’m saying, Jack, is, is that I think until you’ve seen what my overall team looks like, it’s premature to assume that somehow we’re going backwards. We’re not going backwards, we’re going forward.With respect to this truism about me not socializing enough and patting folks on the back and all that stuff, most people who know me know I’m -- I’m a pretty friendly guy. And I like a good party. And you know, the truth is that, you know, when I was in the Senate, I had great relationships over there, and up until the point that I became president, this was not an accusation that you heard very frequently.I think that -- I think that really what’s gone on in terms of some of the paralysis here in Washington or difficulties in negotiations just have to do with some very stark differences in terms of policy, some very sharp differences in terms of where we stand on issues. And you know, if you think about, let’s say, myself and Speaker Boehner, I like Speaker Boehner personally. And you know, when we went out and played golf, we had a great time, but that didn’t get a deal done in 2011. You know, when I’m over here at the congressional picnic and folks are coming up and taking pictures with their family, I promise you, Michelle and I are very nice to them, and we have a wonderful time -- (scattered laughter) -- but it doesn’t prevent them from going under the floor of the House and, you know, blasting me for being a big-spending socialist.You know -- and the reason that, you know, in many cases, Congress votes the way they do, or talks the way they talk, or takes positions and negotiations that they take -- it doesn’t have to do with me, it has to do with the imperatives that they feel in terms of their own politics, right? They’re worried about their district. They’re worried about what’s going on back home. I think there are a lot of Republicans at this point that feel that, given how much energy has been devoted in some of the media that’s preferred by Republican constituencies to demonize me, that it doesn’t look real good socializing with me. Charlie Crist down in Florida, I think, testifies to that, and I think a lot of folks say, well, you know, if we look like we’re being too cooperative or too chummy with the president, that might cause us problems. That might be an excuse for us to get a challenge from somebody in a primary. So that tends to be the challenge.I promise you, we invite folks from Congress over here all the time. And I -- and when they choose to come, I enjoy their company. Sometimes, they don’t choose to come, and that has to do with the fact that I think they don’t consider the optics useful for them, politically.And -- and ultimately the way we’re going to get stuff done -- personal relationships are important, and obviously I can always do a better job, and the nice thing is, is that now that my girls are getting older, they don’t want to spend that much time with me anyway. (Laughter.) So I’ll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with or something, OK, I -- because I’m getting kind of lonely in this big house.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: So maybe -- maybe a whole bunch of members of the House Republican caucus want to come over and socialize more.But my suspicion is, getting the issues resolved that we just talked about, the big stuff -- whether or not we get sensible laws passed to prevent gun violence, whether or not America’s paying its bills, whether or not we get immigration reform done -- all that’s going to be determined largely by where the respective parties stand on policy and, maybe most importantly, the attitude of the American people. Now if the American people feel strongly about these issues and they push hard and they reward or don’t reward members of Congress with their votes; if -- you know, if -- if -- if they reject sort of uncompromising positions or sharp partisanship or always looking out for the next election, and they reward folks who are trying to find common ground, then I think you’ll see behavior in Congress change. And that will be true whether I’m the life of the party or a stick-in- the-mud.All right. Thank you very much, everybody.Copyright © 2013 by Federal News Service, LLC, 1120 G Street NW, Suite 990, Washington, DC 20005-3801 USA.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/us/colorado-may-pass-major-gun-control-legislation.html,"DENVER — With politicians in Washington deeply divided over new gun regulations, an urgent national debate ignited by the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary School is storming into state legislatures across the country. And nowhere is that debate more emotionally charged or politically consequential than here in Colorado, a reluctant crucible for the battle over guns.This state, one of hunters and sport shooters, has endured two of the most horrific mass shootings in American history, and this year for the first time in more than a decade it could pass major gun-control legislation.Gun-control advocates say it is a moment forged in part by the massacre inside a suburban Denver movie theater in July that left 12 people dead and dozens wounded. But it is also one created by demographics, of population shifts that have nudged the political center left while transforming traditionally rural, conservative swaths of the West.“We’ve had it with mass shootings,” said Beth McCann, a Democratic state representative. “People just don’t want to hear about another massacre. This is enough.”To lawmakers and advocates on both sides of the debate, Colorado is becoming a national test case for what kind of gun regulations — if any — can gather support from lawmakers, law enforcement officials and a public whose relationship with guns has been forged by tradition as much as tragedy.This is a place where even the horrors of the 1999 attack at Columbine High School in suburban Denver only temporarily shifted the debate on guns. In 2000, Colorado voters passed new restrictions on purchases made at gun shows, but a few years later, the General Assembly relaxed gun laws by making it easier for people to carry concealed weapons and limited the ability of towns and cities to pass strict gun laws.Gun ownership here crosses generations and political divisions. Liberal Denver lawyers own handguns, and the Democratic governor takes his son to hunting safety classes. A popular family shooting range sits in the center of Cherry Creek State Park, drawing some sport shooters who voted for President Obama, others who insist he is a communist.As legislators across the country reconvene, heavily Democratic states like New York, New Jersey and California are considering proposals to restrict assault weapons and ammunition that are far more aggressive than anything likely to pass in Colorado, even with Democrats in control of the Statehouse.Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a first-term Democrat, has called for universal background checks of private, individual gun sales, in addition to the checks now required at gun shows and at retail establishments. But in an interview, he said he was unsure about proposals from Democratic lawmakers to ban high-capacity ammunition magazines.“Even saying that puts some people into a frenzy,” Mr. Hickenlooper said. “People in the West have a very strong, deeply anchored belief in people’s right to bear arms.”That division came into sharp relief when Mr. Hickenlooper called for universal background checks in his State of the State address on Thursday. Democrats in one half of the chamber leapt to their feet and applauded while members of the Republican minority sat in stony silence.Democratic lawmakers have not formally introduced their gun-control measures, but have said they are writing bills that would create background checks for private, person-to-person sales and restrict high-capacity magazines like those used by the gunman in the movie theater, in Aurora.Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a national gun-control organization, has hired a Denver lobbying firm to support new gun-control laws here.State Senator Greg Brophy, a Republican, said the attention from outside groups would make Colorado “ground zero for gun control in the United States.”Republican supporters of gun rights have bristled at the push for tighter gun laws. One of the first bills introduced in the legislature would allow teachers with concealed-weapons permits to carry guns inside their classrooms (with a school district’s permission). Mr. Brophy was one who recoiled at the universal background checks, saying the only way to enforce such a system would be to require all gun owners to register their firearms.“That is the most onerous regulation ever conceived of in this country outside the outright confiscation of firearms,” he said. “Even if I want to loan a shotgun to my nephew to take out pheasant hunting, I can’t do that. I don’t think they realize here in Colorado just how dangerous that proposal is to liberty.”The prospect of stricter gun laws has sent gun sales soaring, and unleashed a torrent of new applications for background checks and concealed-carry permits. The Colorado Bureau of Investigation, which runs the checks, has a backlog of nearly 11,000 applications, and wait times have reached unprecedented levels.Across the country, the battle over guns is pulling states in sharply different directions. While Democratic-controlled states are pushing for greater restrictions on ammunition, assault weapons and tougher background checks, lawmakers in Mississippi are considering changes to the state’s concealed weapons bill that are backed by the National Rifle Association.And Wyoming’s Republican-dominated Legislature is considering a bill to block any new federal restrictions on semiautomatic guns or ammunition magazines.“These weapons they’re trying to eliminate are something we hold dear in the Western United States,” said State Representative Mark Baker of Sweetwater County, in southern Wyoming. “We’re trying to let the federal government know ahead of time we’re not going to allow you to enforce your laws and regulations on our state land.”Colorado still embraces its history of rugged individualism and the range, but it has never been as conservative as some of its neighbors.“I do think it is important for people to understand that even though we are a Western state and there is a libertarian strain here, I think sometimes people think the gun lobby is maybe more powerful here than it really is,” said Bill Ritter Jr., a Democratic former governor and a hunter who pointed out that he had been elected despite an F rating from the N.R.A.And as the gun debate moves ahead, some of the most influential voices may not belong to lobbyists or lawmakers but to relatives who lost their sons and daughters, husbands and wives in the library of Columbine and in Theater 9 in Aurora. For months, several of these families have been huddling with lawmakers and making public appearances to call for tighter background checks and measures to keep guns away from people with mental illnesses.“It’s different now because children are being butchered in schools,” said Dave Hoover, a police officer in Lakewood, Colo., whose nephew A. J. Boik was one of the 12 people killed in Aurora. “Because kids were killed at a movie. Because families went to church and were gunned down.”He added: “I don’t understand why we are even arguing about this.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/movies/awardsseason/a-night-for-saluting-women-at-the-golden-globes.html,"At a time when President Obama is under attack for appointing so many white men — and so few women — to senior positions in the White House, Hollywood seemed intent Sunday on correcting the imbalance at the Golden Globes.Ricky Gervais took the awards to the edge of puerile bullying three years in a row, but Tina Fey and Amy Poehler brought charm and easy good humor to a ceremony where stars are supposed to relax and have fun.And it was one of the more amusing awards shows because of it. The two comedians were gentle — up to a point. In their opening, Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler pointed out Kathryn Bigelow and made a joke about the controversy over her film “Zero Dark Thirty.” Ms. Poehler said, “When it comes to torture, I trust a lady who spent three years married to James Cameron.” The camera panned to stars looking a little shocked as they laughed.It wasn’t the only Girl Power moment. Former President Bill Clinton was met with a standing ovation when he arrived to introduce the Steven Spielberg film “Lincoln.” But it was Ms. Poehler who got the biggest laugh when she returned to the stage and said rapturously, “That was Hillary Clinton’s husband.”Female wunderkinds of every age seemed to dominate the night, including Jodie Foster, a former child star who was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award, and the newcomer Lena Dunham, the creator and star of “Girls.”Ms. Foster, long reticent about her personal life, gave a brilliant, somewhat incomprehensible soliloquy that was almost a coming-out speech, but then veered away. (It was like Garbo talks, then Garbo is garbled.) Ms. Dunham accepted for best actress in a TV comedy by saying somewhat tremulously that other, more senior nominees for the award, like Ms. Fey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, were the comfort of her youth. Ms. Fey underlined the slight by saying sarcastically, “Congratulations, Lena, I’m glad we got you through middle school.”Julianne Moore, who won best actress in a television movie for her depiction of Sarah Palin in the HBO film “Game Change,” made a point of saluting two women who had nothing to do with the film but everything with exposing Ms. Palin’s weaknesses: Ms. Fey, who impersonated Ms. Palin on “Saturday Night Live,” and Katie Couric, whose interviews with Ms. Palin during the 2008 election campaign provided Ms. Fey with raw material for her parody.And one of the most unlikely star turns was by Aida Takla O’Reilly, the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group that is often mocked but is not known for having a sense of humor. Ms. Takla O’Reilly said, “I know that Jeffrey Katzenberg will never forget my name, because he never knew it in the first place.”In so many studied efforts at levity, lapses are all the more glaring. British actors are known for their witty good manners at awards shows, but Damian Lewis, who won best actor in a TV drama for “Homeland,” thanked many colleagues and friends but didn’t even mention his co-star, Claire Danes — one of the more startling omissions since Hilary Swank forgot to thank her husband at the time, Chad Lowe. (When Ms. Dunham was onstage after winning the award for best comedy or musical TV series, she made an oblique reference to that slip, joking, “I also promised myself that if I ever got this chance, I would thank Chad Lowe.”)Most of the women were studiously gracious in victory (except the pop singer Adele, who used a rather salty Britishism to describe how much she was enjoying the show). While accepting her award, Jennifer Lawrence made a joke about beating out Meryl Streep, but praised her co-star Bradley Cooper and also the producer Harvey Weinstein, whom she thanked for “killing whoever you had to kill to get me up here today.” Anne Hathaway, who won for best supporting actress in a movie, even reached out to one of her rivals for the award, thanking Sally Field, nominated for playing the president’s wife in “Lincoln,” for being “a vanguard against typecasting” by going from “The Flying Nun” to “Norma Rae.” (Ms. Hathaway rose to fame as the star of “The Princess Diaries.”)And it could be that all the female success has left a pall on some of the men.On the red carpet before the show Jay Leno gave the hosts of the night a backhanded compliment: he called Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler “two of the funniest women I know,” then added of Ms. Poehler’s sitcom: “ ‘Parks and Recreation’ is my wife’s favorite show. She never misses it.”Ms. Poehler had the last laugh, closing the show by saying of herself and Ms. Fey, “We’re going home with Jodie Foster.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/opinion/one-republican-steps-forward.html,"Until now, the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, has not seen a single member of his caucus dare to buck his fierce opposition to a law requiring fuller disclosure of campaign contributions. But last month, Senator Lisa Murkowski, Republican of Alaska, broke through the partisan wall to propose a badly needed mandate for transparency by the growing army of unrestricted, unidentified donors who underwrite attack ads and other stealth tactics that have so disfigured American politics.The measure, co-sponsored by Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, would require any campaign organization spending $500 or more on federal political activity to disclose who its donors are, and to do so in “real time” at every point, from “candidacy to advocacy.”Ms. Murkowski learned about the power of unscrupulous money the hard way in 2010 when she lost her party’s nomination for re-election because of a last-minute flood of primary ads from the Tea Party and other activists that distorted her record. She responded by waging a difficult write-in campaign that led to her being re-elected with a fresh sense of independence that has been put to good use in her campaign-disclosure proposal.The measure would also require “joint regulations and guidance” from the Internal Revenue Service and the Federal Election Commission to close the legal loopholes that enable dark-money campaign operations. This is a needed prod, since the commission is stultified by the inaction of its Republican members and the I.R.S. is too slow to challenge political front groups. A prime example is the $70 million spent by Karl Rove’s transparently political Crossroads GPS organization, which ludicrously claimed tax-exempt status under the Internal Revenue Code as a “social welfare” activity.Ms. Murkowski’s move should be welcomed by Democrats like Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, sponsor of a worthy donor-disclosure measure that was blocked last July by blanket Republican opposition. A companion bill was just reintroduced in the House by Chris Van Hollen, Democrat of Maryland, because last year’s “unprecedented secret spending” can only grow worse in future elections."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/nyregion/thompsons-mayoral-campaign-raises-1-million-in-6-months.html,"In his strongest fund-raising showing yet, William C. Thompson Jr., who lost the mayor’s race to Michael R. Bloomberg in 2009, announced on Monday that his campaign had collected more than $1 million in the last six months.The figure — which did not include any details on spending — easily topped the amounts collected by his likely rivals for the Democratic nomination for New York City mayor. Then again, Mr. Thompson, a former city comptroller, had lagged behind the others in previous cycles, and was under the most pressure to demonstrate some momentum heading into the 2013 election.In a statement, Mr. Thompson said that he was “encouraged by this strong show of support” to “help us kick-start our campaign.”Mr. Thompson, who has raised approximately $2.5 million to date, still needs to continue to raise funds aggressively to qualify for the maximum possible amount of public money under the city’s voluntary and relatively generous campaign finance program. The program will allow candidates to spend no more than $6.73 million each in the primary, in part from money they raise and in part from matching funds.One likely contender, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, has already reached the maximum for both the primary and a possible runoff. But even with her fund-raising operation scaled back, she still reported raising $473,000 in the last six months, ending on Jan. 11.Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, had another solid showing, pulling in $725,000, or just shy of his total during the previous cycle. He is also on track, aides say, to reach the maximum soon.John C. Liu, the comptroller, collected $522,000, and now has more than $2 million. But he evidently spent far more than anyone else in the last six months — $345,000, with much of that going to legal fees stemming from a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising. Two allies of Mr. Liu’s are slated to go on trial next month.On the Republican side, George T. McDonald, an advocate for the homeless and the founder of the Doe Fund, reported raising $277,000. But it was not immediately clear how much of that was his own money.Figures for all the candidates in this year’s elections, including spending and other details, will be released by Tuesday by the city’s Campaign Finance Board. All 59 of the city’s top elected offices will be on the ballot."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/politics/biden-meets-with-house-democrats-on-gun-violence-proposals.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama this week will embrace a comprehensive plan to reduce gun violence that will call for major legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases and lay out 19 separate actions the president could take by invoking the power of his office, lawmakers who were briefed on the plan said Monday.Lawmakers and other officials said that the president could use a public event as soon as Wednesday to signal his intention to engage in the biggest Congressional fight over guns in nearly two decades, focusing on the heightened background checks and including efforts to ban assault weapons and their high-capacity clips. But given the difficulty of pushing new rules through a bitterly divided Congress, Mr. Obama will also promise to act on his own to reduce gun violence wherever possible.Actions the president could take on his own are likely to include imposing new limits on guns imported from overseas, compelling federal agencies to improve sharing of mental health records and directing the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to conduct research on gun violence, according to those briefed on the effort.White House aides believe Mr. Obama can also ratchet up enforcement of existing laws, including tougher prosecution of people who lie on their background checks.At a news conference on Monday, exactly one month after the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Obama said a task force led by Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. had “presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn’t happen again. He added: “My starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works.”The administration’s strategy reflects the uncertainty of gun politics in America and the desire by White House officials to address the Connecticut shooting while also confronting the broader deficiencies in the country’s criminal justice and mental health systems.By proposing to use the independent power of his office, Mr. Obama is inviting political attacks by gun owners who have already expressed fear that he will abuse that authority to restrict their rights. Representative Steve Stockman, Republican of Texas, threatened Monday to file articles of impeachment if the president seeks to regulate guns with executive orders. “I will seek to thwart this action by any means necessary,” Mr. Stockman said in a statement.White House officials and Democratic lawmakers said that there are clear limits to what the president can and cannot do, and that Mr. Obama has no plans to push beyond what he would need Congressional authority to accomplish.On Capitol Hill, Mr. Obama’s legislative effort will face intense opposition from gun rights groups, including the National Rifle Association, and the lawmakers they support with millions of dollars at election time and who see gun rights as a defining issue in their districts. But Mr. Obama’s allies see a rare opening for tighter gun rules after Congress has shied away from the politically charged issue for years.“He’s putting together a pretty comprehensive list of what could be done to make a difference in this area,” said Representative Mike Thompson of California, who is heading a Democratic task force in the House. “There’s some huge, huge holes in the process that are set up to keep communities safe. We need to close those holes.”Representative Jackie Speier, Democrat of California, said Vice President Biden had informed lawmakers during a two-hour briefing on Monday that there are “19 independent steps that the president can take by executive order.” Ms. Speier said the executive action is part of the “most comprehensive gun safety effort in a generation.”Rahm Emanuel, the mayor of Chicago and Mr. Obama’s former chief of staff, joined the debate on Monday and said that the president should “clear the table” by doing whatever he can administratively so small issues do not get in the way of the bigger legislative fights over access to guns.“Don’t allow a side issue to derail these things,” Mr. Emanuel said during a discussion about gun policy. While many gun control advocates are eager to harness what they believe is a ripe moment in American life for new and robust restrictions on the kinds of guns that were used in Newtown, there is an emerging consensus on Capitol Hill and among gun education groups that improving the system of background check legislation that currently exempts private gun sales and gun shows is the most viable legislative route to pursue.“The assault-weapons ban is a low priority relative to the other measures the Biden task force is considering,” Matt Bennett, a spokesman for Third Way, a left-leaning research group, said after hearing from Mr. Biden last week. “Political capital in the gun debate only goes so far. We think it should be spent on things that would have the greatest impact on gun violence, like universal background checks and cracking down on gun trafficking.”Any efforts to get gun legislation through Congress will require an enormous and ceaseless pressure campaign by the administration. Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden are likely to keep up the pressure on lawmakers with public events in the weeks and months ahead, according to those familiar with the White House strategy.Scores of senators, including many Democrats, will be wary of voting on any effort to curb access to guns or ammunition. Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, is a longtime supporter of gun rights. Still, gun legislation is likely to begin in the Senate because the House is controlled by Republicans, many of whom oppose new restrictions on guns.With fiscal issues continuing to dominate the political calendar for the next several weeks, White House officials and lawmakers say the gun safety effort is likely to be debated in separate pieces of legislation that could be introduced over time. In coming weeks, Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, will reintroduce a measure that would require every gun buyer, with limited exceptions, to undergo a background check and would force states to feed all relevant data into the background check system so those with criminal convictions and the mentally ill could be flagged."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/senator-wyden-asks-john-brennan-for-legal-opinions-on-killings-of-americans.html,"WASHINGTON — A Democratic member of the Senate Intelligence Committee demanded Monday that he and other committee members be allowed to review secret Justice Department legal opinions justifying the killing of American citizens in counterterrorism operations.In a letter to John O. Brennan, President Obama’s counterterrorism adviser and his nominee for C.I.A. director, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon said he had asked repeatedly but unsuccessfully to see the legal opinions, though he added that he had been given “some relevant information on the topic.”The administration has fought in court to keep such legal opinions secret, including one justifying the killing of Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born cleric and Al Qaeda propagandist who was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011. A federal judge in Manhattan ruled on Jan. 2 against the American Civil Liberties Union and The New York Times, which sought the opinions under the Freedom of Information Act and plan to appeal the ruling.Mr. Wyden called the administration’s current stance “unacceptable.” He wrote that only by reviewing the exact language of the legal opinions could he know “whether the president’s power to deliberately kill American citizens is subject to appropriate limitations.”The White House declined to comment. Administration officials, including Mr. Brennan, have given a series of public speeches discussing the legal basis for drone strikes, even as they have declined to release the actual legal opinions.Mr. Wyden did not threaten to block Mr. Brennan’s confirmation, which is expected to get Senate approval. The Intelligence Committee has set a confirmation hearing for Feb. 7.In his letter, Mr. Wyden told Mr. Brennan that he also wanted to discuss the committee’s still-classified 6,000-page report on the C.I.A.’s use of coercive interrogations under President George W. Bush. He said that the report revealed that “the C.I.A. repeatedly provided inaccurate information about its interrogation program to the White House, the Justice Department and Congress,” and that he wanted Mr. Brennan’s views on how to correct what he called past inaccurate statements about the interrogation program.Mr. Wyden also requested several other documents he said he has sought without success, including a list of countries in which the intelligence agencies have carried out lethal operations.While only Mr. Wyden signed the letter, the Democratic chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, has previously called on the administration to make public the legal opinion justifying the Awlaki strike and said that she, too, intends to question Mr. Brennan about the report on C.I.A. interrogations."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/opinion/when-malis-democracy-ended-the-atrocities-followed.html,"IN 2005, after the world failed to prevent mass atrocities in Rwanda, the Balkans and Darfur, the United Nations declared that nations had a responsibility to protect populations everywhere from genocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity.It is a fine idea, but not easy to implement, especially in Africa. There, frail democracies too often fall victim to corruption, social division, greed and dictatorship. So there, especially, the world needs to add another “responsibility to protect” — a duty of democratic nations to safeguard popular rule in neighboring lands. Too often, a failure of democracy is what starts a country down the road to atrocities. The failure this year to protect and restore democracy in Mali is a perfect case in point. Less than a year after a coup last March, Mali has slid into a devilish civil war and national breakup accompanied by reports of war crimes, atrocities and crimes against humanity. The coup did not cause the current rebellion in the north, but it allowed it to succeed, with hundreds of thousands of people forced to leave their homes. In addition, more than 4.6 million people are at risk of running out of food when the war and drought are both taken into account, the United Nations has said.Last summer, Human Rights Watch was reporting “the use and recruitment of child soldiers, looting and the pillaging of hospitals, schools, aid agencies ... public floggings and amputation ... rape and abduction of girls and women.” Amnesty International was urging he International Criminal Court to investigate “killings, rapes and torture and other possible crimes.” But the world, and the region, kept dithering until the rebels who had seized the mostly Arab north seemed about to expand their reach into the sub-Saharan south.That finally brought a direct response from France last week, and a sudden new interest by Western nations in implementing, at last, a regional West African military intervention against the rebels. In fact, the 15 countries in the Economic Community of West African States, along with the African Union, had been seeking permission to intervene since early last summer, but a major stumbling block was the coup leaders’ fear that the foreign military forces might undermine their own firm grip on the country; in the face of this, the decision-making process of the United Nations Security Council moved at a crawl. The picture might have been different had Mali’s neighbors intervened more decisively against the coup in the first place. At this time last winter, Mali was widely admired as a successful democracy. But then heavily armed fighters from North Africa’s nomadic Tuareg group, having failed to keep Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in power in Libya, crossed into the Arab northern half of Mali and joined forces with Islamist rebels, some of them from Algeria. It became clear within weeks that they were outperforming Mali’s army.But rather than focus the army’s efforts more effectively against the rebels, and perhaps appeal for outside aid, Capt. Amadou Sanogo and other military officers turned their forces against Mali’s elected president, Amadou Toumani Touré, and seized power, blaming the civilian leaders for Mali’s weakness.Mali’s neighbors condemned the coup and suspended aid. But after a month — which would have been a good moment to restore the constitutional order — they foolishly agreed to negotiate with Captain Sanogo, rather than insist that he quit power and leave the country until peace and democracy were restored. After that, the Security Council frittered away the summer, saying it needed more information before it would grant African nations a mandate to intervene militarily.The hesitation only emboldened the rebels. While Captain Sanogo agreed under pressure to the appointment of an interim government and started a wave of repression against his political opponents, the rebels conquered the northern half of Mali and declared it independent. Reports of inhuman applications of Shariah law, like amputations as punishment for theft, followed, continuing into the fall and winter.So now, from their failure to protect democracy in Mali, the West African nations, and with them the West, have reaped a heavier responsibility — the duty, laid out by the United Nations at a global summit meeting in 2005, to protect “populations from genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.” The task is far more complicated than it would have been last spring. Under international pressure for change, Mali acquired new civilian leaders, but leaders of the coup were involved in the selection process, and the new government cannot be said to have been elected freely and democratically. And yet, the first task ahead of all of Mali now, and of those from outside who would help it, is not the restoration of democracy but primarily the restoration of Mali itself — its central state authority and territorial integrity. First the rebels must be driven from control in the north; only then can the country start a truly democratic process, in which all citizens of Mali can choose their next leaders in free, fair and internationally supervised elections.In fact, Mali is not the first African country in which a failure to protect the constitutional order or quickly restore an overthrown democracy opened a path for grave atrocities. In Kenya, a disputed election in 2007 was followed by violence in which more than 1,000 people were reported to have died and 500,000 others were displaced. In Guinea, a coup in 2009 was followed by the killing of more than 150 opponents of the junta. In Ivory Coast, Laurent Gbagbo refused to relinquish the presidency in 2010 after losing an election; mass atrocities followed. It took a civil war to dislodge him the following spring. Finally, late in 2011, he was turned over to the International Criminal Court to be tried for crimes against humanity.So, how can the concept of responsibility to protect democracy be further developed?Where institutions and traditions prove no match for a crisis of democracy, the region or the continent should step in. The African Union’s charter already empowers that organization to intervene to prevent war crimes and genocide, and it condemns “unconstitutional changes of government.” Such ideals need to be invoked boldly and quickly; that may be the strongest argument for a new doctrine of a responsibility to protect democracy, with a protocol for military or other forms of firm coercion when diplomacy fails.Member states will not always agree on when to intervene, of course. But having a clear responsibility to do so in extreme cases would make prompt action more likely, by adding a sense of urgency. And it would help the United Nations Security Council play its own important role — by bringing the five permanent members into unison to avoid blocking or delaying a lifesaving intervention.In addition, the International Criminal Court should announce that it will seek to punish all those responsible for any coup d’état that results in war crimes or crimes against humanity. In Mali and across Africa, the evidence shows that a failure of democracy is all too likely to lead quickly to such crimes."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/politics/no-labels-sponsors-meeting-aimed-at-fixing-congress.html,"About a dozen members of Congress gathered in a Midtown Manhattan hotel ballroom on Monday, an intentional remove from the marbled corridors of the United States Capitol, to chew over some uncomfortable questions: Why are we so ineffective? Why can’t we manage to be the least bit civil to one another? And why does America hate us?“Did you hear about the poll?” asked Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania. “Congress is now rated slightly above or below cockroaches and colonoscopies.” (Actually, it was below.)This being a fairly self-aware group, there were plenty of explanations.“We are incentivized to do crazy things,” said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut, who pointed out how angry diatribes delivered on the House floor made celebrities out of lawmakers.Representative Peter Welch, Democrat of Vermont, bemoaned how each party ignores the truth when it does not suit its purpose. “Congress is a fact-free zone,” he declared.These members of Congress, who were brought together by the group No Labels, which calls itself a bipartisan citizens’ movement, have plenty of serious ideas about how to address these problems. For example, they would require Congress to work a five-day week instead of their customary three or four. The group also called for not paying Congress if it cannot pass a budget and for banning the signing of any pledges.But whether or not the 24 representatives and senators recruited so far can persuade more colleagues to join their cause is another problem altogether. And even if they do that, convincing a skeptical public that they are more than just the latest do-gooders calling for political “Kumbaya” is a tough sell.They are already facing difficult questions about whether they are just another Washington policy group that will hold conferences and churn out position papers but achieve little.Asked at a news conference what their first step would be once they left the hotel on Monday afternoon, Representative Janice Hahn, Democrat of California, had an answer that might have struck some as less than inspiring: more meetings.“I hope when we leave here we can, first and foremost, continue meeting together, continue talking about the potential big ideas that we might tackle,” she said. “And then I hope we recruit more members.”Could they name a bill or an idea that they all agreed on? “We haven’t had that discussion,” Mr. Welch said.Would they disclose No Labels’ donors? After an official from the organization told a reporter that she would have to follow up on that, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah and Republican presidential candidate and now a national co-leader of No Labels, stepped in to say that he would have no problem with full disclosure. “Transparency is an important overriding philosophy for us,” he said.Many members of No Labels are new to Congress, like Senator Angus King of Maine, an independent who was elected in November. “Will this organization work?” Mr. King asked. “We don’t know. This is unchartered territory.”Arriving in Washington, many members had the same reaction as their constituents to the workings of Congress: they were appalled. Everything from how bills seemed to pass only under the duress of a deadline to the lack of social interaction across party lines was unusual, they said.Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, who has been in the Senate for two years and is the other national leader of No Labels, with Mr. Huntsman, acknowledged: “We have no relationships. You know this is the first time some of us have met each other?”Representative Jack Kingston, Republican of Georgia, summed up the promise the group’s philosophy offers with a story about how he once shared a ride with Representative James P. Moran, Democrat of Virginia. After they got to talking, he said, he actually grew fond of his political adversary.“That’s the problem with No Labels,” he said in a videotaped message. “You start liking people.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/world/africa/denis-mukwege-doctor-who-aids-rape-victims-returns-to-congo.html,"BUKAVU, Democratic Republic of Congo — It was as if someone extraordinarily famous had come to town. Thousands of people craned their necks as the motorcade roared by, cellphones out to grab a snap, an air of expectation and excitement eclipsing all the street noise of clanging Coke bottles and beeping motorcycles.“There he is!” someone yelled. “Le docteur!”In the back of a white truck — zooming past so fast it spewed clouds of dust — sat a kind-faced man staring out at the crowds: Denis Mukwege, a gynecological surgeon renowned for repairing the insides of thousands of brutally raped women. He returned home triumphantly on Monday after more than two months in exile after nearly being assassinated, possibly for speaking out on behalf of the countless women who have been gang-raped by armed groups that stalk the hills of eastern Congo.Congo, torn by war for years and traumatized by dictators for decades, is desperate for heroes. So perhaps it is no surprise that Dr. Mukwege carries such an enormous amount of pride — and hope — on his rounded shoulders, which are most often covered by a white lab coat. For around 15 years now, he has kept a major hospital running in one of the most turbulent parts of the country, sometimes performing as many as 10 operations a day, on women who have been raped so viciously that they stumble in with death trudging just a few steps behind.Susannah Sirkin, deputy director of Physicians for Human Rights, which provides help to Dr. Mukwege’s Panzi Hospital, said it “stands out as a center of excellence for others to emulate and replicate across his country and beyond.”For his work, Dr. Mukwege has won many human rights awards and is often mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Peace Prize. The American playwright Eve Ensler, who works closely with Dr. Mukwege, called him a “spiritual force.”Banners with messages like “We are behind you” flew all across Bukavu on Monday. One man wore a shirt that said, “Welcome our Superman.”The obvious love and support for Dr. Mukwege among the people here make it all the more difficult to discern who was behind the assassination attempt on a night last October, when four armed men slipped into his house in Bukavu and waylaid him as he drove in. When his trusted guard jumped out to confront the attackers, the gunmen shot him in the head. With bullets flying, Dr. Mukwege, 57, threw himself to the ground, and the attackers fled. Less than a week later, he escaped to Belgium with his wife and two daughters.The local authorities say they do not know who tried to kill him. But many of his supporters have their suspicions. A month earlier, Dr. Mukwege had delivered a powerful speech at the United Nations in which he denounced mass rape in Congo and railed against his own government — which has a record of silencing critics — for allowing it to occur with impunity, to the point that the United Nations has called Congo “the rape capital of the world.”He has also criticized Rwanda for fomenting chaos in Congo. Bukavu, though, is relatively safe. A sprawling, disheveled city hunched over Lake Kivu, one of the most beautiful bodies of water in Africa, it has a thin blue haze from thousands of cooking fires. But around the city, in just about every direction, lurk men with guns.As Dr. Mukwege’s truck pulled into Panzi Hospital on Monday, a crowd of women — many of them rape victims — burst into song. People yelled “Hallelujah!” One delegation of women from an island in Lake Kivu presented Dr. Mukwege with all he needed to survive for a few days — a bucket of charcoal, several cabbages, pineapples, onions and a gigantic pumpkin.“We don’t need the military or Monusco,” said one woman, referring to the United Nations mission in Congo. “We women will protect you.”Some people who had stood for hours under the sun were now huddled in the rain, waiting to hear him speak.Overwhelmed by the outpouring of emotion, Dr. Mukwege mopped his face with his sleeve and stepped to the podium.“The power of darkness will be defeated,” he called out to wild cheers. But he also asked people to forgive, saying, “We must respond to violence with love.”The doctor’s friends say United Nations officials and the Congolese authorities have reassured Dr. Mukwege that he is now safe in Bukavu, which is why he returned to continue his work.The authorities in Bukavu said there is nothing to worry about. “Our methods are invisible, but we will protect him,” said Etienne Babunga, a local security official. “Anyway, who would want to kill him? He’s just a doctor.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/us/politics/marco-rubio-pushes-republican-party-on-immigration-changes.html,"As President Obama and Democratic leaders are preparing a major push to overhaul the immigration system, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida is asserting his leadership among Republicans on the volatile issue, previewing a proposal that includes measures to give legal status to millions of illegal immigrants.Mr. Rubio, a Cuban-American in his first term whose star is rising rapidly in his party, has outlined views in recent days that set him apart from many other Republican conservatives, who reject any legalization as a form of amnesty that rewards immigrant lawbreakers. Mr. Rubio said he would not rule out some kind of legal status for immigrants in the United States illegally, although he insists that any measures should not penalize immigrants who have tried to come here through legal channels.Mr. Rubio described his proposals in interviews last week with The Wall Street Journal editorial page and with The New York Times. By Monday he was already gathering support, as Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, a conservative who was the Republicans’ vice-presidential nominee last year, endorsed Mr. Rubio’s ideas.Mr. Rubio laid out three: aside from fair treatment for foreigners who play by the rules, he said, any legislation should also recognize that legal immigration has been a boon to the United States in the past and is “critical to our future.” He would also insist on new measures to ensure strict enforcement at the border and within the country.“We can’t have the kind of vibrant growth we need and the economy we want, based on limited government and free enterprise, if we don’t have a legal immigration system that works,” Mr. Rubio said. “And in order to have a system that works, we have to deal with those people who are already here illegally.”Mr. Ryan, on his Facebook page, wrote that Mr. Rubio was “exactly right on the need to fix our broken immigration system.”“I support the principles he’s outlined,” Mr. Ryan said, “modernization of our immigration laws; stronger security to curb illegal immigration; and respect for the rule of law in addressing the complex challenge of the undocumented population.”  As one of three Hispanics in the Senate, Mr. Rubio, who won his seat in 2010 with support from the Tea Party, seemed to be trying to set a new tone for his party to discuss immigration. Many Republican leaders have been reconsidering the party’s stance on the issue since the November election, when Latinos, the electorate’s fastest-growing group, overwhelmingly supported Mr. Obama.Strikingly, Mr. Rubio’s principles did not sound that different from proposals for an immigration overhaul by Mr. Obama, Democratic leaders and a handful of other Republicans. Aside from work under way at the White House on legislation, a bipartisan group of Senators has been meeting to draft a bill.Where Mr. Rubio differed significantly with Democrats was on the legal pathway illegal immigrants would follow, with him proposing a long and indirect course before some of those immigrants could apply to become American citizens.In a telephone interview, Mr. Rubio said a starting point for his plan was recognizing that the current immigration system was “burdensome, bureaucratic, difficult to navigate and sometimes it just doesn’t work.”Mr. Rubio said he would seek to reorient the visa system to bring in more educated immigrants with skills in technology and science. As for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, Mr. Rubio said, “We have to understand these folks are here to stay.” He added that most of them had not committed serious or violent crimes.“The right way to deal with them is not amnesty,” Mr. Rubio said, “and it is not a special pathway to citizenship.” Instead, he said, he would offer a provisional legal status to immigrants who passed criminal background checks, paid fines and passed English and civics tests.But, he said, “ultimately it’s not good for our country to have people permanently trapped in that status where they can’t become citizens.” After a certain period, he said, immigrants would be allowed to apply through the existing system to become legal permanent residents, a status that would eventually allow them to become citizens.The current system is clogged with huge backlogs, with some immigrants waiting as long as two decades to receive visas. Mr. Rubio said that potentially large flaw in his plan would be worked out in negotiations.Although Mr. Rubio said it would be better for Congress to take up the complex issues in separate pieces of legislation, he said he would not insist on that.Mr. Rubio said he would offer a faster track to citizenship for young undocumented immigrants who came here as children. Members of Mr. Rubio’s staff have been meeting with leaders of United We Dream, the largest organization of those young immigrants.“To me the most surprising thing was that he was talking about a pathway to citizenship,” Lorella Praeli, a leader of the organization, said on Monday. “There has been such a shift in the tone, in his vision.”Some conservative Republicans made it clear they would not support Mr. Rubio. In a statement, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama said Mr. Obama had undercut the chances for an overhaul by weakening enforcement. “If the administration had spent the last four years ending illegality instead of abetting it,” he said, “we would be in a better position for some kind of agreement.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/world/europe/shots-fired-at-office-of-greek-prime-minister.html,"ATHENS — Unidentified gunmen sprayed bullets into the headquarters of Greece’s governing New Democracy party in central Athens before dawn on Monday, adding to a wave of politically motivated violence in recent days as Greece struggles with its worst economic crisis in a decade.No one was injured in the attack, in which one bullet entered the office of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras.Though there was no public claim of responsibility for the shooting, the episode followed a spate of attacks on other symbols of the Greek establishment that are believed to have been carried out by far-left militant groups. Those attacks over the last week involved canister bombs detonated at several government offices, banks and the homes of five prominent journalists in Athens.A government spokesman warned on Monday of a “dangerous escalation of spreading terror.”Taken together, the episodes pointed to a rise in activism by far-left militant groups, after a similar rise over the past year on the far right, where the neofascist group Golden Dawn has carried out a series of attacks against immigrants.Mr. Samaras’s fragile coalition government has been rocked recently by accusations that it has failed to pursue rampant tax evasion by the wealthy and well-connected. The publication of a list of more than 2,000 Greeks with bank accounts in Switzerland, which the government was given but did little to investigate, has touched off a scandal and galvanized public opinion in recent weeks.The opposition Syriza party, which until recently was ahead of Mr. Samaras’s bloc in opinion polls, has sought to capitalize on public anger by pressing a series of parliamentary investigations into the matter. The party’s lead shrank when Mr. Samaras secured a payment of almost $47 billion from Greece’s international lenders last month, part of a bailout plan that Syriza has said it would try to scuttle if it wins power.Mr. Samaras, for his part, has pointed to outbreaks of violence as warnings of what could happen to the country if he were not in charge. “Democracy will not be terrorized,” he said on Monday.All of Greece’s opposition parties, including Syriza, Independent Greeks, Golden Dawn and the Communist Party, condemned the shooting attack on Monday.Urban political violence has tended to flare in Greece at moments of political chaos and economic deterioration. A group called November 17 mounted terrorist attacks against politicians and businessmen for decades after the fall of the country’s military junta in 1974; the police finally crushed that group in 2002, but others have sprung up since then, including anarchist groups that have sown chaos by attacking the police and throwing firebombs during anti-austerity demonstrations.The latest wave of violence began after dozens of suspected anarchists were arrested last week in a raid at the Villa Amalia, a longtime gathering point in central Athens for far-left groups and students. Firebombs were confiscated in the raid.Security guards at Mr. Samaras’s party offices saw two men emerge from a car shortly before 3 a.m. Monday and open fire, the police said. The offices were empty.State television reported on Monday that antiterrorism officers had joined the investigation, but the police did not publicly speculate about who might have been responsible for the shooting.A string of attacks involving homemade gas canister bombs on Friday that targeted five journalists was claimed by an anarchist group called Militant Minority-Lovers of Lawlessness. It cited Greek news media coverage that it saw as sympathetic to the austerity drive imposed by the government and its international creditors."

Within an hour, about 80 sympathizers had reoccupied the building, as a crowd of about 200 demonstrators chanted anti-government slogans outside the Athens police headquarters.Prime Minister Antonis Samaras’s government has vowed to clamp down on what it says is a wave of lawless behavior, a move that protestors said would be greeted with greater resistance.A similar sweep was conducted two weeks ago at another squat popular with radical leftists, a move that was met with outrage and soon followed by a spate of bombings at sites across Athens.Mr. Samaras was meeting with members of his governing coalition on Tuesday to discuss the growing outbreak of violence, which comes as his government grapples with accusations that it has failed to pursue rampant tax evasion by the wealthy and well-connected."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/opinion/president-morsis-repulsive-comments-against-jews.html,"When Mohamed Morsi became Egypt’s president in June, he rose, unknown and untested, from the Muslim Brotherhood to the leader of the most important Arab country. He has made missteps and some truly alarming decisions, but there was still reason to hope that he might grow into the job and become the kind of leader that could benefit Egypt and the region.His scurrilous comments from nearly three years ago about Zionists and Jews, which just came to light, have raised serious doubts about whether he can ever be the force for moderation and stability that is needed. As reported by David Kirkpatrick in The Times, Mr. Morsi is shown in a video from 2010 delivering a speech in which he urges Egyptians to “nurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred” for Jews and Zionists. In a television interview months later, he described Zionists as “these bloodsuckers who attack Palestinians, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs.”That kind of pure bigotry is unacceptable anywhere, anytime. But it is even more offensive in public discourse, coming from someone who became the president of a major country. Mr. Morsi’s comments deserve to be condemned unequivocally, as the Obama administration did on Tuesday. Jay Carney, the president’s spokesman, said, “We completely reject these statements.”The problem goes deeper than just Mr. Morsi, however. The remarks were made at a time when anti-Israel sentiment was running high in Egypt and the region after the three-week Gaza conflict in 2009 between Israel and Hamas. The sad truth is that defaming Jews is an all too standard feature of Egyptian, and Arab, discourse; Israelis are not immune to responding in kind either.Teaching children to hate and dehumanizing one’s adversaries is just the kind of twisted mentality that fuels the conflicts that torment the region.Does Mr. Morsi really believe what he said in 2010? Has becoming president made him think differently about the need to respect and work with all people? So far, there has been no official reaction.The White House called for Mr. Morsi to make clear that he respects members of all faiths and said the videotaped remarks run counter to the goal of peace. President Obama should also deliver that message to President Morsi directly."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/us/gun-imagery-fills-language-of-debate.html,"WASHINGTON — When the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence wanted to promote more restrictions on firearms after the Connecticut school shootings in December, it turned to a firm to help publicize its position. The firm’s name? Point Blank Public Affairs.When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. promised ideas for responding to the massacre, he said he was “shooting for Tuesday” — even as he warned that there is “no silver bullet” for stopping gun violence. When President Obama noted that he was reviewing those ideas, he said on a different topic that he would not negotiate “with a gun at the head.”No wonder it is hard to get rid of gun violence when Washington cannot even get rid of gun vocabulary. The vernacular of guns suffuses the political and media conversation in ways that politicians and journalists are often not even conscious of, underscoring the historical power of guns in the American experience. Candidates “target” their opponents, lawmakers “stick to their guns,” advocacy groups “take aim” at hostile legislation and reporters write about a White House “under fire.”The ubiquitous nature of such language has caused people on both sides of the emotional debate in recent weeks to take back, or at least think twice about the phrases they use, lest they inadvertently cause offense in a moment of heightened sensitivity.“It’s almost second nature,” said Andrew Arulanandam, director of public affairs for the National Rifle Association. “They’re such mainstream phrases, you almost have to check yourself and double-check yourself.”But it also says something about the long American romance with guns and the nation’s self image. “All of that ties into the frontier tradition, rugged individualism, a single American with a flintlock or a gun of some kind holding off the Indians or fighting off the British,” said Robert Spitzer, a scholar of gun control at the State University of New York at Cortland.While Mr. Spitzer called that more mythology than reality, even he found himself using such references in a recent speech responding to comments by Wayne LaPierre, the N.R.A.’s vice president, after the Sandy Hook Elementary School attack. “My opening line was, his speech was a misfire; he missed the target,” Mr. Spitzer recalled. “I liked using the gun metaphor because I think it’s doubly appropriate for him.”In that case, of course, he was doing it deliberately. And others use double entendre purposefully. The National Shooting Sports Foundation says on its Web site that it is “always shooting for more” to promote the future of sport shooting. For an editorial last week criticizing Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, for his past solidarity with the N.R.A., The New York Times used the headline, “Senator Reid Takes Fresh Aim.”But much of the time, such phrases come spilling out without apparent irony. Candy Crowley, the CNN anchor, introduced an interview by highlighting “our conversation with N.R.A. point man Asa Hutchinson.” Christiane Amanpour on the same network featured a story about a Tennessee lawmaker known for supporting gun rights. “So why did the N.R.A. take aim at her?” she asked.After Alex Jones, a gun rights advocate, erupted during an interview with Piers Morgan, the Internet lit up. As of Tuesday, the phrase “Alex Jones goes ballistic” drew 357,000 hits on Google.The Brady Campaign found itself in the awkward position of using a firm called Point Blank when it needed help last month. Point Blank, named for the Bruce Springsteen song, had an archery bull’s-eye on its Web site. But it has since dissolved and one of its principals, Debra DeShong Reed, has founded a new firm, called Five by Five Public Affairs, that is now working for the Brady Campaign.The Brady Campaign’s own name attests to the sensitivity of language in the gun debate. Gun control advocates these days generally do not use the term gun control; instead, they talk about curbing gun violence, recognizing that “control” stirs opposition among legal gun owners who fear their rights being trampled.The use of gun symbolism has at times provoked controversy. After Representative Gabrielle Giffords of Arizona was shot in the head by a gunman in 2011, many criticized Sarah Palin, the former vice-presidential nominee, for using cross hairs on her Web site to identify Democrats like Ms. Giffords who she said should be defeated for re-election.Gun control advocates like Mr. Obama and Mr. Biden tend to draw less criticism when they use the language of guns. “We know that there is no silver bullet,” Mr. Biden said last week about stemming gun violence. But he said he planned to present an array of ideas to Mr. Obama that he hoped would make a difference. “I’m shooting for Tuesday,” he said.At a news conference on Monday, Mr. Obama said he would review those ideas. But during a discussion on fiscal talks, he too used the terminology of firearms. “What I will not do is have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people,” he said.Gun control advocates said such lapses are not surprising. “We do it, too,” said Mark Glaze, director of Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an advocacy group co-founded by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York. “We notice and laugh, and we don’t think it goes to our core motivations. We kind of accept that there’s a piece of us that will always be based in the Old West.”Mr. Glaze said he had slipped plenty of times. “I stopped feeling guilty about it a while ago when one of the survivors we work with somehow managed to squeeze in at least four gun references into a sentence that had nothing to do with guns,” he said. “Since then, I’ve let it go.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/opinion/deafness-at-doomsday.html,"TEMPE, Ariz.TO our great peril, the scientific community has had little success in recent years influencing policy on global security. Perhaps this is because the best scientists today are not directly responsible for the very weapons that threaten our safety, and are therefore no longer the high priests of destruction, to be consulted as oracles as they were after World War II.The problems scientists confront today are actually much harder than they were at the dawn of the nuclear age, and their successes more heartily earned. This is why it is so distressing that even Stephen Hawking, perhaps the world’s most famous living scientist, gets more attention for his views on space aliens than his views on nuclear weapons.Scientists’ voices are crucial in the debates over the global challenges of climate change, nuclear proliferation and the potential creation of new and deadly pathogens. But unlike in the past, their voices aren’t being heard.Indeed, it was Albert Einstein’s letter to President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939, warning of the possibility that Hitler might develop a nuclear weapon, that quickly prompted the start of the Manhattan Project, the largest scientific wartime project in history. Then, in 1945, the same group of physicists who had created the atomic bomb founded the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists to warn of the dangers of nuclear weapons, and to promote international cooperation to avoid nuclear war. As Einstein said in May 1946, “The unleashed power of the atom has changed everything save our modes of thinking, and thus we drift toward unparalleled catastrophe.”The men who built the bomb had enormous prestige as the greatest physics minds of the time. They included Nobel laureates, past and future, like Hans A. Bethe, Richard P. Feynman, Enrico Fermi, Ernest O. Lawrence and Isidor Isaac Rabi.In June 1946, for instance, J. Robert Oppenheimer, who had helped lead the Manhattan Project in Los Alamos, N.M., argued that atomic energy should be placed under civilian rather than military control. Within two months President Harry S. Truman signed a law doing so, effective January 1947.Today, nine nuclear states have stockpiled perhaps 20,000 nuclear weapons, many of which dwarf the weapons dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Yet proliferation is as alarming as ever, even though President Obama signed, and Congress ratified, the new strategic arms-reduction treaty in 2010. Iran’s nuclear program could lead to conflict. So could the animosity between India and Pakistan, which both have nuclear weapons.The United States is complicit, because whatever our leaders may say, our actions suggest that we have no real intention to disarm. The United Nations adopted the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which would ban countries from testing nuclear weapons, in 1996. But it has not come into force; the Senate rejected ratification in 1999, and while President Obama has promised to obtain ratification, he has not shown enough urgency in doing so.What’s striking is that today’s version of the Manhattan Project scientists — not the weapons researchers at our maximum-security national laboratories, but distinguished scientific minds at our research universities and other national labs — provide advice that is routinely ignored.Last year, the National Academy of Sciences published a report demonstrating that all the technical preconditions necessary for ratifying the United Nations treaty were in place. But this vital issue did not come up in the presidential campaign and is barely mentioned in Washington. Another study by the academy last year, on flaws in America’s costly ballistic missile defense program, has had little impact even as the Pentagon considers cuts in military spending.I am co-chairman of the board of sponsors of the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, which has supported the call for a world free of nuclear weapons — a vision backed by major foreign policy figures in both parties. But ideological biases have become so ingrained in Washington that scientific realities are subordinated to political intransigence.Do scientists need to develop new doomsday tools before our views are again heard? Will climate researchers remain voiceless unless they propose untested geoengineering technologies that could have insidious consequences? Will biologists be heard only if their work spawns new biotechnologies that could be weaponized?Because the threat of nuclear proliferation is not being addressed, because missile defense technologies remain flawed and because new threats exposed by scientists have been ignored, the Bulletin’s annual Doomsday clock — which was updated on Tuesday — still sits at five minutes to midnight. The clock is meant to convey the threats we face not only from nuclear weapons, but also from climate change and the potential unintended consequences of genetic engineering, which could be misused by those seeking to create bioweapons.Until science and data become central to informing our public policies, our civilization will be hamstrung in confronting the gravest threats to its survival."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/world/africa/france-mali-intervention.html,"PARIS — France carried out new airstrikes overnight against Islamist fighters in central Mali, as Paris pledged on Tuesday to commit more troops to a potentially protracted campaign against extremists pressing south from a jihadist state they have forged in the desert north of the country.The assessment that the conflict could be long and perilous appeared to be reflected in a call by France on Tuesday for Arab support to bolster an African force to fight the insurgents.“We — not just the French, but all nations — have to combat terrorism,” Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said during a visit to the United Arab Emirates in the Persian Gulf, announcing that donors would meet later this month, probably in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, to discuss financing an offensive against the rebels in Mali, Reuters reported.“Everybody has to commit to oneself in fighting against terrorism,” Mr. Fabius said. “We are pretty confident that the Emirates will go into that direction as well.”On Monday, the extremists overran the central village of Diabaly just hours after Mr. Fabius said confidently that France had blocked “the advance of the terrorists,” accomplishing its first mission in the conflict.But the French defense minister acknowledged that the military situation was different. A column of militants had pushed to within about 50 miles of one of Mali’s largest cities, forcing France to evacuate its citizens in the area and bringing the Islamists a step closer to Bamako, Mali’s capital — closer, in fact, than they had been before French forces entered the fight.President François Hollande of France, who was also in the United Arab Emirates for a one-day meeting to discuss trade and the sale of advanced French Rafale warplanes, said on Monday that French jets had “hit their targets” in strikes on rebel forces.The impact of the strikes was not immediately clear. Seeking to turn back the rebels, France has conducted strikes using Mirage warplanes based in the central African nation of Chad and its air force has flown sorties from bases in France using Rafale warplanes, according to French news reports. It has also deployed attack helicopters against Islamist forces.“We will continue the deployment of forces on the ground and in the air,” Mr. Hollande said. “We have 750 troops deployed at the moment and that will keep increasing so that as quickly as possible we can hand over to the Africans.” French defense officials said the French force would be increased gradually to 2,500 soldiers, backed by armored vehicles.Mr. Hollande said a deployment of troops from West African states, to be supported by the French military, could take a “good week.”For its part, the United States has long pledged logistical support but no troops. West African nations have promised 3,300 soldiers to fight alongside the Malian Army, but they must be gathered, transported, trained and financed, and there have long been concerns about their readiness for the task ahead. The European Union has promised 250 military trainers to aid the Malian Army, but it has yet to deploy them, a decision that may not come before a special foreign ministers’ meeting later this week.The French mission is an ambitious one. Beyond pledging to stop the Islamists from pushing ever deeper into Mali — a more challenging task in itself than French officials initially suggested — France has also vowed to help restore Mali’s territorial integrity, an apparent reference to driving the Islamists out of their vast northern stronghold, an area twice the size of Germany. Having joined the war quickly after an urgent plea from the Malian government, France now finds itself facing a well-equipped force of Islamist fighters — with little immediate help from its allies to overcome them.Mr. Fabius said on Sunday that the French engagement would last only a matter of weeks, but as French forces wait for their African counterparts to ready themselves, Mr. Hollande may find it hard to keep his vow not to use French ground forces in northern Mali.Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French defense minister, said that the French forces had driven the Islamists out of one village, Konna, but that another column of Islamists had overrun the Malian Army in Diabaly on the western side of the Niger River, a loss Malian officials confirmed.“Diabaly is in the hands of the jihadists,” said the parliamentary deputy from the area, Benco Ba, on Monday evening. “They’ve burned the church, and they’ve burned the military camp. They’ve entered the houses of the families.”He said the Islamists had ordered the inhabitants to the village mosque, to pray. “We are completely taken aback by this, because there was an important military post there,” Mr. Ba said. He said the village had been infiltrated by foot and the invading force included many children, only 13 or 14 years.Eduardo del Buey, a United Nations spokesman, said Monday that an estimated 30,000 Malian civilians have been displaced since the latest fighting began last week.For now, the French are fighting only from the air in support of Malian troops, while also making airstrikes on northern extremist camps and strongholds deep inside Islamist-held territory, like Gao.Mr. Hollande’s move to help Mali has earned wide support abroad and in France itself, but he has warned that there could be consequences for the seven French hostages held by extremists in Mali and perhaps even prompt a heightened terrorist threat at home.France “has fallen into a trap which is much more dangerous than Iraq, Afghanistan or Somalia,” Oumar Ould Hamaha, an insurgent leader, told Europe 1 radio. Stirring longstanding fears that the far-flung military operation in Mali could inspire vengeance as far away as Europe, he warned that the intervention had “opened the gates of hell for all the French.”Still, France has considerable assets to bear, and will get help from Britain and other European allies, as well as accelerated help from the United States.On Monday, Leon E. Panetta, the United States defense secretary, said that assistance could include air and other logistical support, but Defense Department officials said no decisions had been made on whether to help with refueling planes midflight and air transport. American spy planes and surveillance drones are in the meantime trying to get a sense of the chaos on the ground.Mr. Panetta said that even though Mali was far from the United States, the Obama administration was deeply worried about extremist groups there, including Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. “We’re concerned that any time Al Qaeda establishes a base of operations, while they might not have any immediate plans for attacks in the United States and in Europe, that ultimately that still remains their objective,” he said.In Douentza, a town south of Gao but still inside Islamist-held territory, French strikes have driven the Islamists into the bush, said the parliamentary deputy from the region, Fatoumata Dicko. “We are breathing much easier now,” she said.On Sunday, Mr. Fabius, the French foreign minister, said the military effort had three goals: to “block the advance of the terrorists, which is done”; to restore Mali’s territorial integrity, “which will take more time”; and to secure the carrying out of United Nations Security Council resolutions on the Mali crisis.“If France had not intervened,” Mr. Fabius said, the rebels could have reached Bamako, with “appalling consequences” not only for the Malian population but also for the 6,000 French and other Western citizens living in the capital of the former French colony."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/us/politics/schumer-says-hes-satisfied-with-hagel-on-mideast.html,"WASHINGTON — In a boon for the Obama administration’s efforts to advance the nomination of Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York told President Obama on Tuesday that he was optimistic that he could vote for Mr. Hagel’s confirmation based on his grilling of Mr. Hagel on a variety of issues pertaining to Israel and Iran.After a 90-minute meeting in the West Wing of the White House on Monday, Mr. Schumer appeared to be mollified on a number of concerns he has with some votes Mr. Hagel made while serving in the Senate and myriad comments he has subsequently made regarding the nuclear threat of Iran and other matters.“Based on several key assurances provided by Senator Hagel,” Mr. Schumer said in a prepared statement, “I am currently prepared to vote for his confirmation. I encourage my Senate colleagues who have shared my previous concerns to also support him.” Mr. Schumer, the first senator to meet privately with Mr. Hagel since he was nominated last week, is likely to have influence over many of his Senate colleagues, particularly Democrats, who have been fretting over the nomination. He called Mr. Hagel Tuesday morning to let him know he was prepared to support him.While the nod is unsurprising, having the support of Mr. Schumer, the most influential Jewish member of the Senate, may be helpful to Mr. Hagel’s pursuit of the defense job, effectively neutralizing the idea that he is somehow anti-Israel. His nomination has been met with suspicion, and even outright hostility, among Republicans and Democrats who are strongly aligned with pro-Israel groups.Mr. Schumer himself appeared cool to the prospect of Mr. Hagel’s nomination in December interview on NBC’s “Meet the Press.”Of deepest concern to Mr. Schumer and many Israel advocacy groups, are Mr. Hagel’s positions on the nuclear threat posed by Iran, particularly his suggestions in the past that a military strike against Iran would be counterproductive. It is a position that is out of step with the Obama administration, which became increasingly hawkish on Iran during the 2012 campaign.“On Iran, Senator Hagel rejected a strategy of containment and expressed the need to keep all options on the table in confronting that country,” Mr. Schumer said. “But he didn’t stop there. In our conversation, Senator Hagel made a crystal-clear promise that he would do ‘whatever it takes’ to stop Tehran from obtaining nuclear weapons, including the use of military force.”As a Republican senator from Nebraska, Mr. Hagel voted against several rounds of sanctions against Iran that ultimately passed the Senate, citing unilateral sanctions are ineffective. On this matter too, Mr. Schumer seemed to find comfort. “Senator Hagel clarified that he ‘completely’ supports President Obama’s current sanctions against Iran,” Mr. Schumer said. “He added that further unilateral sanctions against Iran could be effective and necessary.”On nearly every other issue that Mr. Schumer brought up with Mr. Hagel — his views on the militant Islamist groups Hezbollah and Hamas, his prior comments about gays, his use of the term “Jewish lobby” to refer to Israel advocacy groups — all seemed to be tamped down in the meeting.“I know some will question whether Senator Hagel’s assurances are merely attempts to quiet critics as he seeks confirmation to this critical post,” Mr. Schumer said. “But I don’t think so. Senator Hagel realizes the situation in the Middle East has changed, with Israel in a dramatically more endangered position than it was even five years ago.”On Sunday, Mr. Hagel got a resounding vote of support from a fellow Republican moderate, Colin L. Powell, the former secretary of state, who said on the NBC News program “Meet the Press” that Mr. Hagel was “superbly qualified.” Mr. Powell’s remarks could well influence many Republicans who have expressed skepticism about his confirmation, although some, like Senator John McCain of Arizona, are almost certain to continue to express opposition.Mr. Hagel offered to discuss these matters with Mr. Schumer over the phone last week, but the senator wanted to hold out for a discussion in person. Mr. Schumer, who appears to enjoy his role in the catbird seat on the Hagel matter, will also likely help to tamp down criticisms from some groups aligned with Israel, who are not eager to have a fight with the newly re-elected president."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/nyregion/house-passes-50-7-billion-in-hurricane-aid.html,"WASHINGTON — After fierce lobbying by political leaders in states across the Northeast, the House of Representatives on Tuesday night approved a long-awaited $50.7 billion emergency bill to provide help to victims of Hurricane Sandy.The aid package passed 241 to 180, with 49 Republicans joining 192 Democrats. The Senate is expected to pass the measure, and President Obama has expressed support for it.The $50.7 billion — along with a nearly $10 billion aid package that Congress approved earlier this month — seeks to provide for the huge needs that have arisen in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states since the hurricane struck in late October.The emergency aid measure would help homeowners whose homes have been damaged or destroyed, provide assistance to business owners who experienced losses as well as reinforce shorelines, repair subway and commuter rail systems, fix bridges and tunnels, and reimburse local governments for emergency expenditures.Though the package does not cover the entire $82 billion in damage identified by the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, leaders from the storm-ravaged region expressed relief over the action in the Republican-controlled House, where storm aid had become ensnared in the larger debate over spending and deficits.Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island who helped press his party’s leadership into holding the vote, hailed the package’s passage as a victory for storm victims but expressed disappointment over the House’s failure to act earlier.“It is unfortunate that we had to fight so hard to be treated the same as every other state has been treated,” Mr. King said.Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who is part of the chamber’s leadership, said he would urge the Senate to approve the House bill even though he believed it fell short of what the Senate approved last year. “It is certainly close enough,” he said, comparing the bills.The developments in the House settle, at least for now, an issue that had become an embarrassment for the chamber’s Republican leadership and had pitted Northeastern Republicans eager to help their constituents against fiscal conservatives bent on taming the nation’s deficits.The vote was scheduled over a week ago by Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, after he came under intense criticism for concluding the business of the previous Congress without taking up a $60.4 billion hurricane-aid bill that the Senate had approved.His critics included influential Republicans in and out of Congress, including Mr. King and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.In a statement, Mr. Christie joined with Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, both Democrats, to express gratitude to the Congress for providing the relief to hurricane victims.The $50.7 billion package was presented on the floor in a carefully structured legislative approach that reflected the political sensitivities surrounding the issue. House leaders first offered a $17 billion bill and then a $33.7 billion amendment that was written by New Jersey and New York Republicans. The approach allowed House conservatives to vote for some of the assistance while lowering the total cost. Most of the money, included in the amendment, ultimately needed Democratic votes to be added to the final package and then passed.In the debate leading up to passage of the aid package, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York, argued that House should have acted sooner. “Residents have been suffering for two-and-a-half months,” she said. “We need the aid. We need it now.”As the debate unfolded through the afternoon and into the evening, lawmakers from the region found themselves on the defensive at times, forced to beat back a barrage of amendments that sought to cut items out of the overall package or that demanded cuts in other programs to pay for the package.The most controversial of the amendments was offered by a group of conservative lawmakers who sought to pay for the aid package with across-the-board spending cuts to various programs in the 2013 federal budget.Critics called the amendment a poison pill, given that it would almost certainly doom the overall package’s prospects of passage in the Senate, controlled by Democrats. But the amendment’s backers said it was merely meant to clamp down on runaway spending and deficits.“This amendment is not about offering a poison pill,” said Representative Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina and the amendment’s author. “I want the money to go where it needs to go.”The amendment was defeated 258 to 162, with 70 Republicans joining 188 Democrats to beat it back."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/nyregion/cuomo-raises-nearly-22-5-million-for-re-election-campaign.html,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s campaign reported nearly $22.5 million in the bank on Tuesday, a formidable war chest that could scare off potential rivals when he seeks re-election next year.Mr. Cuomo continued to focus his fund-raising on well-heeled donors — real estate developers in particular.His donors from the industry included Aby Rosen ($23,000), principal of RFR Holding, a development and property management company; Rita Castagna ($50,000) of Castagna Realty; and Barry M. Gosin ($50,000), chief executive of Newmark Grubb Knight Frank, a commercial real estate adviser. He also received $50,000 from Kenneth and Winston Fisher, two real estate developers.The governor’s top donor appears to have been Leonard Litwin, another real estate developer, who donated $250,000, according to an analysis by the New York Public Interest Research Group. Even though Mr. Litwin’s name does not appear in Mr. Cuomo’s campaign filings, he donated through a host of limited-liability companies that he controls. Over the past two years, he has donated $500,000 to the governor.Over all , Mr. Cuomo raised $4 million in the past six months and spent close to $900,000. While his fund-raising for the reporting period was slower than usual, it came amid Hurricane Sandy. And it did not represent much of a problem: Mr. Cuomo already has enough in the bank to put him in an enviable position for his 2014 campaign.“It’s almost as much as he would need to spend on an entire campaign,” said Bill Mahoney, research coordinator for the New York Public Interest Research Group. Of the slowing fund-raising, Mr. Mahoney said, “Part of that is he’s already raised the maximum from many of his donors.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/politics/obama-presses-senate-to-confirm-atf-director.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama indicated on Wednesday that along with asking Congress to pass measures like an assault weapons ban, he would be increasing pressure on lawmakers to do something they have refused to do for the past six years: confirm a permanent director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.At a news conference, the president unveiled a series of executive actions and legislative proposals to help reduce gun violence, and he said he would nominate the agency’s acting director, B. Todd Jones, to be its permanent leader.“Congress needs to help, rather than hinder, law enforcement as it does its job,” Mr. Obama said on Wednesday.Mr. Jones, 55, a former Marine who is also the United States attorney in Minnesota, has led the beleaguered agency since August 2011, when he was appointed by the administration to take over in the aftermath of the scandal surrounding the bungled gun trafficking investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious, in which agents lost track of firearms they were allowing to pass into Mexico.Until 2006, the president had the power to install a director of the firearms bureau without Congressional approval. But under pressure from gun lobbyists, Congress changed the law that year to require Senate confirmation. Since then, the Senate has failed to confirm any nominee by either President George W. Bush or Mr. Obama as senators who support gun rights have used their powers to delay nomination votes; Mr. Jones is the bureau’s fifth acting director since 2006.One of the more vocal critics of the Justice Department and the firearms agency, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said Wednesday that he agreed with the president that it was time for the Senate to confirm a permanent director of the agency, but he raised questions about Mr. Jones’s credibility.“The new nominee, B. Todd Jones, is a familiar face to the committee, but his ties to the Fast and Furious scandal raise serious questions,” Mr. Grassley said.“In any case, he’ll receive a thorough and fair vetting by the Judiciary Committee,” said Mr. Grassley, the committee’s senior Republican.For years, the A.T.F. has been battered by scandals and has had its authority undercut by gun lobbyists, who have pushed to limit its power and cut its funding. The bureau most recently came under scrutiny in 2011 for its handling of Fast and Furious after; two of the firearms used in the investigation were found at the scene of a shootout in which a United States Border Patrol agent was killed in Arizona.Mr. Jones said in a meeting with reporters in September that during his tenure the agency had refocused its efforts on fighting violent crime and was “recalibrating” how it did business by revamping its policies and procedures.“We are well on our way to tightening up our unity of effort and our communications,” Mr. Jones said, adding that senior officials in Washington now had more oversight over the agency’s field offices.Mr. Jones said that some procedures had not been updated in 15 to 20 years.“We are back to the basics, and that is what I have been working very hard at, the fundamentals,” he said, “and the fundamentals for us is protecting the American public from violent crime.”Mr. Jones has told the agency’s offices to work closely with police departments in large cities to combat sudden increases in crime and “to focus on cases that will have the greatest impact,” a senior agency official said in a recent interview.This year, A.T.F. agents have been part of so-called surges of law enforcement officers in the country’s most violent cities, including Oakland, Calif., and Philadelphia, working to make arrests and seize guns."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/fashion/a-list-guide-to-the-inauguration-parties.html,"WHEN aides to President Obama announced that there would be only two official inaugural balls this weekend — the fewest in recent memory — Washington insiders and veteran partygoers shrugged.And it wasn’t because the first couple remain relatively detached from the social life of the nation’s capital.Everyone knows that the best inauguration parties aren’t the government balls but the private fetes that fill museums and restaurants, tie up car services, throw caterers and celebrity wranglers into high gear, and turn Washington into something like Fashion Week or the Oscars for the style challenged.“The official balls are for people coming in from out of town,” said Kevin Chaffee, an editor of Washington Life, the society magazine. “Visitors have to go home and say they attended one. But old Washington hands know to go to smaller parties that will be well done.”Or as Diana McLellan, the retired society columnist put it, “People spend a lot of money and time getting dressed to go, but even the best official balls are enormous scrums.” In particular, she remembers the one (and only one) given by Jimmy Carter, which was called a “party” rather than a “ball” to assuage recessionary guilt. It was in Union Station before it was renovated.“And all there was to eat were peanuts,” she said. “It was like going to hell.”Well, nobody ever said Washington was an easy town. That’s especially true during fiscally tricky times, which may explain the difficulties that the president’s inaugural committee had raising $50 million for festivities, after the most expensive presidential race in history.Nor is the capital in a particularly jolly mood — what with all the fiscal drama, contested appointments and a Congress so embittered that it makes the one depicted in “Lincoln” look like a garden club. And let’s not overlook the fact that second inaugurations should be more subdued, “a little bit like a second wedding” according to The Washington Post Magazine.But never mind. Even with fewer attendees expected, and the news this week that the Washington power couple Tony and Heather Podesta are divorcing, it’s still a festive week for all kinds of party animals, especially of the Democratic persuasion. Here’s a selective and highly curated list.1. HOT LISTThe power brokers atop the invitation should be a tip off — Buffy and Bill Cafritz, Ann and Vernon Jordan, Vicki and Roger Sant — for one of the most coveted tickets in town. Their 2009 edition was so star-studded — Tim Geithner here, Tom Brokaw, Ben Bradlee and Eli Broad there — that the Clintons couldn’t make it 10 feet past the door. And at least one movie star, an organizer claimed, was turned away. It wasn’t Glenn Close. She was inside.Dolley Madison Ballroom at the Madison, 1177 15th Street, NW; Sunday, 9:30 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Invitation only.2. BIG TICKETWith tickets starting at $10,000 a pair, expect the  Creative Coalition’s Inaugural Ball  to attract high-rollers and notable names, even if not quite like in 2009. The Goo Goo Dolls play this time for guests including Paula Abdul, Eric Stonestreet, John Leguizamo, Giancarlo Esposito and Johnny Galecki. Oh, and Tim Daly, too. He’s the president — of the Creative Coalition, that is.Harman Center for the Arts, 610 F Street, NW; Monday from 9 p.m. Tickets from $10,000 a pair.3. BOY BAND ALERTMichelle Obama and Jill Biden headline the Kid’s Inaugural concert, hosted by the presidential inauguration committee and held in honor of military families.

Washington Convention Center, 801 Mount Vernon Place, NW; Saturday from TBD. Invitation only.4. DON’T MESS WITH TEXASWhile there are only two official balls, there’s no shortage of state society balls.And veterans know that these state balls have more food, drink and chances to hobnob with members of Congress. The standout is the Black Tie & Boots Inaugural Ball, sponsored by the Texas State Society of Washington, which promises six stages with performers, and truckloads of Texan food and drink. Gowns for women and tuxedos and boots for men suggested. Cowboy hats optional.Gaylord National Resort and Convention Center (National Harbor, Maryland); Saturday, 7 p.m. to 3 a.m. $250 members; $275 for nonmembers (texasstatesociety.org).5. LADIES WHO BRUNCH?Google is toning things down from its 2009 inaugural bash, which featured dancing, a game room and big names like Ben Affleck, John Cusack and Craig Newmark (of Craigslist). This time, the search engine (which has a big legislative agenda) is partnering with Elle and the Center for American Progress for a Leading Women in Washington brunch, toasting the record number of new congresswomen, many of whom are expected to attend. No binders full of women here, just the real thing.National Portrait Gallery, Eighth and F Streets, NW; Sunday, noon to 3 p.m.: Invitation only. 6. LATINO VOTES AND VOICESLast fall, activists took the Kennedy Center to task for only including two Hispanics — Plácido Domingo and Chita Rivera — among its 186 honorees since 1978. Now a committee has been formed to address the issue. By happy coincidence (or is it?), Latinos take center stage for “ In Performance at the Kennedy Center,” hosted by Eva Longoria and others.

It’s with Pharrell Williams, John Legend and Malin Akerman, along with Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia and Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa of Los Angeles. Both are invitation only, with doors opening at 11 p.m – unimaginably late – by D.C. standards.  "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/world/europe/berlusconi-stirs-up-elections-in-italy.html,"ROME — The dark, double-breasted suits have long been a mainstay, but now former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has taken to wearing the occasional fedora. It lends him a rakish, retro air as he embarks on what many Italians, foreign investors and no doubt Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany hoped would never happen: another election campaign.In recent weeks, Mr. Berlusconi, a center-right candidate, has blitzed the airwaves with a theatrical blend of anti-establishment populism, this from someone who governed Italy for the better part of the last decade. His prime targets are Prime Minister Mario Monti, a well-behaved technocrat now vying to retain his post, and Ms. Merkel, cast as the taskmaster of the austerity that is suffocating southern Europe.With every hour that he appears on television, the medium he knows best and that made him rich, Mr. Berlusconi rises in opinion polls. His People of Liberty party is now in second place, after the center-left Democratic Party and before Mr. Monti’s nascent and still incoherent centrist bloc. They are trailed by the grass-roots Five Star Movement of Beppe Grillo, a comedian, which has tapped into a groundswell of antipolitical sentiment.Analysts widely agree that there is little chance Mr. Berlusconi will govern Italy again after elections scheduled for February. But they say he is likely to win enough seats in Parliament to achieve his goals: protecting his interests on issues like justice reform, digital television rights and wiretap laws — and weakening the center-left Democratic Party and Mr. Monti.“It’s a very confusing time,” said Giuliano Ferrara, the editor of the conservative daily newspaper Il Foglio and a sometime Berlusconi adviser. “People don’t want the insider,” he said of Mr. Berlusconi, “and they don’t want the outsider,” he added of Mr. Monti.Mr. Berlusconi, a skilled campaigner, has cast himself as an outsider while making an “insider” of Mr. Monti, who was lionized when he first took office in November 2011 precisely because he was seen as apolitical.Despite his many legal tangles and the dire performance of Italy’s economy under his leadership, Mr. Berlusconi maintains a residual popularity through charm, mastery of the media and a lack of strong competing parties.Last week, Mr. Berlusconi appeared for two hours on a television program hosted by one of his old enemies. Questioned about the number of politicians with criminal records elected on his party’s slate over the years, Mr. Berlusconi said he had not sought them out. “You take 100 priests and you don’t find 100 saints,” he said.“This country is ungovernable!” he said with glee at one point, only to be reminded that his governments had the largest majority in postwar Italian history. At another moment, Mr. Berlusconi stood up in outrage and threatened to leave but eventually calmed down, deftly taking out a white handkerchief to brush off his chair before sitting back down.The show drew nine million viewers, a quarter of the Italian audience share.“He’s an ex-prime minister who is doing showman’s gags on television,” said Marco Damilano, a political correspondent for L’Espresso, a left-wing weekly magazine, whom Mr. Berlusconi cheerfully pretended to hit on the head with a poster on a television program on Tuesday.Always a savvy populist, Mr. Berlusconi now rails against the fiscal consolidation policies advocated by Germany, sounding not unlike the leftist Syriza party in Greece, which leads in opinion polls there. He has also taken to quoting the New York Times columnist Paul Krugman, a critic of austerity.His message has struck a nerve in Italy and has helped put Mr. Monti, the darling of Europe and the United States, who calmed financial speculation and put Italy back on the world stage, on the defensive on television, a medium that Mr. Berlusconi dominates the way Fred Astaire did the dance floor.Appearing on Italy’s most widely watched interview program on Monday evening, Mr. Monti, who routinely treats his predecessor with understated irony, said that Mr. Berlusconi, like a pied piper,  is entrancing  Italy but would  lead it to its death.Many analysts say that while Mr. Monti helped bring Italy back from the brink, he overestimated his popularity as a politician. Many Italians are angry that he raised the retirement age and an unpopular property tax that many say they cannot afford. (Mr. Berlusconi said he would eliminate some property taxes as a campaign promise ahead of winning the election in 2008.)As a senator for life, Mr. Monti does not need to win election, but he is essentially a candidate without a party, the figurehead of an incoherent group of centrists lacking a strong political operation.“He could be a factor of stability, but instead he quickly became another factor of instability,” Mr. Damilano said. By running to help “condition” the other parties rather than to win, he said, Mr. Monti “has already lost his political aspirations and risks becoming a third wheel,” caught between right and left.The great fear, Mr. Damilano added, is that elections could fail to produce a stable government, as happened in Greece last June before a second round of elections was held.Not to be discounted, analysts say, is the Five Star Movement of Mr. Grillo, which placed first in the Sicilian regional elections and is popular with young people fed up with Italy’s political class. It is essentially a party without a leader, since Mr. Grillo cannot be elected because he has a conviction for manslaughter in a car accident in which three people died.Mr. Berlusconi is widely seen as running to recapture voters who defected to Mr. Monti and Mr. Grillo. Analysts say his media appearances have had an important effect: They have helped put his party in first place in polls in the powerful Lombardy region, after he mended fences with a former ally, the Northern League, to back its candidate for regional president.A center-right victory in Lombardy could deprive the Democratic Party of a clear majority in the Senate, where seats are determined in part by regional showings. That means that the left could not form a government without allying with Mr. Monti’s centrists.“Monti benefits from Berlusconi’s campaign, paradoxically,” said Stefano Folli, a political commentator for Il Sole 24 Ore, a daily business newspaper.Many Italians say they have no idea how they will vote next month. Ludovico Purgatori, 20, a filmmaking student in Rome, said that Mr. Berlusconi had “lost all credibility,” but that he was not sure if Mr. Monti was “credible as a politician.” Mr. Grillo, he said, was “the most dangerous of them all. All he can do is scream and criticize.”“I’d like to see many more young politicians and fewer dinosaurs,” he added."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/world/middleeast/egypts-morsi-says-slurs-of-jews-were-taken-out-of-context.html,"CAIRO — A spokesman for President Mohamed Morsi said on Wednesday that inflammatory comments that he made about Jews before taking office had been intended as criticism of Israeli policies toward the Palestinians but had been taken out of context. The spokesman said that Mr. Morsi respected all monotheistic religions and religious freedom.It was Mr. Morsi’s first public response to news reports that as a leader of the Muslim Brotherhood he had made anti-Semitic statements about Jews and Zionists. A recently resurfaced video of a speech that Mr. Morsi gave at a rally in his hometown in the Nile Delta nearly three years ago shows him urging his listeners “to nurse our children and our grandchildren on hatred for them: for Zionists, for Jews.” In another video of a television interview he gave the same year, Mr. Morsi criticized Zionists in recognizably anti-Semitic terms, as “these bloodsuckers who attack the Palestinians, these warmongers, the descendants of apes and pigs.”Both sets of comments were reported this week in The New York Times. Representatives of the White House and the State Department condemned them. And on Wednesday Mr. Morsi was confronted about the remarks by a visiting delegation of six American senators led by John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat of Rhode Island.Yasser Ali, the Morsi spokesman, said on Wednesday night at a news conference that Mr. Morsi had told the delegation that the comments were meant as criticism of the “racist” policies of the Israeli government, not as insults to Jews.“President Morsi assured the delegation that the broadcast comments were taken out of an address against the Israeli aggression against Gaza,” Mr. Ali said, according to The Associated Press. The spokesman said Mr. Morsi also assured senators of his respect for monotheistic religions as well as for “freedom of belief and practicing religions,” The A.P. said.At a news conference after the meeting, the senators declined to characterize Mr. Morsi’s response. But they appeared to feel he had addressed the issue. The senators emphasized their support for Egypt’s transition to democracy. They also said they would press Congress to provide badly needed financial aid and urge American businesses to invest in Egypt, although they also said that Mr. Morsi’s inflammatory statements in 2010 made both requests tougher to sell.“The Egyptian people are going to have to showcase your best behavior,” said another senator in the delegation, Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/nyregion/new-york-legislators-propose-giving-illegal-immigrants-access-to-college-financial-aid.html,"Responding to more than two years of lobbying by immigrants’ advocates, the Democratic majority in the New York State Assembly threw its support on Wednesday behind a comprehensive bill that would make state financial aid available to illegal immigrants at colleges and universities.The bill would open up several state tuition-assistance programs to illegal immigrants and create a private scholarship fund to help pay for their higher education.Elements of the legislation had been proposed in piecemeal in past legislative sessions but had not become law. As a result, immigrants’ advocates stepped up their campaign for a more comprehensive and streamlined strategy, centered on a single measure with several provisions.The Democrats introduced the bill as the immigration debate shifts to the top of the national agenda.President Obama, who benefited from a record turnout of Latino voters in his re-election in November, has vowed to move quickly on an overhaul of the immigration system, including providing a path to citizenship for most of the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the country.While Democratic state lawmakers are solidly behind the new state bill, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, and Republicans in the State Senate have not said whether they would back it.The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said that just as New York this week became the first state to tighten its gun laws after the Connecticut school massacre, so too should it get out ahead in the debate over immigration policy.“This is an issue that’s on the national scene and when New York does something, everybody takes notice,” Mr. Silver said in a telephone interview. “I believe it’s important that New York puts this out so everyone can take notice.”He said the bill was justified because many of the immigrants it was intended to help were brought to the country as young children and had been raised as Americans.“They know no other country, they came as infants, they should have equal access,” he said. “It’s about fairness.”If the bill passes, New York would become the fourth state — after Texas, New Mexico and California — to offer state financial aid to illegal immigrants. Since 2002, illegal immigrants have been allowed to pay in-state tuition at state universities in New York.The bill would require that illegal immigrants satisfy certain conditions to become eligible for tuition-assistance programs, including having attended a high school in New York for at least two years and having graduated or received an equivalency certificate in the state. In addition, students would need to have lived with parents or guardians while they attended high school.The bill, called the Dream Act, borrows its name from a piece of federal legislation, stalled in Congress, that provides a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Unlike the federal bill, the state measure would not offer young immigrants a chance to gain legal status.Immigrants’ advocates urged state lawmakers to act swiftly on it.“On substance, it’s good because it puts all the ideas in one bill, and politically, it’s great because it’s clear where the leadership is,” said Chung-Wha Hong, executive director of the New York Immigration Coalition.It is not clear how the State Senate, which is controlled by a coalition of Republicans and an independent faction of Democrats, will respond to the measure.Representatives from a group of immigrant advocacy groups are scheduled to meet with a senior aide to Governor Cuomo in two weeks to discuss the bill and other legislative issues."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/world/middleeast/arab-apathy-raises-concerns-about-israeli-democracy.html,"BAKA AL-GHARBIYA, Israel — There are two distinct strains of voter apathy here in what is known as the Triangle, home to many of Israel’s 1.5 million Arab citizens.The first is familiar to citizens in many democracies. “No one deserves my vote,” was how Fayez Najmi, who sells fresh fish from a sidewalk in this town of 20,000, put it. “We don’t see any progress or any achievement. We only see the politicians during campaigns.”The second is more particular to this community. Nidal Jazmawi, who runs a dry cleaners in nearby Umm Al-Fahm and who has lived his entire life in Israel, said he was abstaining because as part of the Palestinian minority he feels his citizenship is meaningless. “This is not my country,” he said. “I don’t receive my rights in this state.”With Israel heading to the polls on Tuesday, the two intensifying sources of apathy are raising new concerns here over the health of Israeli democracy. Experts say a social media campaign to boycott the election and a growing frustration with Arab lawmakers’ focus on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, rather than local concerns like crime, poverty and unemployment, threaten to depress Arab turnout below 50 percent.That has raised alarm among Arabs and Jews concerned that a long-marginalized minority is increasingly alienated by Israel’s right-wing government and by the general tone of the campaign, particularly in the face of international criticism that its treatment of Palestinians within and beyond its borders is discriminatory and undemocratic.Several Israeli newspapers have run opinion pieces this week calling on Arabs to vote, with the liberal Haaretz newspaper taking the unusual step of printing an editorial also in Arabic. “Parliamentary elections are the heart of any civic struggle,” it read. “Despair and abstention are the worst enemies of such a struggle, and they are luxuries that Israel’s citizens cannot afford.”Ahmad Tibi, a member of Parliament since 1999, said his United Arab List had joined with its two rivals, Hadash and Balad, in Facebook campaigns and election day efforts aimed at persuading voters to go to the polls, noting that in Israel’s coalition system, staying home bolsters the largest faction, in this case Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s conservative Likud Beiteinu.“In South Africa, people were killed struggling to have one person, one vote,” Mr. Tibi said in an interview on Wednesday. “In Israel, there is discrimination in every part of life — education, infrastructure, employment. In only one thing there is equal rights: the day of the election. One person, one vote, Jews and Arabs. Those who are not participating are shooting their own legs.”While Arab-Israeli participation in national elections has been declining for decades, voters and experts alike said the situation had sharpened this year, citing as causes Israel’s political march to the right; the rising view that its conflict with the Palestinians is insoluble; an increase in laws perceived as discriminatory against Arab citizens; and the lack of unity among Arab parties.“There’s a lot of issues of trust in the system, and that drives people away from the polls.” said Guy Ben-Porat, a professor of public policy at Ben-Gurion University who studies the Arab community in Israel.Capitalizing on these concerns, a group of young activists created a boycott initiative that has gained some traction on Facebook, with an anti-voting rally scheduled for Saturday. “Voting would be a wrong way to deal with our ambitions,” said one of the organizers, George Ghantous. “Under Israel we won’t be able to get our ambitions.”There have been Arab parties in Parliament since Israel’s founding, but none have ever been part of a governing coalition (though some Palestinians elected from so-called Zionist parties have). Today, Arabs make up 20 percent of Israel’s population of nearly 8 million, and 11 of Parliament’s 120 members represent the three Arab-dominated parties — one religious, one Communist and one nationalist. A new party, Hope for Change, has joined this year’s campaign promising to focus only on domestic issues and to join the government regardless of who leads it.While more than three-quarters of Arab citizens voted in the 2008 municipal elections, turnout for national elections has been spiraling downward for decades, to 53 percent in 2009 (when 66 percent of Israeli Jews cast ballots). A November survey by As’ad Ghanem, a political scientist at the University of Haifa, found it would fall to 51 percent this time, and others predict it will plunge even lower.If Arabs voted at the same rate as Jews, they could win more than 20 seats and be the second-largest bloc in Parliament. “It’s in our hands,” said Ghaleb Majadleh, a Parliament member and former minister from the Labor Party whose headquarters is here in Baka al-Gharbiya. Increase turnout by half, he said, and “Netanyahu would not be in the government.”Israeli leaders often cite the presence of Arab citizens and their right to vote as evidence of the state’s commitment to democracy and equality. But many of the Arab lawmakers reject Israel’s self-definition as a Jewish state.Arab lawmakers and their constituents complain that their communities suffer from scarce jobs, crowded classrooms and a lack of municipal services. “You drove here: did you see the roads? Have you ever seen a city of 50,000 with no industrial zone?” Afou Eghbariyeh, a Hadash lawmaker, asked foreign journalists in Umm al Fahm. “No Ministry of Interior, no Ministry of Transportation; we have no representatives of the government here.”In Professor Ghanem’s survey, 31 percent of those who did not plan to vote said it was because they had no one to vote for, 26 percent said they were not interested in politics and 8 percent each said it was a matter of conscience or their votes did not count. A majority of nonvoters said they would cast ballots if the Arab parties united in a single list. Ibrahim Sarsur, the leader of the United Arab List, said he had tried to join with his rivals for the campaign but decided “they are not mature enough.”All three parties have blanketed towns like this one with election banners shouting their slogans: “The situation needs unity.” “We need to live in dignity.” “The whole truth.”The message is getting through to some. “The more Arabs vote, the more seats we get — this is important,” said Aseel Fadoos, 27, a carpenter who stopped at a supermarket here on Tuesday afternoon and plans to vote Balad. A young woman at a children’s clothing shop up the street said she was supporting United Arab List because “if I don’t vote, the missing voice, maybe it will go to the extremist parties.”Said Eghbariyeh, 60, who was sitting on a plastic chair outside a store in Umm Al Fahm smoking and sipping coffee, said he had always voted for Arab parties, but this time would support Meretz, a left-wing faction that pushes peace with the Palestinians. “The Arabs are only numbers, they have no influence,” he explained.Nadim Nashef, the director of Baladna, a Haifa-based youth organization, said his friends had been fiercely debating whether to vote this time, with the boycott campaign “clearly a louder and stronger voice than before.”He was torn. “Israel is using the Arab parties and the Arab citizens voting to say it’s a democracy; it’s not,” he said. “But then we need some kind of voice for our community, some people to speak out against racist rules and racist legislation, and that’s the main reason I’m voting.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/world/middleeast/netanyahu-issues-veiled-response-to-criticism-from-obama.html,"JERUSALEM — Days before an Israeli election that he is expected to win, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Wednesday directed a veiled barb at President Obama, who was quoted this week as denouncing Mr. Netanyahu’s policies.Relations between the two leaders have long been marked by tension that has erupted on occasion into open hostility, particularly over the handling of Iran’s nuclear program and Israeli settlement plans. Israeli commentators said the latest exchange of messages suggested that future relations between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu could be equally fraught.In a column published by Bloomberg View on Monday, Jeffrey Goldberg, an American journalist who is well acquainted with Israel, wrote that in the weeks after the United Nations General Assembly voted in November to upgrade the status of Palestine to that of a nonmember observer state of the United Nations, “Obama said privately and repeatedly, ‘Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are.’ With each new settlement announcement, in Obama’s view, Netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near-total isolation.”Responding to a journalist’s question about the comments and the timing during a televised visit to a military base on Wednesday, Mr. Netanyahu said, “I think everyone understands that only Israeli citizens will be the ones who determine who faithfully represents the vital interests of Israel.”Many Israelis regard Mr. Goldberg as being well connected to Mr. Obama, citing a widely publicized interview by Mr. Goldberg with the president that The Atlantic published in March. Mr. Obama said then, regarding Iran, “I think that the Israeli government recognizes that, as president of the United States, I don’t bluff,” and, “In terms of Israeli politics, there’s been a view that regardless of whether it’s a Democratic or Republican administration, the working assumption is: we’ve got Israel’s back.”Asked for a response to Mr. Goldberg’s column, Tommy Vietor, a spokesman for the National Security Council, said: “I can’t confirm that specific comment or what was allegedly discussed in private meetings. The president has been clear in stating what he believes is a realistic basis for successful negotiations, and we will continue to base our efforts on that approach.”The stinging criticism attributed to Mr. Obama made headlines in Israel, not least because of the timing. Months ago, Mr. Netanyahu was widely perceived as meddling in the American presidential campaign in favor of the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney. Now, some Israeli commentators posited, it is payback time.Others suggested that Mr. Obama’s criticism could only help Mr. Netanyahu, a conservative who is battling political parties further to his right.Tensions peaked last fall, before the American election, when Mr. Netanyahu publicly criticized the Obama administration for refusing to set clear “red lines” on Iran’s nuclear progress and said that, as a result, the administration had no “moral right” to restrain Israel from taking military action of its own.The Netanyahu government’s frequent announcements of plans to build more Jewish homes in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and the annexed East Jerusalem have been also been continual sources of friction. Washington has long viewed settlement construction as an obstacle to peace. With the Palestinians demanding a settlement freeze before returning to the negotiating table, Israeli-Palestinian talks have been stalled for years.Mr. Netanyahu blames the Palestinians for the stagnation, saying he is ready for talks without preconditions.Soon after the General Assembly voted to upgrade the status of the Palestinians, the Netanyahu government announced that it would advance plans to settle a particularly contentious area of the West Bank known as E1. Mr. Obama “didn’t even bother getting angry,” Mr. Goldberg wrote. “He told several people that this sort of behavior on Netanyahu’s part is what he has come to expect, and he suggested that he has become inured to what he sees as self-defeating policies of his Israeli counterpart.”Moshe Yaalon, Israel’s minister of strategic affairs, told Israel Radio on Wednesday that Mr. Netanyahu had led the country responsibly, and that some of his actions found favor with the United States and Europe while others did not. Asked about the timing of Mr. Goldberg’s column, so soon before Israeli elections set for Tuesday, Mr. Yaalon said that perhaps the journalist had chosen this “sensitive time” to publish it.Mr. Goldberg, a columnist for Bloomberg and a national correspondent for The Atlantic, dismissed speculation that his column had been timed to influence the Israeli election.“Think of the column as coming out after the E1 announcement rather than before the election,” Mr. Goldberg said by telephone. Arguing that American criticism of Israeli settlement building was nothing new, he added, “My column just reflects the ongoing concerns of the administration.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/opinion/who-says-you-can-kill-americans-mr-president.html,"WASHINGTONPRESIDENT OBAMA has refused to tell Congress or the American people why he believes the Constitution gives, or fails to deny, him the authority to secretly target and kill American citizens who he suspects are involved in terrorist activities overseas. So far he has killed three that we know of.Presidents had never before, to our knowledge, targeted specific Americans for military strikes. There are no court decisions that tell us if he is acting lawfully. Mr. Obama tells us not to worry, though, because his lawyers say it is fine, because experts guide the decisions and because his advisers have set up a careful process to help him decide whom he should kill.He must think we should be relieved.The three Americans known to have been killed, in two drone strikes in Yemen in the fall of 2011, are Anwar al-Awlaki, a radical Muslim cleric who was born in New Mexico; Samir Khan, a naturalized American citizen who had lived in New York and North Carolina, and was killed alongside Mr. Awlaki; and, in a strike two weeks later, Mr. Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who was born in Colorado.Most of us think these people were probably terrorists anyway. So the president’s reassurances have been enough to keep criticism at an acceptable level for the White House. Democrats in Congress and in the press have only gingerly questioned the claims by a Democratic president that he is right about the law and careful when he orders drone attacks on our citizens. And Republicans, who favor aggressive national security powers for the executive branch, look forward to the day when one of their own can wield them again.But a few of our representatives have spoken up — sort of. Several months ago, Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, began limply requesting the Department of Justice memorandums that justify the targeted killing program. At a committee hearing, Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., reminded of the request, demurred and shared a rueful chuckle with the senator. Mr. Leahy did not want to be rude, it seems — though some of us remember him being harder on former President George W. Bush’s attorney general, Alberto R. Gonzales, in 2005.So, even though Congress has the absolute power under the Constitution to receive these documents, the Democratic-controlled Senate has not fought this president to get them. If the senators did, and the president held fast to his refusal, they could go to court and demand them, and I believe they would win. Perhaps even better, they could skip getting the legal memos and go right to the meat of the matter — using oversight and perhaps legislating to control the president’s killing powers. That isn’t happening either.Thank goodness we have another branch of government to step into the fray. It is the job of the federal courts to interpret the Constitution and laws, and thus to define the boundaries of the powers of the branches of government, including their own.In reining in the branches, the courts have been toughest on themselves, however. A long line of Supreme Court cases require that judges wait for cases to come to them. They can take cases only from plaintiffs who have a personal stake in the outcome; they cannot decide political questions; they cannot rule on an issue not squarely before them.Because of these and other limitations, no case has made it far enough in federal court for a judge to rule on the merits of the basic constitutional questions at stake here. A pending case filed in July by the families of the three dead Americans does raise Fourth and Fifth Amendment challenges to the president’s killings of their relatives. We will see if the judge agrees to consider the constitutional questions or dismisses the case, citing limitations on his own power.In another case, decided two weeks ago, a federal judge in Manhattan, Colleen McMahon, ruled, grudgingly, that the American Civil Liberties Union and two New York Times reporters could not get access, under the Freedom of Information Act, to classified legal memorandums that were relied on to justify the targeted killing program. In her opinion, she expressed serious reservations about the president’s interpretation of the constitutional questions. But the merits of the program were not before her, just access to the Justice Department memos, so her opinion was, in effect, nothing but an interesting read.So at the moment, the legislature and the courts are flummoxed by, or don’t care about, how or whether to take on this aggressive program. But Mr. Obama, a former constitutional law professor, should know, of all people, what needs to be done. He was highly critical when Mr. Bush applied new constitutional theories to justify warrantless wiretapping and “enhanced interrogation.” In his 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama demanded transparency, and after taking office, he released legal memos that the Bush administration had kept secret. Once the self-serving constitutional analysis that the Bush team had used was revealed, legal scholars from across the spectrum studied and denounced it.While Mr. Obama has criticized his predecessor, he has also worried about his successors. Last fall, when the election’s outcome was still in doubt, Mr. Obama talked about drone strikes in general and said Congress and the courts should in some manner “rein in” presidents by putting a “legal architecture in place.” His comments seemed to reflect concern that future presidents should perhaps not wield alone such awesome and unchecked power over life and death — of anyone, not just Americans. Oddly, under current law, Congress and the courts are involved when presidents eavesdrop on Americans, detain them or harshly interrogate them — but not when they kill them.It is not just the most recent president, this one and the next whom we need to worry about when it comes to improper exercise of power. It is every president. Mr. Obama should declassify and release, to Congress, the press and the public, documents that set forth the detailed constitutional and statutory analysis he relies on for targeting and killing American citizens.Perhaps Mr. Obama still believes that, in a democracy, the people have a right to know the legal theories upon which the president executes his great powers. Certainly, we can hope so. After all, his interpretation might be wrong."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/nyregion/few-cuomo-campaign-donors-give-less-than-1000.html,"ALBANY — Middle-class contributors are getting squeezed out of New York’s political process.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo has condemned the influence of money in politics and promised reform. But his own campaign is a case study in how irrelevant small donors have become in New York. Over the last two years, only 1 percent of the money raised by Mr. Cuomo's campaign came from donors who gave him less than $1,000, according to an analysis by the New York Public Interest Research Group, while seven donors gave him $100,000 to $500,000.Only about 5 percent of donations to the governor came from donors who gave less than $2,500.The pattern is hardly unique to the governor’s campaign, though his numbers are perhaps the most striking, as he has built a $22.5 million war chest, according to new campaign finance disclosures made this week. New York has the highest contribution limits in the nation — $60,800 for statewide candidates — though there are a dozen states without any limits at all. The donation limit for federal campaigns is $2,500.But even the high contribution limits in New York are easily evaded. The name of the governor’s largest donor, the real estate developer Leonard Litwin, does not appear in new campaign finance records, because he takes advantage of what has long been seen as a loophole in state laws — using limited-liability companies to legally circumvent the contribution limits. Mr. Litwin has donated $500,000 to the governor over the past two years.Mr. Cuomo’s campaign is hardly the only case in point. The largest individual political donor in recent years has been Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He recently flexed his political muscle by giving $250,000 to State Assembly Democrats; such large donations are permitted to campaign committees. He has already given millions of dollars to State Senate Republicans.“No better case can be made for campaign finance reform that includes public funding than the results these candidates are posting,” said Dick Dadey, executive director of Citizens Union, one of the main groups supporting tighter state laws.Larry Norden, a lawyer at the Brennan Center for Justice, a research and advocacy group, said, “It’s troubling to see such a small slice of the population essentially running and paying for our elections.”“We have these ridiculously high contribution limits,” he added, “but on top of that, they don’t even mean anything, because you can go way past them with L.L.C.’s.”The governor has not yet drafted legislation, but in his State of the State address last week he said he would propose lower contribution limits, more enforcement of violations and a public financing system similar to the one used by New York City, which matches small donations several fold in exchange for candidates’ agreeing to spending limits.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, has also said he will propose what he called “the nation’s most aggressive disclosure law, period,” including disclosure of all political contributions within 48 hours.“For government to be effective, we must be trusted,” the governor said. “We must enact campaign finance reform, because people believe that campaigns are financed by someone else at exorbitant rates.”In a statement on Wednesday, Allison Gollust, the governor’s communications director, said: “The governor is not campaigning at this time, so he hasn’t done many fund-raising events, which would include low-donor events. He will do the low-donor events when the campaigning cycle is under way.”Previous efforts at campaign finance reform have often failed. The Cuomo administration promised major changes to disclosure rules applied to secretive 501(c)4 organizations like the Committee to Save New York, which has backed his agenda, but the state ethics board ended up drafting a rule that allows such groups to release inaccurate numbers.Senate Republicans have also been resistant to sweeping efforts to change campaign finance laws, and Senator Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, the Republican leader, had a cool response to the governor’s proposals last week, raising concerns about the cost of a system like New York City’s.“The Senate has supported reforms in the past to increase transparency and accountability,” he said, but added, “I do not support using taxpayer dollars to fund political campaigns.”The Senate does have a different dynamic this year, with a breakaway faction of Democrats joining Republicans in leading it. Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx, the leader of the independent Democrats, has been generally supportive of campaign finance reform, though it is not clear how his views will factor into negotiations, when they take place.Eric Soufer, a spokesman for the independent Democrats, said “Senator Klein has long supported comprehensive campaign finance reform and looks forward to discussing the governor’s proposals with his Senate colleagues.”Mr. Norden said, “Really it’s going to come down to the Senate.” He added, “In the past, we’ve seen resistance by Senate Republicans in particular, and the pressure will be on them.”"

Kirkuk is about 180 miles north of Baghdad.Tensions have increased recently in the city, where government soldiers squared off with Kurdish militias after Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki sought to consolidate his control over security there.“This is a political explosion,” said Muhammed Kamal, the chief of the Kurdistan Democratic Party in Kirkuk. “Iraq is witnessing a political crisis that is being reflected on the security of the country and it’s all because of the prime minister.”The attacks took place on Atlas Street, one of the busiest thoroughfares in central Kirkuk. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but car bombs have frequently been used by Sunni insurgents.The bombings came a day after a member of the Iraqi Parliament was killed in a suicide bomb attack in Anbar Province. The lawmaker, Efan al-Essawi, was also the leader of a local council of the Awakening movement, an American-backed group of Sunni militias that switched sides to fight Al Qaeda in Iraq.Mr. Essawi had escaped earlier assassination attempts. In 2009, attackers placed a magnetic bomb on the armored car he was using when he was a candidate for Parliament, the first attack on a candidate as those elections approached.Also on Wednesday, gunmen killed three policemen at a checkpoint northeast of the capital, according to the police, and two women were killed in an attack west of Baghdad."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/business/lawmakers-seek-data-on-energy-drinks.html,"Three Democratic lawmakers sent letters to 14 marketers of highly caffeinated energy drinks on Thursday requesting information about the products’ ingredients and any company studies showing their risks and benefits to children and young people.In recent months, the Food and Drug Administration has begun examining the safety of energy drinks after reports of deaths and injuries potentially associated with the products. The number of annual emergency room visits involving the drinks doubled from 2007 to 2011, according to a federal report released last week.In addition, claims by drink producers that their proprietary formulations give consumers a physical and mental edge are coming under scrutiny. There is little scientific evidence, researchers say, that the drinks provide anything more than a high dose of caffeine similar to that in a cup of strong coffee.The letters were sent by Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts to companies including Monster Beverage, Rockstar, Red Bull and Living Essentials, the distributor of 5-Hour Energy, a small, concentrated energy “shot” drink. Letters were also sent to PepsiCo, which sells Amp; Coca-Cola, which sells NOS; and Dr Pepper Snapple, which sells Venom Energy.Among other questions in the letters, the lawmakers asked the companies to specify the total amount of caffeine in their energy drinks. Products like 5-Hour Energy that are marketed as supplements do not list the amount of caffeine used, and producers take it from a variety of sources, including synthetic caffeine, the guarana plant and tea extracts.They asked why each company chose to market its energy product as a beverage or a dietary supplement. The two categories have separate rules about ingredient disclosures and reporting of potential health risks.The lawmakers also requested any studies that the marketers have run or underwritten that examine the effects of energy drink use on children or young adults.The few studies cited by energy drink companies to support their marketing claims have taken place among adults and have compared the effects of energy drinks with those of a placebo like flavored water.Other public officials, including the attorney general of New York State and the city attorney of San Francisco, are looking into drink makers’ marketing claims."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/nyregion/thompson-says-he-wouldnt-raise-taxes-as-mayor.html,"Differentiating himself from his likely Democratic rivals in the mayoral race, William C. Thompson Jr. vowed on Thursday that he would not raise taxes if elected.Mr. Thompson, a former New York City comptroller, made his pledge after delivering a speech to a civic group in which he proposed to increase the number of police officers to 37,000 from the current level of 35,000, and to make the boroughs outside of Manhattan bigger hubs for back-office jobs. To pay for his ideas, he told the audience, he would look for a “better bang for the buck” in government “without increasing taxes.”Asked by reporters later whether he was offering a “read my lips” pledge for the city, Mr. Thompson said yes — and repeated it five times over five minutes.“Let me just be blunt, so there’s no misunderstanding: I’m not raising taxes,” said Mr. Thompson, who lost to Michael R. Bloomberg in the 2009 mayoral election.Mr. Thompson’s position contrasts with that of two other likely mayoral contenders, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and John C. Liu, the comptroller, who have proposed to raise taxes on the wealthiest New Yorkers. The other major presumptive Democratic candidate, Speaker Christine C. Quinn of the City Council, said through a campaign spokesman on Thursday that “raising taxes should always be a last resort” but that it would be “irresponsible to take anything off the table.”The forum for Mr. Thompson’s speech — a breakfast organized by the Association for a Better New York — has become a popular choice for civic leaders seeking to unveil big ideas. It was before the same group that Mr. de Blasio in October proposed that taxes be raised to help pay for prekindergarten and after-school programs.Asked Thursday about Mr. de Blasio’s proposal, Mr. Thompson, a former president of the city’s Board of Education, said that “the issue with pre-k isn’t necessarily just about dollars; it’s about space.”“Just to tax — to be able to increase the amount of money that you may not be able to use — doesn’t make sense,” he continued.Instead, he said he favored “redirecting dollars” and “making sure we prioritize every dollar to make sure we get the best bang for each buck.”In his prepared remarks, Mr. Thompson listed four core challenges facing the city: keeping crime low, preventing a fiscal crisis, investing in infrastructure spending after Hurricane Sandy and narrowing an “affordability gap” for working-class families.He said that as mayor, he would appoint a deputy mayor for infrastructure. He pledged to appoint an educator as schools chancellor, repeating a promise he made at a mayoral forum on Tuesday in Harlem. And he took a jab at Ms. Quinn, who is the best-known mayoral contender and has strong favorability ratings, citing the “1-2 punch of fiscal irresponsibility that is Mayor Bloomberg and Speaker Quinn.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/politics/florida-governor-backs-changes-in-election-law.html,"MIAMI — Two months after Florida was denounced for its chaotic election process, Gov. Rick Scott on Thursday endorsed three major changes proposed by the state’s election supervisors.Governor Scott said he would support increasing the number of early voting days, including adding back the Sunday before Election Day, widening the range of polling places and reducing the length of ballots.In 2011, the Republican-controlled Legislature changed Florida’s election law by shortening the number of early voting days and hours and tightening other election rules, including voter registration. Mr. Scott, a Republican, signed the bill, despite criticism from Democrats and voter and civil rights groups who said Republicans simply wanted to reduce the number of Democrats voting.Election supervisors warned at the time that truncated early voting would lead to long lines and pose other hurdles. They were proved right. Voters in some counties and precincts waited in maddening lines, both during early voting and on Election Day. Some voters in Miami-Dade County cast their ballots after the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, had conceded the race.Recently the governor has distanced himself from the 2011 election law. He told the state’s legislative black caucus this week that the election law was not his and that he had nothing to do with passing the bill.On Thursday, in a statement endorsing the proposal, Mr. Scott said the “ultimate goal must be to restore Floridians’ confidence in our election system.”“I want to ensure we do whatever possible to improve our election system from the statewide level,” he said.The proposal calls for extending early voting once again to a maximum of 14 days from 8, including adding back the Sunday before Election Day, a popular day among black voters; increasing voting hours to 168 hours from 96; allowing votes to be cast at locations beyond election offices, city halls and libraries; and making sure that ballots are kept short.Any change in the law must be approved by the Legislature, which convenes for its one-month session in March.Mr. Scott’s endorsement comes on the same day as the release of a new report concluding that black and Latino voters were most affected by the 2011 changes.Of the more than 1.17 million ballots cast by black voters, nearly half were during early voting.“They bore disproportionately the long lines that we all witnessed,” said Daniel A. Smith, a University of Florida political science professor who was co-author of the report.Over all, the report found that compared with 2008, there were 225,000 fewer ballots cast during early voting and an increase of nearly 500,000 absentee ballots, in part because of fears about long waits.Absentee ballots cast by blacks were twice as likely to be rejected as those by whites. Racial and ethnic minorities also cast a disproportionate number of provisional ballots and saw them rejected at higher rates.The League of Women Voters, which was one of several groups to sue the state over the law, praised Mr. Scott’s announcement Thursday, saying it was a step in the right direction.But Howard Simon, the director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida, said the proposals were too narrow to reverse the “flaws” in the process.“Many of the embarrassments that we saw in the November election would not have happened without Governor Scott’s signature and his administration spending taxpayer dollars to defend the Legislature’s voter suppression tactics,” Mr. Simon said. “So while it is heartening to see that the governor is willing to start a discussion about addressing flaws in our state’s election system, that conversation can’t stop here.”"

These pioneers of the second Roman Empire are the vanguard of thousands more who are being hand-picked throughout Italy for the burden of empire. The chief qualifications are good physique, the Fascist spirit and a good reputation as workers. They must be between twenty-five and forty years of age, and many of them are veterans of the war. Brindisi was beflagged and a large crowd turned out in their honor today. These particular colonists have been gathered from Apulia, the heel of Italy. Their wives and families will follow later when the rough work of building shelters and preparing the land has been accomplished. 1963 Budget Hits $98.8 BillionWASHINGTON — President Kennedy today sent Congress a record-smashing $98.8 billion spending budget for fiscal 1964, the year that will begin next July 1. The Chief Executive called for spending $4.5 billion more than the peacetime high of $94.3 billion that the government is paying out this year and $500 million more than it disbursed during fiscal 1945, the peak spending year of World War II. Mr. Kennedy said his program will boost the Federal budget deficit to $11.9 billion from $8.8 billion this year. He predicted that tax receipts will climb to a new peak of $86.9 billion from a record volume of $85.5 billion during the current 12 months. Secretary of the Treasury Douglas Dillon told a news conference that it “could be” that the government will continue to post budget deficits for the next three years and that the next surplus will not come before fiscal 1967. There have been only six budget surpluses since 1930."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/politics/in-texas-legislative-session-a-subdued-start.html,"Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.Some legislative sessions start with grand plans, reforming this body of law, planting the seeds of that program, marking the culmination of a big political uprising. But the start of this session has been marked by constraint, with two of the three principal actors in the political repair shop.There’s a shortage of the “vision thing” former President George H. W. Bush used to talk about.No. 1: Gov. Rick Perry has been in three expensive political races in the last three years. He won the first two — a 2010 Republican primary in the governor’s race against Kay Bailey Hutchison, then a United States senator, and the ensuing general election. In the third, Mr. Perry showed he wasn’t ready for the presidency.Whatever else you might say about those contests, they were not cheap. The governor has been back to his sponsors several times, and they might be realizing theirs is an expensive habit when he passes the plate for potential future runs for governor and even president.And Mr. Perry is not the only alternative for those conservatives, who have a replacement in the garage. Attorney General Greg Abbott would like to run, has widespread support inside the Republican Party, and has reported that he has $18 million in his campaign account. That’s enough to run a contested Republican primary campaign in 2014 even if he doesn’t raise another penny.Mr. Perry, by comparison, reached the end of 2012 with just over $6 million on hand. He has always been able to raise money and has plenty of time to do so if he runs again. But it is interesting that an incumbent leader of a state party holds only a third as much money as his possible successor and challenger.The governor’s policy initiatives are also anemic. The only measures that can be considered during the first 60 days of a legislative session are those that have been declared “emergencies” by the governor, but he has been telling lawmakers he might not declare any this year. Last session, Mr. Perry had a handful of hot-button bills he wanted to spotlight.And look at No. 2: Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst hoped to be in Ms. Hutchison’s chair in Washington but lost to Ted Cruz in a runoff for last year’s election. As Mr. Dewhurst was coming to terms with that, he found out that a longtime associate had been accused of pilfering his campaign accounts — a financial fiasco now in the hands of accountants, lawyers and prosecutors and serving as a major distraction right when the Legislature is starting its busy season.No. 3 might have the grandest plans: Joe Straus, the third-term House speaker, was the first to focus on big stuff this time, saying that this session ought to be about water, transportation, jobs and education in a way that elevated those subjects and devalued some of the noisier, shinier stuff so distracting to politicians and headline writers.All three are on board, sort of. After the first of the Wednesday breakfasts that Mr. Perry, Mr. Dewhurst and Mr. Straus have during the legislative session, they talked about roads, water and education. Two days earlier, the Texas comptroller had predicted an upturn in the state’s financial prospects, catching some of the number crunchers in the Capitol off guard and giving others — Mr. Perry, for instance — an opportunity to sweep some coins off the table for tax relief.While some want to restore budget cuts made two years ago, or hope to put some money into the water, transportation and education infrastructure they’ve talked about, Mr. Perry is considering cuts in business taxes and increases in the size of homestead exemptions from property taxes. Mr. Dewhurst wants a water plan, but it looks like it will be written in the House. Those are important matters, but they aren’t exactly commanding the public’s attention and admiration.George P. Bush, the first member of his famous family’s fourth generation to make a political splash in Texas, pointed out a few days ago that the current crop of statewide officeholders is aging out. He was polite about it, but he noted their actual ages and their time in office when he was talking about his own entry into politics: “Republican or Democrat, I think it’s time for folks in my generation to step up and get involved in public service,” he said.Maybe they’ll have some big ideas."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/world/middleeast/israeli-candidates-make-their-cases-on-tv.html,"HERZLIYA, Israel — On the set here this week of Israel’s most popular political television satire show, a character impersonating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood by a large map of the region as he drew a system of fences, spiked barriers and security doors around Israel’s borders. He then slapped a sign over the country that read, “Do Not Disturb.”The skit, typical fare for “Eretz Nehederet” (“A Wonderful Country”), was a humorous retort during this election season, when Israelis are hit with a concentrated burst of political television. Under the rules of Israel’s idiosyncratic system, the 34 parties running in the election are barred from buying television time, but are entitled to seven minutes of free airtime on each of the three main television channels.They also get an extra two minutes for every seat the party holds in the Knesset, or Parliament. For the prime minister’s ticket, this means an hour and a half of free airtime in the two weeks before the Jan. 22 ballot.“Our enemies are big — and brown,” said the caricatured prime minister as he pointed on the map to the shaded area representing Iran, spoofing the kind of campaigns many here consider ill suited to addressing the urgent issues facing the next government.In his own commercials, the prime minister boasts of achievements — like completing a fence along the border with Egypt, and bringing down cellphone costs. As Israel’s election campaign heads into its final leg, the nightly blocks of state-financed party broadcasts are aimed largely at the fifth or quarter of the electorate that pollsters say remains undecided. A mainstay of Israeli campaigns since television arrived here in the 1960s, the commercials have ranged from the fright-inducing (Mr. Netanyahu’s footage of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran) to the bizarre (an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who pledges bread for a shekel, or 27 cents).On the first night, the broadcasts went on for 75 minutes, though they more typically run for about half an hour.Yet in a campaign devoid of American-style televised debates, Israelis are increasingly questioning whether the television broadcasts — which are the core of the campaigns — still have any relevance.“Like a scorching interrogation in the dungeons of the Securitate, I was also ready to confess to anything,” wrote Itay Segel, a television critic for the popular newspaper Yediot Aharonot, after the first night. “The election propaganda, as always, convinces the convinced and bores the bored.”Candidates also use social media, go on widely publicized pub crawls, visit markets and attend parlor meetings and discussion panels. But very often — and with greater impact — they find themselves the subject of sarcasm, appearing as puppets or in the form of actors impersonating them on satire shows.In a country where the satirists say it is hard to compete with the political reality, more than twice the percentage of households in Israel watch “Eretz Nehederet,” produced for Channel 2 by the Keshet media group, than tune in to the official election broadcasts.“There is no doubt that the entertainment shows have more influence than the broadcasts,” said Yuval Karniel, an expert in communications at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. “The broadcasts are redundant; there is nothing like them in the Western world.”Embodying the quirkiness of the system, a dour-looking man in his mid-50s, Ofer Lifshitz, has been appearing on television each night to drum up support for his party, the Everlasting Covenant for the Salvation of Israel.His message: “Nine years ago the Holy One Blessed Be He sent me to save the people of Israel who have been enslaved and persecuted by Israeli governments for generations.”Mr. Lifshitz’s little-known party is unlikely to gain enough votes to pass the electoral threshold. Previous incarnations of the Everlasting Covenant, which used to advocate for a separation of state and religion and now calls for a constitution based on the Torah, did not. Still, Mr. Lifshitz, along with the Pirates Party and the Green Leaf-Liberal List, is allocated the same airtime as Yesh Atid (There is a Future), a recently formed centrist party led by a former television host, Yair Lapid, that is widely predicted to become a coalition partner in the next government.The campaign broadcasts are a throwback to the days when Israel had only one, state-owned television channel. To ensure fairness, politicians were banned from the screen for two months before an election other than in the regulated blocks of campaign commercials.Watching them was a ritual in the days when viewers had nowhere else to go, and in the 1970s and ’80s, they had ratings of up to 90 percent. But public interest has waned greatly. Over the past week, an average of about 16 percent of households tuned in.Other than giving exposure to small and new parties and possibly influencing a few wavering voters, the impact of the television campaign is minimal, experts say. “It doesn’t influence the public or media agenda at all,” said Gabriel Weimann, a professor at the University of Haifa who has studied the issue. “But only the Knesset can abolish it, and since it gives the politicians free access to our television sets, why give it up?”The two main commercial channels are now obligated to run the campaign broadcasts free of charge. In a small concession to modernity, the Knesset’s Central Elections Committee has cut the television campaign period from three weeks to two and no longer forces the channels to show the broadcasts at prime time.Likud-Beiteinu’s videos have focused on Mr. Netanyahu the statesman, addressing the world from the halls of the United Nations and Congress, and standing by a map in his office pledging to cover all of Israel with the Iron Dome anti-rocket missile system, to fence Israel in on all its borders and to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The panoramic shots of Jerusalem always manage to omit the landmark Muslim shrines.Shelly Yacimovich, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, tried to soften her image in her election broadcasts with a scene from her kitchen, where she showed off a freezer stocked with plastic containers of homemade chicken soup. Ms. Yacimovich has been criticized by some traditional Labor supporters for focusing solely on socioeconomic issues and not taking a stand, for example, against settlement construction in the West Bank.On the set in Herzliya, her “Eretz Nehederet” counterpart, Helly, an abrasive, overbearing character, threw whole, unpeeled vegetables into a pot as she expounded on the best way to freeze schnitzels as opposed to freezing settlements.The new star of this season of “Eretz Nehederet” is Naftali Bennett, the leader of the rightist Jewish Home Party, which has been climbing in the polls. He appears as a computer-generated wild, messianic settler who is made to look like an appealing guy-next-door, but whose intrinsic extremism keeps slipping out.Apparently gratified at having made it onto the show, the real Mr. Bennett posted a picture of his slightly crazed “Eretz Nehederet” character on his Facebook page.“As citizens we often cry while writing our comedy,” said Muli Segev, the chief producer of “Eretz Nehederet.” “The reality is very depressing. Campaigns here are always about everything but what is going to happen.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/senator-john-whitmire-walks-a-fine-line-on-conflicts.html,"A clamor for ethics reform was sweeping the state and the nation in 1973 when John Whitmire, a 23-year-old college dropout, was sworn in as a freshman member of the Texas House.Watergate was on its way to becoming a household word, and in Texas an influence-peddling controversy known as the Sharpstown scandal had thrust public corruption into the spotlight. In response, lawmakers for the first time agreed to disclose how they make their money.Mr. Whitmire said he does not remember why he voted to weaken that disclosure proposal. What he does recall is how naïve he was.“Back then, you didn’t have campaign war chests,” Mr. Whitmire, Democrat of Houston, said in a recent interview in his Capitol office. “You’ve got to understand, I had nothing. I didn’t even know what a lobbyist was when I got elected. I probably couldn’t hardly even spell it.” He later finished college and became a lawyer.Mr. Whitmire, 63, has learned a thing or two in his four decades as a legislator. When he is not making laws, he is working in the government affairs section of a politically connected law firm — the section that employs registered lobbyists. Without ever leaving the Legislature, he has been a federal lobbyist.“I know how to spell it now,” he said, deadpan.He knows how to raise and spend campaign money, too.As he begins his 21st regular legislative session, Mr. Whitmire boasts the Legislature’s biggest war chest — more than $6 million at last count, eclipsing what Gov. Rick Perry reported this week.Like many of his peers, Mr. Whitmire at times has used some of the money to help finance an often-lavish lifestyle. He uses it to pay for part of a lease of an $80,000 BMW 650i, and since the 1990s has bought $290,000 in tickets to sports events, including the Houston rodeo. Car leases are allowable and the ticket purchases, for “constituent entertainment,” got the Texas Ethics Commission’s blessing.At the Capitol, Mr. Whitmire is the dean of the Senate — where he took office in 1983 — the title reserved for its longest-serving member. His old friends call him something else: “Boogie,” a nickname that evokes his party boy reputation but actually stems from the zip-up “boogie boots” he used to wear.He can be both charming and intimidating, a bully to some, a lovable scoundrel to others. Mr. Whitmire has been hailed for his ambitious work in overhauling the criminal justice system, but over the years his personal business dealings have demonstrated just how blurry the lines can get between a lawmaker’s public duties and private interests.He has been known to represent — on legal retainer or as a consultant — government contractors, taxpayer-supported agencies and close friends who do business with public entities. For the past 15 years, Mr. Whitmire has also been “of counsel” to the Houston-based legal giant Locke Lord, which has a long list of clients with interests before the Legislature, including some that have benefited from legislation he has sponsored or helped pass.Mr. Whitmire does not have to disclose his pay or clients at the firm. Both he and Locke Lord say he adheres to a code of conduct that ensures zero conflicts with his official duties. “I just have very strict rules, between me and the practice,” Mr. Whitmire said. “They don’t lobby me, I don’t contact them. I couldn’t give you a list of their clients if my life depended on it.”That has not stopped critics from questioning whether the legislator who got his start in a reform-minded Legislature has come to embody the very conflicts of interest it struggled to avoid — or at least to fully reveal to the public.“This is a guy who is in bed with so many people I don’t know if he has his constituents’ best interest in mind or his own pocketbook’s best interest in mind,” said Trent Seibert, the founder of Texas Watchdog, a nonprofit group dedicated to tracking the influence of money in state politics. “This is what turns people off from politics.”John Harris Whitmire was born in Hillsboro, Tex., in 1949. His father was the Hill County clerk and his mother was a nurse.He remembers failing the first grade, part of a difficult childhood he says he got through with hard work and perseverance. He left college in 1972 to run for the House, but went back to get his degree and also attended law school, gaining admittance to the bar without finishing, thanks to a special dispensation for legislators.Mr. Whitmire’s decade in the House was uneventful. In 1973, Texas Monthly labeled him “furniture,” and in 1979 he earned a spot on the magazine’s list of the worst legislators. It called him “Double Zero,” one digit for his ability, the other for his stature.In those days, he had barely two nickels to his name. His first personal financial statement in 1974 showed no stocks or property, and the only job he reported was as a part-time legislator, which paid $400 a month.Fast forward to his 2012 disclosure statement, and a far different picture emerges. Mr. Whitmire lists property worth up to $6 million. He has also invested with Houston developers who have been involved in questionable public sector deals. Texas’ weak disclosure rules make it impossible to know how lucrative they were.He says he has an investment in condominium projects being developed by Mike Surface, a Houston developer and friend. Mr. Surface was at the center of a corruption scandal that brought down the Harris County commissioner Jerry Eversole in 2011. This is at least the second time Mr. Whitmire has partnered with the developer. He says he cannot remember the first investment. His 1998 disclosure statement says only that it was sold for a net gain of “more than $25,000.”In a plea deal that forbids Mr. Surface from entering into government real estate deals for five years, the developer admitted he provided gifts to Mr. Eversole, including more than $60,000 in cash, with the intent to influence him. Mr. Surface was sentenced to two years of probation. Mr. Whitmire said he was interviewed by the F.B.I. about the government’s wide-ranging corruption investigation in Harris County. But he said he was not the target of any investigation.“I was told specifically I was not being investigated. I was a resource,” Mr. Whitmire said, his voice rising. “Did you hear what I just said? I was specifically told.”It was not the first time Mr. Whitmire’s dealings with developers were in the news. In the early ’90s, he introduced executives of BSL Golf Corporation to the Houston Municipal Employees Pension Fund. The fund’s investments in BSL later sparked city and F.B.I. investigations, according to reports in Houston newspapers and KPRC-TV. The owners, Andrew Schatte and Richard Bischoff, later denied there had been an F.B.I. investigation.Last month, Mr. Bischoff told The Texas Tribune that for years Mr. Whitmire was paid a retainer from BSL Golf’s parent company, Universal Services. Mr. Bischoff said that he saw no conflict of interest in the payments and that they stopped around 2000.Mr. Whitmire attributes criticism of his private dealings to political opponents bent on tarnishing his reputation.Though he was lauded in the mid-1990s for his criminal justice legislation, Mr. Whitmire’s life outside the legislative arena made breathless headlines.In 1993, a few weeks after passing a bill benefiting the Houston Firefighters’ Relief and Retirement Fund, Mr. Whitmire signed a contract to lobby for the pension board in Washington.Two years later, he was investigated for flouting Senate hiring rules. He also came under fire from watchdogs for taking legal fees from a foundation that ran a halfway house whose state financing he had helped oversee. Mr. Whitmire tightened internal spending controls in his Senate office and ended his contract with the foundation. A contract with the Harris County probation department, which hired Mr. Whitmire to help explain the penal code overhaul he passed, was canceled after questions were raised.Mr. Whitmire said the Harris County district attorney’s office concluded the issue involved a rule barring lawmakers from getting two state paychecks but found no criminal violation.“Would I do that today? No, of course I wouldn’t do that today,” Mr. Whitmire said. “I have a better sense of what my job is.”Mr. Whitmire, who paid nearly $200,000 to defense lawyers in the 1990s, was never formally accused of any wrongdoing. The negative news coverage has subsided considerably. But the questions have continued.Mr. Whitmire’s employer, Locke Lord, represents four public pension funds, including the one that hired him to lobby in 1993. Both the Houston police and the firefighters’ funds hired the firm before Mr. Whitmire started working there in 1997.Since 1996, he has also been on the Pension Review Board, which oversees all public pension funds in Texas. Mr. Whitmire says his years of advocacy for public pension funds at the Capitol have nothing to do with his paid work.At home, Mr. Whitmire’s blended approach to politics and lawmaking can still be found in his district office. The landlord of the two-story building is Lawrence Kagan, a friend and donor.Mr. Whitmire says the office has been a bargain for the state, which for nearly 20 years has paid rent to Mr. Kagan’s company, adding up to an estimated $500,000 or more, based on state expenditure data and published monthly rent figures. Mr. Whitmire separately rents — for $200 a month — a small part of the building from Mr. Kagan as his campaign office.Mr. Whitmire said he could not remember if he had ever done any legal work for Mr. Kagan, but he urged the state’s health and human services agency to keep leasing a large office building from Mr. Kagan, also calling it a good deal. The agency has paid Mr. Kagan about $10 million since 2004. Mr. Kagan did not return calls for this article.Mr. Whitmire could be Mr. Kagan’s most reliable long-term tenant. At a ceremony on Monday celebrating the legislator’s 40th anniversary in office, one fellow senator said he would not be surprised if the dean serves for another 40 years.That would be fine with Mr. Whitmire.“I’m a public servant,” he said. “It is a religion to me. It is my purpose in life. I get up in the morning, I stress out about people’s conditions. And I will continue to do it as long as I can breathe.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/politics/recalling-pain-of-guns-toll-mayors-urge-bills-passage.html,"WASHINGTON — Some mayors spoke about the bad feeling they got with each call that there had been another shooting in their city. Others described the pain of burying police officers who had worked for them. Many recalled their attempts to console grieving families.So as mayors from around the nation gathered here on Thursday for the 81st winter meeting of the United States Conference of Mayors, many said they were heartened by President Obama’s call for new laws to curb gun violence, which included several measures that the conference had sought for decades. Many said they planned to urge Congress to enact them.“Far too often it is the mayor who gets the call about a tragic crime committed with an illegal gun that’s resulted in a loss of life,” Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia, the president of the conference, said in a speech. “It may be the life of a child. A police officer. A young black man. A young woman. It could be anyone in our cities. But it’s the mayor who visits the family members who have had their hearts torn out, and the mayor who attends funeral after funeral after funeral.”Mayor Ron Littlefield of Chattanooga, Tenn., recalled a police officer who was shot to death while responding to a robbery at a pawnshop. Mayor Sly James of Kansas City, Mo., lamented what he called the “slow-motion mass murder” that claims the lives of more than 100 young people in his city each year. And Mayor R. T. Rybak of Minneapolis said he had “heard too many eulogies for amazing people whom I will never know.”The mayors gave a standing ovation to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who praised the work they had done over the years on gun issues and urged them to push for the passage of the president’s proposals.“There are some who say the most powerful voice in this debate belongs to the gun lobby and those who demand a stop to these common-sense approaches to save lives,” Mr. Biden told the Conference of Mayors. “I think they’re wrong.”“Newtown has shocked the nation,” the vice president said. “The carnage on our streets is no longer able to be ignored. We’re going to take this fight to the halls of Congress. We’re going to take it beyond that. We’re going to take it to the American people.”Many mayors said they were eager at the prospect that new gun laws might pass.Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. of Charleston, S.C., who has been in office for more than three decades, said he hoped that the country would “seize this moment.”“I know that no police officer wants to be confronted with an assault weapon,” he said. “They would be out-ammoed. And I think that it’s time for our country to deal with this, it’s time for Congress to deal with this.”But even here, at a meeting of a group that has advocated stricter gun laws for decades, there was not unanimity. Mayor Mick Cornett of Oklahoma City, a Republican, said he did not believe that the gun control proposals being discussed would “resolve the problem they’re trying to resolve.”“There are larger issues out there, and more specific issues, and I really would like to see us get a better handle on mental health,” he said. “I think the way that has trended in the last 10 years, the way that filters out into our jails and types of violence like this needs to be addressed. I wish they’d concentrate on that.”One thing the mayors who are seeking new gun laws seem to lack is a high-profile sitting Republican mayor who agrees with them — the way, say, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani became an influential voice in the debate in the early 1990s when he expressed his support for an assault weapons ban. (Mr. Giuliani reiterated his support for such a ban in an interview this month on NY1, the New York cable news channel.)But some Republican mayors from smaller cities support tighter gun laws. Mayor Richard Ward of Hurst, Tex., a Republican, came here to lobby Congress with Mayors Against Illegal Guns, an advocacy group led by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York and Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston.Mr. Ward, a gun owner who said he enjoyed “blasting away” at targets, said that after he joined the group, he got more than 100 letters from constituents who belonged to the National Rifle Association urging him to leave it.“The next election I got 90 percent of the vote,” he said, chuckling. “After that I got 86 percent — they’re gaining on me!”Mr. Rybak, the Minneapolis mayor, suggested that his counterparts, who buy thousands of guns to arm their police departments, should use their clout with the gun industry.“We buy a boatload of guns in this country,” he said Wednesday at a news conference called by Mayors Against Illegal Guns. “If the gun lobby comes here to Congress and starts throwing their weight around about what’s going to happen with guns, well, the mayors of America are going to stand up: we buy a lot more guns than almost anybody in this country.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/world/asia/gen-yang-baibing-dies-at-93-led-tiananmen-crackdown.html,"BEIJING — Gen. Yang Baibing, a military strongman who carried out the violent suppression of student-led protests in Tiananmen Square in 1989 and was later purged because of fears that he was accruing too much power, died here on Tuesday. He was 93.His death was reported by the official Xinhua news agency. A statement issued by the party’s Central Committee provided the sort of terse homage typically reserved for a disgraced political figure, saying, “He was a seasoned loyal Communist fighter and a proletarian revolutionist.”The younger half brother of Yang Shangkun, a former president of China and a Red Army luminary, General Yang had largely been forgotten in the two decades since the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, stripped the brothers of their posts out of concern that they were seeking to upend his succession plan with what some analysts described as a “minicoup.” Their downfall was probably abetted by Deng’s handpicked successor, Jiang Zemin, as he moved to isolate potential rivals in his drive to consolidate power.But during the politically turbulent years after the Tiananmen crackdown, General Yang was a prominent defender of the economic reforms being championed by Deng, who was facing resistance from conservatives. In a statement published by a party newspaper, General Yang declared the military to be the “protector and escort” of reform, which included efforts to open China to the outside world.In the end, Deng’s economic liberalization drive prevailed, paving the way for China’s extraordinary economic growth.The alliance with Deng, however, proved short-lived. Rumors surfaced that General Yang had privately raised the prospect of a succession plan without the likes of Mr. Jiang, who at the time was displaying lukewarm support for market-oriented reforms. In late 1992, after Deng caught wind of the talk — some called it a plot — the Yang brothers lost their posts, as did scores of their loyalists in the military.Among democracy advocates, General Yang is best remembered for carrying out Deng’s order to clear unarmed demonstrators occupying Tiananmen Square in Beijing in the spring of 1989. In May, his older brother appeared on television with Li Peng, the prime minister at the time, to justify the imposition of martial law to quell demonstrations that had paralyzed the heart of the capital. As general secretary of the Central Military Commission and the army’s political commissar, General Yang mobilized troops whose gunfire would claim hundreds if not thousands of lives.In the months that followed, the Yang brothers — sometimes referred to disparagingly as the “Yang family clique” — purged officers who had failed to carry out their orders properly. But in his ensuing drive to pack the army’s upper ranks with allies, General Yang incurred the resentment of military elders, who accused the brothers of trying to subvert Deng’s succession plans.Deng, in failing health, moved against the brothers, with some reluctance, only after learning that General Yang had held an unauthorized meeting with military officers at a Beijing hotel in which they discussed an alternative leadership arrangement that would go into effect upon Deng’s death, according to Ming Pao, a newspaper in Hong Kong. At a party congress several weeks later, General Yang was ousted from his military post, although he was given a nominal spot on the 20-seat Politburo until Mr. Jiang reportedly nudged him off in 1997.Deng died that year at 92.As is the case with many top Chinese leaders, not much is known about General Yang’s private life. Raised in southwest Sichuan Province, he was the 11th child of an “open-minded and patriotic landowner,” according to China Daily, and joined the Communist Party in 1938. He was imprisoned for much of the decade-long Cultural Revolution and later rehabilitated, becoming a full general in 1988.Yang Shangkun, his brother and the former president, died in 1998.It is unclear what General Yang did after his forced retirement, although two years ago he made a rare public appearance in Chongqing, his eyes shaded by sunglasses, during the unveiling of a memorial to another brother, Yang An’gong, who was killed by warlords during a Communist-led uprising in 1927.In recent years General Yang was said to have sought a publisher for his memoirs, which included a justification for the use of force against the Tiananmen Square demonstrators. Bao Pu, a publisher in Hong Kong, said party leaders had rejected the manuscript, presumably because it broached a subject that remains taboo here.Mr. Bao, whose father was purged as Communist Party secretary general for opposing the use of force in Tiananmen Square, said many historians were eager to know whether in his memoirs General Yang had expressed regret for the killings.“Thanks to the Yang brothers, China’s only military victory of the last 30 years involved cracking down on its own people,” Mr. Bao said. “You can’t help but wonder if he had any reflection on that.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/politics/obamas-campaign-machinery-turns-to-promoting-policy.html,"WASHINGTON — A new political operation created to advance President Obama’s agenda in his second term will be allowed to raise unlimited money and accept corporate contributions, but officials said Friday the donations will be disclosed.Obama for America, the organization that mobilized the president’s army of supporters during his two races for the White House, now has a new name: Organizing for Action. The aim of the group, which will be overseen by a small inner circle of former campaign advisers, will be to promote Mr. Obama’s policies and to give Democratic activists and other allies a way to rally behind his agenda.The group’s chairman will be Jim Messina, the president’s campaign manager in 2012. He said Friday that the grass-roots effort would start by tackling gun control, immigration and climate change and would operate under the same financing rules as the president’s inauguration committee, which accepts corporate contributions.“We’re disclosing all donors,” Mr. Messina said in an interview. “The president feels strongly about transparency.”The group, which also will be advised by David Plouffe and other top political aides to Mr. Obama, reflects the evolution in the president’s view on the intersection of money and politics. A year ago, facing the prospect of a financial disadvantage against Republicans in his re-election bid, Mr. Obama reversed himself and gave his blessing to a “super PAC” supporting his campaign.Organizing for Action, which will be tax-exempt, can draw upon unlimited donations to take advantage of a muscular campaign apparatus that includes millions of Obama supporters. The group is planning to run television advertisements in a campaign-style effort to push the president’s initiatives.“It’s not focused on politics,” Mr. Messina said. “It’s on supporting the legislative agenda.”In previous administrations, similar tasks would have been performed by the White House Office of Political Affairs or the Democratic National Committee. But an outside group allows the operation to raise money, broadcast television ads and essentially run a political campaign on issues without running afoul of government guidelines that prohibit directly advocating for legislation.Organizing for Action will be set up under Section 501(c)(4) of the tax code, the federal designation for “social welfare” groups that are dedicated to advancing broad community interests. The government does not require the disclosure of donors, although Mr. Messina said the group would voluntarily disclose its sources of financing but not impose contribution limits. Aides said they were uncertain whether the amount of specific donations would be revealed.“We have a remarkable opportunity right now to change our country,” Mr. Messina said in a message to supporters on Friday. “And if we can take the enthusiasm and passion that people showed throughout the campaign and channel it into the work ahead of us, we will be unstoppable.”The leadership of the group will include Robert Gibbs, the president’s longtime confidant and former White House press secretary, as well as Stephanie Cutter, Jennifer O’Malley Dillon and Julianna Smoot, three deputy campaign managers. Jon Carson, who left the White House this week after serving in the Office of Community Engagement, will be the group’s executive director.The president and the first lady, Michelle Obama, expressed their support for the group on Friday and asked their backers to stay active in the second term.“We should all be proud of what we accomplished, but let’s be clear: all that hard work was about more than just one election,” Mrs. Obama said in a video to supporters. “We can’t stop now.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/world/asia/kachin-refugees-reported-to-flee-myanmar-to-china.html,"BANGKOK — After weeks of intense fighting near the border with China, the Myanmar government on Friday announced what appeared to be a unilateral cease-fire in its offensive against ethnic Kachin rebels. The government also said it would pursue peace talks, but it was unclear how the rebels would react to the government’s overtures.The announcement of a cease-fire, to start Saturday, was made during the main evening newscast and came only hours after Parliament approved a resolution calling for an end to a year and a half of fighting. Myanmar’s actions have come under increased scrutiny by an international community fearful that the country, an emerging democracy, will backslide.China, an ally worried about an influx of refugees, as well as the shells that have landed on its side of the border, had also been vocal and called for a cease-fire, according to Xinhua, China’s state news agency.Many questions remain about the cease-fire, including whether the military — which has been gaining territory almost daily — will comply with the order. Myanmar, also known as Burma, was ruled by a military junta until 2011 and is still transitioning to more democratic rule, with the roles of its leaders still evolving. President Thein Sein — who is not the commander in chief under the country’s new Constitution — had suggested several times that the army was not supposed to go on the offensive but was to act only in defense, though it has been unclear how strongly he was pushing the army to stop fighting.Friday’s announcement was much more detailed, including a precise time (by 6 a.m. Saturday) when the cease-fire was supposed to go into effect.One leading Kachin voice, the Rev. Samson Hkalam, the general secretary of the Kachin Baptist Convention, said by telephone that he was skeptical of the announcement.“According to our experience, the declarations by the government are one thing,” he said. “What the army does is another.”He also said the cease-fire was limited. “There are many areas that Myanmar troops occupy,” he said. “The cease-fire applies to only one area.”According to the government announcement, the cease-fire applies to the area around the town of Lajayang, the site of the major fighting. It is not known what that means for the rest of Kachin State, where the rebels control pockets of territory.The statement said the military had “concluded its conditional mission” in the Lajayang offensive and had secured the “safety of troops.” It said there had been more than a thousand “battles” between the rebels and government troops since Dec. 10. The government also said the military had suffered many casualties, but did not give a number. A military officer, however, said 218 troops had been killed and 764 wounded since Nov. 15, according to an official tally. The officer requested anonymity because he was not authorized to release the information.The cease-fire announcement came as the commander in chief of Myanmar’s armed forces, Vice Senior-General Min Aung Hlaing, is on an official visit to Singapore and Malaysia.The Myanmar military has intensified its campaign against the Kachin rebels since the end of December, and witnesses have described frequent shelling in and around the town of Laiza, the rebel base.The central government’s relationship with its many minorities is considered a crucial gauge — for those inside and outside the country — of the reforms that Mr. Thein Sein has been carrying out since coming to power in March 2011 and that have helped lead to a suspension of sanctions by the United States and other countries.The hostilities with the Kachin have already increased tensions among other ethnic groups, a point underlined by a statement issued by the leaders of the Wa, a group that has a cease-fire agreement with the government but still has thousands of men under arms.The statement, which was co-signed by two other groups, warned of a return to civil war in Myanmar. “The country will return backward” if the fighting does not stop, the statement said.The debates leading up to the cease-fire have been notable for the relative absence of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, the opposition leader and Nobel laureate, who was quoted this week as saying that she would not take a major role in trying to end the fighting because it was not the purview of her parliamentary committee.Instead, the speaker of the lower house of Parliament, Thura Shwe Mann, a former general, commanded the spotlight. He rushed the motion for an immediate halt to hostilities in Kachin State to a vote — without discussion — because he said the issue was “vital for the country,” according to Burmese news reports. The strong call was notable because it appeared to reflect the growing influence of Parliament — an institution that did not exist under military rule.Before the Myanmar government’s announcement, official Chinese news organizations reported that Burmese refugees fleeing the fighting had entered southwestern China, where many were living with relatives and friends.The reports, which appeared this week, said the number of those arriving in China was growing, but did not give estimates. An article published online by People’s Daily, controlled by the Communist Party, said some hotels near the border between Yunnan Province and Kachin State were fully booked.The Myanmar Army has been pressing a campaign against the rebel Kachin Independence Army since June 2011, when a 17-year cease-fire collapsed. The rebels controlled a large area in Kachin State and protected it as an autonomous region. The fighting has disrupted Chinese hydroelectric projects in the region and jade mining, an important part of the border trade in Yunnan.Thousands of Kachin, who are mostly Christian, crossed into Yunnan after the breakdown of the 2011 cease-fire, and many took shelter in refugee camps. Chinese Christians provided aid, as did ethnic Kachin living in China, who are called Jingpo in Mandarin. Last August, officials in Yunnan forced most of the refugees to leave the camps and return to the war zone, drawing criticism from Human Rights Watch and other groups."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/politics/ryan-returns-to-spotlight-at-republican-retreat.html,"WILLIAMSBURG, Va. — When House Republicans arrived from the nation’s capital in the colonial capital this week, they were greeted by a brigade in traditional garb. Men in tricornered hats twittered away (on the fife), and three founding fathers — Thomas Jefferson, Patrick Henry and George Washington — stopped by to give speeches.Over two and a half days that ended Friday, Republicans holed up at the stately Kingsmill Resort for their annual retreat tried to game out the year. The resort bills itself as a “golf, spa and luxury hotel,” but few of the members had much time for pleasure; as the majority in the House staring down a Democratic-led Senate and Democratic White House, there was work to be done. Even Speaker John A. Boehner, an obsessive golfer, was unable to slip away for a round. (The chilly damp weather, with a light dusting of snow Thursday evening, didn’t help).Though the news media were not allowed to attend the official retreat, and were sequestered in a restaurant clubhouse on the property (more on that later), here’s a look at what went on:And He’s BackWhen Representative Paul D. Ryan’s vice-presidential bid ended in November, he returned to Congress but receded into the background, giving few interviews and, save for a high-profile vote in favor of the “fiscal cliff” deal, keeping his head down. But for those wondering about Mr. Ryan’s next act, the answer came into relief Thursday, when he addressed journalists as something of the official spokesman for his conference.“We think the worst thing for the economy, for this Congress and this administration would be to do nothing to get our debt and deficits under control,” Mr. Ryan said. “We know we have a debt crisis coming. This is not an ‘if’ question, it’s a ‘when’ question.”There had been some suggestion that Mr. Ryan might be considering a presidential bid in 2016 and despite his perch as Budget Committee chairman, was going to pull a rope-a-dope, allowing the House leadership to shoulder the responsibility on coming fiscal fights. But he took a front-and-center role at the retreat, both in public and behind the scenes.Mr. Ryan was one of only two legislators officially trotted out before the gathered reporters to speak on the record, and he was the one who gave his fellow members a dose of bitter medicine, warning, “We also have to recognize the realities of the divided government that we have.”He was also the first to publicly mention that his conference was open to the idea of a short-term extension of the debt limit, which ultimately became the biggest news out of the retreat.If Williamsburg marked the premiere of the 113th Congressional House Republicans, Mr. Ryan apparently intends to take a starring role.Debt Limit, Debt LimitThe Republican retreat is meant to be an opportunity for members to discuss the coming year. But the most important strategic decision, it seemed, involved only the first 90 days.So what does the first quarter of 2013 hold? A possible short-term extension of the debt ceiling, which emerged as a proposal on which nearly the entire conference was able to come to rare consensus. But other than the fiscal wrangling to come, Republicans still trying to get their bearings after the November elections did not seem to delve too deeply into the other big issues they are certain to confront.When Representative John C. Fleming of Louisiana wandered over to the clubhouse to chat with reporters Thursday afternoon, he said that gun control and immigration — two of three major issues on the White House’s plate — had not even come up.Another participant later clarified that gun control had been discussed, albeit briefly. The verdict: “In terms of legislation, the Senate will almost certainly act first,” the official said.Full CryThough House Republicans have struggled to marshal the majority of their majority on two big-ticket votes, the bare 218 required to pass legislation is no longer sufficient to satisfy Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the majority whip.He wants the “full cry.”The term “whip,” Mr. McCarthy explained, derives from a fox hunting expression. A “full cry,” he added, is the call made when the dog catches the scent of the fox.When a “full cry” comes, all of the other dogs — in the case of this metaphor, presumably, the House Republicans — fall into line, pursuing the prey with unified vigor. And this “full cry” is exactly what Mr. McCarthy hopes for from his whip team and conference.On the first night of the retreat, he even presented members of his whip team with sleek new black jackets — with the “full cry” slogan emblazoned on the sleeve in white letters.To the StocksWhile the House Republicans were treated to colonial festivities (and breakout session after breakout session), the news media were banished to the stocks, confined to a single room in the clubhouse. When several reporters tried to go to an adjoining room to sit by the fire, they were promptly scolded and told they could leave only to eat or use the bathroom.Meanwhile, a lectern — with five American flags — had been set up for the possibility of televised news conferences, but on Friday morning, the official word came: There would be no briefings, the House leadership would not be holding a news conference after all. At that point, the assembled reporters began beating a retreat of their own — back to the nation’s capital for the presidential inauguration."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/us/c-ray-nagin-former-mayor-of-new-orleans-indicted-on-corruption-charges.html,"NEW ORLEANS — C. Ray Nagin, the former mayor of this city who fulminated against the federal government’s response to Hurricane Katrina but became for many a symbol of the shortcomings of government himself, was indicted by a federal grand jury on Friday on 21 counts including conspiracy, bribery and money laundering.The indictment detailed a wide-ranging scheme of kickbacks and pay-for-play of a kind not entirely unfamiliar in Louisiana history. Contractors and vendors looking for work with the city would provide the mayor with vacations, big checks and even free granite for his family business. In exchange, they would be awarded lucrative contracts with the city, assistance in defusing community opposition to their projects and even forgiveness of tax penalties.While federal prosecutors have convicted a Louisiana governor, a congressman, a city councilman and members of the school board in the past 15 years alone, this is the first time in New Orleans history that a mayor has been indicted on corruption charges.Mr. Nagin’s lawyer, Robert Jenkins, did not return a call seeking comment. However, he called a local radio talk show in the afternoon, and in response to a question from the host, John McConnell, known as Spud, suggested that the indictment had come as a surprise amid continuing plea negotiations.“Well, we were surprised that the indictment came today because we were still talking with the government and in fact we had talked about meeting next week as well,” he said.But it came as no surprise here in the city, where people had been expecting an indictment for months. Aside from someone identified only as “Businessman A,” the other figures accused of taking part in the conspiracy have either been convicted or pleaded guilty to bribery and corruption charges in the past three years.Even the timing was not a shock, as one of the contractors pleaded guilty in December to paying a $60,000 bribe to “Public Official A” on Jan. 30, 2008, which set off a five-year statute of limitations that would have come to a close this month.While Mr. Nagin, 56, had not been officially named as a target of a federal grand jury, the pretense that Public Official A, who showed up in another plea, could be anyone but the mayor had long since been abandoned on local news reports and in conversations around town.A lawyer for one of the contractors suggested to reporters last month that a person would have to be “the worst investigative reporter on the planet” to not know who Public Official A was.“This has long been a topic of conversation among the political class,” said Edward E. Chervenak, a professor of political science at the University of New Orleans. “When are the feds going to indict Nagin? Everybody’s been waiting for the shoe to fall.”Mr. Nagin came into office in 2002 as an outsider, a reformer out to clean City Hall, a business executive who disdained the old machine politics and was spouting new ideas. It did not take long for him to develop a reputation as a man whose thoughts far outpaced his actions, with ambitious proposals often going nowhere.“It was really a signature problem in his early administration,” said Stephanie Grace, a former columnist for The Times-Picayune who covered his entire career as mayor. “It wasn’t corruption. It was just things just not happening.”While the inability to act was an unfortunate if tolerable trait in a mayor during normal times, it took on tragic dimensions after Hurricane Katrina, when the very existence of the city was in doubt. New Orleanians scattered around the country looked to the mayor for direction on how the city would rebuild and, while Mr. Nagin frequently offered colorful commentary on the frustrations of recovery, he gave little guidance even on crucial issues.“He basically made this decision not to decide,” Ms. Grace said.Still, though billions of dollars in federal money were coming into New Orleans after Katrina, few initially thought of the mayor as corrupt.Not until a series of investigative reports in The Times-Picayune and, in 2010, the guilty plea of Mr. Nagin’s chief technology officer, did that conception start changing. According to the indictment, F.B.I. agents had interviewed Mr. Nagin about kickbacks as far back as 2009.The indictment alleges that the mayor began a kickback scheme in June 2004, with an executive order allowing Greg Meffert, the technology officer, to engage a city vendor in a no-bid contract.The government also asserted that Mr. Nagin received kickbacks from the vendor, a man named Mark St. Pierre, who was convicted in the spring of 2011 on 53 corruption-related charges. Mr. Meffert pleaded guilty in 2010 to taking more than $800,000 in bribes.The kickbacks from Mr. St. Pierre as well as other contractors included trips on private jets to New York, Chicago, Jamaica and Las Vegas, free cellphone service, campaign contributions and payments of tens of thousands of dollars, some in the form of checks or cash and others in monthly wire transfers, the government alleges. The payments from one contractor continued for months after Mr. Nagin left office, in May 2010.In return, those paying bribes received multimillion-dollar contracts for reconstruction projects, as well as smaller property management projects in neighborhoods all over a still-struggling city.Much of the bribery, the government alleges, involved Stone Age, a granite countertop business run by Mr. Nagin and his two sons, Jeremy and Jarin. Company accounts would be used to disguise the payoffs, and some of the payoffs came in the form of several shipments of free granite, or coveted business arrangements with local branches of a “major retail corporation,” reported to be Home Depot.Two family members of Mr. Nagin’s are mentioned in the indictment as having received bribes, though no one else has been charged. The penalties are hefty: if convicted, Mr. Nagin could face 20 years on each of the nine wire fraud counts alone. His arraignment is scheduled for Jan. 31.Mr. Nagin’s indictment also underscores the impatience with corruption and bad governance that set in after the storm, the levee failures and the large-scale mismanagement that followed. Crooked contractors and inept officials at all levels were hardly rare here, but a citizenry that may have shrugged them off the past has shown far less tolerance since 2005.The current mayor, Mitch Landrieu, who lost to Mr. Nagin in 2006 only to win election in 2010 in part because of widespread voter remorse, issued a statement calling Friday “a sad day for the city of New Orleans.”“Public corruption cannot and will not be tolerated,” he added.On Friday morning, Mr. Nagin, who has been living in Texas and who was known internationally during the trying months of fall 2005 for always having something to say about anything, reposted on his Twitter feed a message from someone else, the televangelist Joel Osteen.“You are closest to your victory,” it read, “when you face the greatest opposition.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/nyregion/cecilia-tkaczyk-democrat-ekes-out-win-in-republican-senate-district.html,"Hoping to pad their narrow majority in the State Senate, Republicans used the redistricting process last year to draw a new, Republican-friendly district in the Albany area.They expected that George A. Amedore Jr., a state assemblyman whose family has a successful home-building business in the capital region, would have no trouble making the jump to the Legislature’s upper house. Democrats sued to block the creation of the seat, but failed.Yet on Friday, 73 days after Election Day, Mr. Amedore conceded defeat to a little-known opponent: Cecilia F. Tkaczyk, a Democrat who, in addition to serving as vice president of the local school board, is also the vice president of the Golden Fleece Spinners and Weavers Guild.Ms. Tkaczyk (pronounced KAT-chik) was ahead by 18 votes — out of more than 126,000 cast — after a batch of contested ballots was counted in Ulster and Albany Counties. (Another uncounted ballot was found in Montgomery County, but it remains unclear whether it will be counted.)“No one believed our campaign had a chance in a district hand-carved by Republicans,” she said, “and yet the power of good ideas and a strong campaign proved itself.”Ms. Tkaczyk, from Schenectady County, is a third-generation farmer, and among her hobbies is spinning wool from her flock of Jacob sheep. She, unlike Mr. Amedore, also favors putting in place a system of public financing for state elections; supporters of election reform, including Jonathan Soros, a son of the billionaire financier George Soros, poured money into an independent-expenditure campaign supporting her.“She ran a great race and was a great candidate,” Jonathan Soros said. “Voters want this reform, and they’re actually willing to vote on it.”The race was for a seahorse-shaped district that stretches from the Mohawk Valley to the Hudson Valley. Ms. Tkaczyk, by trade a housing policy expert, emerged from Election Day with a narrow lead, but Mr. Amedore overtook her during a court-supervised counting of paper ballots, and a judge declared him the winner in late December.But an appeals court ruled last week that 99 additional disputed ballots should be tallied, and on Wednesday, the state’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, declined to hear an appeal, allowing the ballot-counting to proceed.“It was especially gratifying for the school board member and farmer to defeat the exceedingly wealthy assemblyman for whom the district was tailor-made,” said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, which backed Ms. Tkaczyk. “David beat Goliath on this one, and that’s always a satisfying feeling for everyone involved.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/world/africa/zimbabwe-groups-protest-crackdown.html,"Representatives of 58 civic organizations, including religious, legal and human rights groups, on Friday condemned what they called an escalating campaign against critics of President Robert Mugabe’s party ahead of elections expected this year. The groups said there was a “well-calculated and intensified” assault on human rights activists, journalists and artists using such methods as slander, intimidation, raids, arrests and legal prosecutions. Mr. Mugabe’s party, ZANU-PF, has often been accused of cracking down on the opposition during election campaigns. In Geneva, the United Nations also condemned what it described as a crackdown against civil society groups. On Thursday, Mr. Mugabe and Prime Minister Morgan Tsvangirai said they had resolved disputes over a proposed new constitution and would soon call a referendum on it, a crucial step before elections."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/opinion/how-obama-can-learn-from-failure.html,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C.PRESIDENT OBAMA has often invited, even encouraged, comparison to predecessors like Abraham Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan who left lasting legacies. He has carefully studied what made those great presidents great. But he can also learn from presidents known primarily for their failures.Consider, for example, James Monroe — the only person, besides Mr. Obama, to be the third president in a row to be re-elected. His first term, which began in 1817, was known as the Era of Good Feelings because it coincided with the demise of any viable opposition party. When he was re-elected in 1820, he won every electoral vote but one. Yet most Americans know nothing about his presidency except perhaps the Monroe Doctrine, which pledged American intervention to protect the Americas from European interference.Once wildly popular, Monroe is now barely remembered. First, his legislative achievements eroded over time. He signed two of the most important laws of the 19th century: the Missouri Compromise, which admitted Missouri as a slave state and Maine as a free state, and the Tenure of Office Act of 1820, which restricted the terms of certain officials in the executive branch. But subsequent presidents tried to repeal or amend the laws, and the Supreme Court eventually declared both unconstitutional.Second, Monroe had no distinctive constitutional vision. The last member of a “Virginia dynasty,” starting with Washington, Jefferson and Madison, he lacked their vision or stature. Even without opposition, Monroe was unsure where to lead the country. His last two years in office were so fractious that they became known as “the era of bad feelings.” His collapse was extraordinary in its speed.Third, Monroe, unlike his predecessor, Madison, had no natural heir. Subsequent presidents, including his successor, John Quincy Adams, who had been his secretary of state, felt little fidelity to his legacy.If Mr. Obama wants to avoid Monroe’s mistakes, he must extend the narrative of his presidency with a view to posterity. He should consider whom he wants to follow him and which of his legislative initiatives Republicans might support. If Mr. Obama doesn’t get involved in the next election or cannot produce significant bipartisan achievements, he risks having his successors belittle or bury his legacy.Grover Cleveland, who also served two terms (though they were not consecutive), is even more forgotten than Monroe. He was the only Democrat elected in the late 19th century and the only president other than Roosevelt to have won a plurality of the popular vote in three consecutive presidential elections. (Benjamin Harrison won the Electoral College in 1888, despite having received fewer votes.)Cleveland is forgotten because he blocked rather than built. He devoted his first term, 1885 to 1889, to vetoing laws that he thought favored special interests. He eventually cast more vetoes than any president except Franklin Roosevelt. In his second term, from 1893 to 1897, the Senate retaliated against his efforts to replace executive officials by stalling hundreds of his nominations. Cleveland successfully appealed to the public to break the impasse with the Senate, but his contempt for Congress took its toll.In his second term, his disdain for Congress, bullying and stubbornness prevented him from any meaningful action to relieve the depression that followed the Panic of 1893. Mr. Obama, whose relations with Congress, even members of his own party, have often been distant, should take heed.Unlike Cleveland, Calvin Coolidge had the vision and rhetoric required for an enduring legacy, but he, too, failed the test of time. Virtually unknown when he became vice president to Warren G. Harding, Coolidge inherited a scandal-ridden administration when Harding died in 1923. He worked with Congress to root out corruption, established regular press briefings and handily won the 1924 election. Over the next four years, he signed the most significant federal disaster relief bill until Hurricane Katrina and the first federal regulation of broadcasting and aviation. He helped enact the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which famously (and unsuccessfully) tried to outlaw war.Coolidge’s vision had wide appeal. His conviction that the business of America is business still resonates among many Republicans, but he squandered his good will with the Republican-led Senate when, shortly after his inauguration in 1925, he insisted on renominating Charles Warren as attorney general after the Senate had rejected his nomination. Coolidge could have easily been elected to a second full term, but he lost interest in politics after his son died in 1924. He did not help his secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, win the presidency in 1928 and said nothing as the economy lapsed into the Great Depression. He was widely ridiculed for his penchant for silence. The eventual recognition of the failures of his international initiatives and laissez-faire economic policies destroyed his legacy.A final president whose failures are instructive to Mr. Obama is Jimmy Carter. He is best praised for what he has done since leaving office, but Americans have forgotten that he actually accomplished almost everything he wanted legislatively, including landmark laws on the environment and government ethics. Carter’s failure to communicate a positive vision of his presidency was arguably even more significant in his defeat in the 1980 election than the Iran hostage crisis and the high inflation of the late 1970s.Being re-elected does not ensure Mr. Obama a permanent legacy. His challenge is to frame an inspiring vision that ties together the formidable achievements of his first term — the health care overhaul, the auto industry rescue, reform of financial regulations, withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan and the killing of Osama bin Laden —  with goals, still not strongly articulated, for his second. He has to tell a story of his presidency that he wants Americans to remember and not allow others, particularly his detractors, to frame the narrative.In this deeply partisan era, Mr. Obama won’t be able to stand above the fray like Monroe and Coolidge, but he shouldn’t become mired in it, like Cleveland and Carter. He must work with Congress rather than becoming embroiled in battles with it.On several issues, including gay rights and the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama has appeared detached from the political process —   following rather than leading. He has only a few years to build on the real achievements of his first term and be remembered as something more than having been the first black president. By examining the failures of predecessors like Monroe, Cleveland, Coolidge and Carter, he can avoid suffering a similar disheartening fate."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/education/california-university-president-to-quit.html,"Citing health reasons, the president of the University of California, Mark Yudof, said Friday that he would step down at the end of August. Mr. Yudof, who has overseen the 10-college system for five years, said he would teach law at the University of California, Berkeley. Mr. Yudof said that the series of budget cuts the system had faced seemed to be ending. “We are not fully in the clear, but we are much closer than we were even a few months ago,” he said. In the state budget proposed last week, the system received $250 million more than last year."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/women-are-a-majority-on-gov-rick-perrys-staff.html,"When Gov. Rick Perry looks up from his desk these days, more often than not he is surrounded by women.For the first time in his tenure, his chief of staff and deputy chief of staff are women. So are his director of communications, his press secretary, his heads of scheduling and administration and his human resources director, along with the bulk of his appointments staff.In all, about 60 percent of the 256 governor’s office employees are women. Among Mr. Perry’s most senior staff — those charged with making key decisions for the governor — two-thirds are women.“Rick Perry has never needed a binder full of women,” said Deirdre Delisi, who was Mr. Perry’s first female chief of staff, alluding to Mitt Romney’s comments, during a presidential debate, about how he sought help recruiting women for cabinet posts while he was the governor of Massachusetts.The governor’s opponents suggest that his tenure has not been kind to women in Texas. Mr. Perry, the state’s longest-serving governor, has worked to further restrict access to abortion. And he has been unwavering in his desire to force all Planned Parenthood clinics — which may not provide abortions if they accept state or federal tax dollars — out of a program that provides family planning services to the state’s poorest women.But no one can argue about his hiring practices, especially in light of a recent controversy about President Obama’s inner circle being dominated by men.In an interview, Mr. Perry said “no one should be shocked” by the number of women in his administration. “I live every day with four strong women,” he said, referring to his wife, Anita, his daughter, Sydney, and his two dogs, Rory and Lucy.And it just so happens, Mr. Perry added, that this particular staff lineup “is probably the most experienced, capable and knowledgeable group of people working around me since I started.”But he confessed that the gender makeup of his office, while meaningful, is hardly intentional.“I looked up one day and thought, ‘That’s kind of interesting,’ ” he said, then turned to the lone male staff member in the room and joked, “Where are all the guys?”Ms. Delisi, a political consultant who became chairwoman of the state’s Transportation Commission at Mr. Perry’s urging after leaving the governor’s office, said that although the number of women in leadership roles in his administration has reached a new high, it is not novel.Mr. Perry “surrounded himself with strong, capable women at the Agriculture Department, in the lieutenant governor’s office and when he became governor,” she said. Being his first female chief of staff, she added, “didn’t feel like breaking new ground.”Ann S. Bishop, the former executive director of the Employees Retirement System whom the governor named his chief of staff in November, is accustomed to women stocking the executive offices of state agencies. She, for one, has been a deputy comptroller and was the inaugural head of the state’s Department of Information Resources. Still, Ms. Bishop said, she was “pleasantly surprised” to walk into her first staff meeting at the governor’s office and see how many of her colleagues were women.“The governor surrounds himself with the brightest and best,” she said, “and women are obviously part of that mix.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/politics/washington-readies-for-festive-but-scaled-down-version-of-inauguration.html,"WASHINGTON — Tens of thousands of visitors — most, but not all, happy Democrats — streamed into a dressed-up capital city this weekend as organizers prepared for an inauguration that, while not as grand as four years ago, is still cause for celebration among supporters of President Obama.Barbara and Loren Ing drove their minivan here from rural Ohio, lugging a trailer filled with glass centerpieces. As a volunteer for the society representing her native state, Illinois, Mrs. Ing — who ordinarily works in the layaway department of her local Kmart — spent months creating the table décor for the society’s inaugural ball, one of countless unofficial parties marking Mr. Obama’s second swearing-in.At the historic Willard Hotel — where the four-night inaugural rate for elegant “Oval Suites” is $22,800, with a $27,000 catering minimum — women in mink coats and pearls milled about the lobby. The bartender mixed “Blue Hawaiians” in honor of Mr. Obama’s birthplace. In the kitchen, the pastry chef spent last week baking delicate French macarons in red, white and blue.By Saturday afternoon, out-of-towners clutching maps strolled past the White House in the bright sunshine, as street vendors hawked inaugural trinkets. Parade reviewing stands were decked with patriotic bunting, Pennsylvania Avenue was lined with flags, and across town at the Washington Convention Center, workers were busy erecting lighting and stages for Mr. Obama’s two official inaugural balls.Tens of thousands of ticket holders will cram into the 2.3-million-square-foot convention center Monday night to hear Smokey Robinson, Stevie Wonder, Alicia Keys and the cast of TV’s “Glee” — all while hoping for a glimpse of Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, twirling around the dance floor.“It’s clearly not as big or as plentiful or elaborate as the last time, but in many ways for Democrats it’s even sweeter,” said Hilary Rosen, a prominent Obama supporter. “People are thrilled about the president; there are a record number of women in the Senate. Gay people are happy, and Latinos. You have these pillars of the election; it meant something different to everybody, but it culminated in this collectively powerful feeling.”For Donna Hardy, a federal employee from Oakland, Calif., who walked in front of the White House on Saturday clutching a newly purchased “Obama” hat, the second swearing-in is more historic than the first.“An African American being elected back to back?” she asked. “I don’t think we’ll ever see that again.”Officials expect 600,000 to 800,000 people to turn out on the National Mall for Monday’s ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol — a crowd typical for inaugurations but far short of the 1.8 million who clogged the city in 2009, creating pedestrian gridlock that kept many from getting to their seats.This year, the Congressional committee overseeing the ceremony arranged for extra cellphone towers on the Mall, and devised a mobile phone app with a GPS system to help inaugural-goers navigate the city, said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York and the committee chairman.Mr. Schumer spent Saturday at the Capitol, overseeing preparations as tables were set in Statuary Hall for Monday’s inaugural luncheon. He will make opening remarks and introduce the participants; he said the thought that “so many people who have been waiting with anticipation for months won’t be able to get their seats” was one of two fears that had kept him awake at night. The other is that he will miss his cue to introduce the chief justice.“I’m practicing my speech, but I’m less worried about that and more worried about when I’m supposed to get up and say, ‘Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. John Roberts Jr., the chief justice of the Supreme Court,’ ” he said. “I’m worried I won’t get up in time.”Mr. Obama will take his official oath on Sunday just before noon in the Blue Room of the White House; the Constitution states that presidential terms expire at noon on Jan. 20. Monday’s festivities, which coincide with Martin Luther King’s Birthday, are ceremonial. (Mr. Obama will use one of Dr. King’s Bibles, along with one that belonged to Abraham Lincoln, when he retakes the oath on Monday.)To honor Dr. King, Mr. Obama designated Saturday a national day of service. He, Mrs. Obama and their daughters, Malia and Sasha, spent part of the afternoon helping to refurbish a school in Northeast Washington, with hundreds of other volunteers organized by the City Year nonprofit group. Mr. and Mrs. Obama stained a bookshelf.While much of Washington is gearing up for a party, some Republicans are lying low — or getting out of town.“My wife had a partial knee replacement, so I am staying with her in Mississippi,” Trent Lott, the former senator from that state, wrote in an e-mail. “Most Republicans will be otherwise busy. Some will attend events and parties, because it does only happen every four years.”But Democrats are in the mood to celebrate. Emily’s List, which helps elect Democratic women who favor abortion rights, was planning a party for 1,400 to welcome female Congressional newcomers. “We’re celebrating our shattering of glass ceilings everywhere,” said Jen Bluestein, the group’s communications director.The Futuro Fund, which mobilized Hispanic voters in support of Mr. Obama, staged a symposium on Latino issues on Saturday as part of a three-day “Latino Inaugural.” It planned a celebration at the Kennedy Center on Sunday night, headlined by Eva Longoria, José Feliciano, Chita Rivera, Rita Moreno and other Hispanic entertainers.Although Bruce Springsteen — a staple of Obama campaign events — will not return to Washington for this year’s inauguration, James Taylor will perform “America the Beautiful,” Kelly Clarkson will sing “My Country ’Tis of Thee,” and Beyoncé will close the ceremony with the national anthem.In 2009, hotels were sold out months in advance; marketing representatives said rooms were finally booking up last week, in part because celebrities and their entourages were making last-minute decisions to come.“The amount of celebrities, the wattage, may be a little dimmer,” said Barbara Martin, whose business, BrandLinkDC, represents luxury clients, including the W Hotel on the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route. “Like, I don’t think Beyoncé is party-hopping. That being said, I feel that there are just as many A-list and B-list celebrities. There are probably fewer A-plus ones.”This being Washington, all sorts of companies, organizations and federal agencies are trying to get in on the act. Knob Creek, the Kentucky bourbon maker, is promoting itself as “the exclusive whiskey being served” at a candlelight celebration Mr. Obama is hosting for his donors at the National Building Museum on Sunday night. The National Archives, in a rare treat for history buffs, is marking the inauguration by putting two pages of George Washington’s first Inaugural Address — a document ordinarily in a vault — on display.“It’s one of those documents that I informally call a goose bump — it gives me goose bumps,” said Michael Hussey, the curator of the exhibit, which closes at the end of the month.Though some view the inauguration as partisan, Steve Kerrigan, chairman of Mr. Obama’s inaugural committee, said he and his staff hoped that Americans would “walk away from this with the sense that it is not just a celebration of the president, but a celebration of the entire country.”That is the view of Mrs. Ing, the volunteer from Ohio. She voted for Mitt Romney, Mr. Obama’s Republican opponent. This is her fifth inaugural making centerpieces for the Illinois ball.“Every inaugural seems different,” she said. “Different energy, different people. I think everybody should do it at least once.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/politics/for-president-and-chief-justice-another-chance-to-get-it-right.html,"WASHINGTON — The combination of Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and President Obama creates a version of a physics problem: How can such smooth personalities create so much friction?That conundrum was on display four years ago, when these two supremely capable men managed to botch the simple task of reciting the presidential oath at Mr. Obama’s first inauguration.The moment was not an anomaly. It is hard to think of a major public encounter between the two that has not gone badly awry or been tinged with hard feelings.In other settings, they are cool, cerebral and polished, and neither is given to gaffes or insults. Together, they seem to rub each other the wrong way.They will have another chance on Monday to display the consummate competence that has marked their individual ascents to the summits of their respective branches of government when they will take another stab at a call-and-response recitation of the presidential oath set out in the Constitution.The roots of the tense relationship can be traced to 2005, when Mr. Obama, then a senator, did what he could to deny Chief Justice Roberts the job he now holds. In explaining why he cast one of just 22 votes against the nomination, Mr. Obama started by praising his fellow Harvard Law graduate’s temperament and legal skill. He might as well have been talking about himself.But Mr. Obama followed the praise with a caustic assessment of the nominee’s work as a lawyer in Republican administrations.“He has far more often used his formidable skills on behalf of the strong in opposition to the weak,” Mr. Obama said, accusing the nominee of not having done enough to fight race discrimination and what he called the unfair treatment of women in the workplace.The differences in the two men’s worldviews have been on display ever since. The first piece of legislation Mr. Obama signed into law, for instance, was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009. It reversed a 5-to-4 decision, with the chief justice in the majority, that had limited the ability of women to sue for pay discrimination.But it was the Citizens United decision in 2010, which allowed unlimited election spending by corporations, that provoked the most memorable public clashes. Just days after the decision, Mr. Obama used his State of the Union address to criticize Chief Justice Roberts and five of his colleagues to their faces, saying their decision would “open the floodgates for special interests, including foreign corporations, to spend without limit in our elections.”The chief justice sat seething. A couple of months later, in remarks at a law school, he said the event had been “a political pep rally.”“I’m not sure why we are there,” he said. “The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think, is very troubling.”After the arguments last March over the constitutionality of Mr. Obama’s health care overhaul law, the president took the unusual step of launching what sounded like a pre-emptive attack, or at least a brushback pitch, aimed at the chief justice.“I am confident that the Supreme Court will not take what would be an unprecedented, extraordinary step of overturning a law that was passed by a strong majority of a democratically elected Congress,” he said.In June, Chief Justice Roberts broke with his usual allies to vote to uphold the law, handing Mr. Obama an election-season gift. But he went out of his way to suggest that the law, even if it barely cleared the constitutional bar, did not seem like a good idea.“It is not our job,” he wrote, “to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices.”Monday’s inaugural ceremony would be stressful enough without this tense personal history. After all, when the two men stepped on each other’s lines four years ago, they managed to provoke the first crisis of the Obama administration. When administration lawyers expressed worry that Mr. Obama had not actually assumed the presidency, a do-over was quietly arranged the next day in the Map Room of the White House.The authoritative account of the entire debacle is in Jeffrey Toobin’s “The Oath: The Obama White House and the Supreme Court.” The resourceful Mr. Toobin tracked down an audio recording of the Map Room oath that a newspaper pool reporter had had the presence of mind to keep. As the second try was about to start, Mr. Obama urged the chief justice to take it slowly this time.Mr. Toobin relied on ellipses to capture the tone of the president’s comment: “His remark to the chief justice had an ... edge.” Mr. Obama’s second inauguration will again feature two opportunities to tackle the oath. The chief justice is scheduled to administer the one that counts in a small ceremony in the Blue Room of the White House on Sunday, in time for the noon deadline set by the Constitution.Then the president and the chief justice will find themselves face to face before the nation on Monday, required only to recite a familiar set of words in the right order. Piece of cake.Should there be trouble, though, Mr. Obama’s allies will not be quick to blame the chief justice who rescued the health care law. “Given health care,” said Robert Gibbs, who served as Mr. Obama’s press secretary, “I don’t care if he speaks in tongues.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/politics/other-proposals-taking-precedence-in-congress-over-gun-ban.html,"WASHINGTON — As Senate Democrats grapple with how much of President Obama’s broad gun control agenda is politically achievable, or even desirable, Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, chairman of the committee with jurisdiction over gun laws, said that moving to tighten background checks should be a top priority.“One of the first things you want to do is close the gun-show loophole,” said Mr. Leahy, in an interview for C-SPAN’s “Newsmakers,” referring to a legal provision that permits unlicensed gun sellers to sell to people without conducting background checks. The loophole is a small piece of a much broader agenda introduced by Mr. Obama on Wednesday, one that faces considerable, though not insurmountable, odds on Capitol Hill.The view of Mr. Leahy, a Democrat with a history of supporting some gun rights, is crucial because the work of his Judiciary Committee will be central to advancing any new gun legislation.He declined to detail precisely how the committee, which will hold hearings on potential gun legislation this month, would proceed with Mr. Obama’s request to push legislation that includes a renewal of an assault weapons ban, a limit on magazine size and universal background checks.Mr. Leahy’s plans will also be closely watched by senators with their own gun control legislative agendas, lawmakers who may decide to push their own bills if the committee process does not yield the results they seek.The 2004 expiration of the assault weapons ban tipped off the beginning of a new era in gun rights, one in which legislation began to tilt in favor of laws that strengthened, rather than chipped away at, gun owners’ rights to own all types of weapons, as well as where and how they could be carried. An attempt to renew that law, which opponents in both parties say did little to stem gun violence in the 10 years it was in effect, faces formidable opposition.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, who finds himself trapped between the desires of Mr. Obama and those of his conservative Democratic colleagues who would prefer not to have to vote on gun measures, has already signaled that that particular element of Mr. Obama’s agenda is in trouble.“Is it something that can pass the Senate?” he said recently on a Nevada television program about a renewed assault weapons ban. “Maybe. Is it something that can pass the House? I doubt it.”Mr. Leahy said, “I have told my staff I’d like to get a definitive answer if we can: ‘Did an assault weapon ban work?’ ”It is a question that many Democrats and Republicans alike continue to pose.It is possible that the Obama administration, which spent its first four years negotiating with Congress by offering its strongest hand up front, may use that legislation as a bargaining chip that it is willing to sacrifice to obtain the rest of its agenda.Some Democrats, particularly Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, believe the best path to pursue is universal background checks for gun owners, which Mr. Schumer called “the sweet spot” among legislative paths. But such legislation would be scrutinized carefully for its details.For example, in many states and rural areas, guns frequently change hands privately through sales to family members or neighbors, which could complicate background check procedures. But if written narrowly, a background check provision could potentially win bipartisan support.One of the clearest impediments to mass killings, gun control advocates say, is a limit on the size of magazines permitted for civilian gun owners. “I’ve never known a gun owner in Vermont who says, ‘No, I’ve got to have 30 rounds,’ ” Mr. Leahy said.A measure limiting magazines has been drawing bipartisan backing since the school massacre in Newtown, Conn. “I’m going to support the limitation on the size of the clips,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine. Such a bill, narrowly written, “might well pass,” she said.Senator Angus King of Maine, the newly elected Independent, has said that he supports universal background checks and limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines as well, but is waiting to see specific legislative language on all of the proposals, including an assault weapons ban.The biggest problem may be marrying too many components in one bill. For example, a measure that Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, is working on would reinstitute the ban on assault weapons but also limit magazines. Such a measure would probably enjoy the support of some big-city mayors and the like, but could be met coolly by other Democrats, particularly those from conservative states who are up for re-election in 2014.Any legislation that managed to get through the Senate would have a tougher ride in the House.“The necessity of having that legislation here instead of in the states is lost on me,” said Representative Rob Woodall, Republican of Georgia. “Folks in New York may have less of that grandfather-to-grandson exchange that we have in Georgia that takes place under the Christmas tree every year.”Mr. Leahy said legislation would be shaped after he heard from a range of witnesses in his hearings. He said he had invited Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association.The N.R.A. did not respond to an inquiry about whether Mr. LaPierre would attend."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/politics/a-white-house-aware-of-second-term-perils.html,"WASHINGTON — As he tucked into a salad and a beef pastry, President Obama looked around the family dining room in the White House and stared into his future. By some forecasts, it may not be a pretty sight.Gathered with him that evening were several of the nation’s leading historians, who reminded him of the sorry litany of second terms — the cascade of scandal, war, recession, political defeat and other calamities that afflicted past presidents after the heady crescendo of re-election.For Mr. Obama, who will be sworn in for another four years in a quiet ceremony on Sunday and then again in more public fashion on Monday, the lessons were familiar if daunting. Embarking on the next half of his presidency, he and his advisers are developing a second-term strategy intended to avoid the pitfalls of his predecessors with a robust agenda focused on the economy, gun control, immigration and energy.“We’ve talked a lot about this,” said David Plouffe, the president’s senior adviser who is leaving the White House at the end of the week. “We have spent a lot of time trying to figure out both what to pursue but also these issues of making sure you’re bringing the same sort of energy and same sort of focus as the first term.”After studying the past, the president’s team concluded that it was important to make the most of the first year of his second term and stick rigorously to issues he articulated on the campaign trail. “If you stay in that zone,” Mr. Plouffe said, “I think you avoid a lot of those potential dangers.”But of course, this is not the first re-elected president to think that. Others arrived at this point with similar confidence, only to be hobbled by developments. Some past second-term troubles stemmed from hubris, exhaustion or miscalculation; others arrived out of the blue.Franklin D. Roosevelt found the economy relapsing and lost a fight to pack the Supreme Court. Richard M. Nixon was forced to resign by the Watergate scandal. Ronald Reagan was caught up in the Iran-contra affair. Bill Clinton was impeached, though not convicted, for lying under oath about his affair with Monica Lewinsky. George W. Bush was damaged by the Iraq war, Hurricane Katrina and a financial crash.At the same time, as the historians made clear to Mr. Obama at their dinner this month, there were still second-term opportunities. Reagan overhauled the tax code and signed a new arms control treaty with the Soviet Union. Mr. Clinton balanced the budget and successfully led the Kosovo war. Mr. Bush turned the Iraq war around with a surge of troops and a strategy change and forestalled a new depression in his final weeks in office.“In general, the historical record is not one of great hope,” said Robert Dallek, one of the historians at the dinner. “He’s fully aware of the circumstances he confronts, but he’s also upbeat about the fact that he won, and won convincingly. It wasn’t a landslide, but it certainly was a convincing victory.”Indeed, during the course of a free-ranging two-and-a-half-hour conversation, the historians were struck by how much Mr. Obama had thought about his second term in the context of his predecessors. He was focused particularly on Dwight D. Eisenhower, another president who ended a war and tried to curb military spending. “His knowledge of what other presidents did in their second terms, what happened in their second terms, it’s very impressive,” said Robert A. Caro, the Lyndon B. Johnson biographer.Mr. Obama has made clear in public settings as well how attuned he is to the opportunities and challenges confronting him, including history’s warning signs. “I’m more than familiar with all the literature about presidential overreach in second terms,” he said shortly after his re-election. “We are very cautious about that. On the other hand, I didn’t get re-elected just to bask in re-election. I got elected to do work on behalf of American families and small businesses all across the country.”Mr. Obama has the unusual distinction of being the third president in a row to win two terms; the last time that happened was when James Monroe followed Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Monroe, however, was re-elected effectively without opposition and presided over what was called the Era of Good Feelings. Mr. Obama, it seems safe to say, is presiding over the opposite.With the House in Republican hands, Mr. Obama has an uphill struggle simply to deal with various spending deadlines, much less advance a proactive agenda. Within the White House, advisers debate just how much time he has to push through big legislative initiatives before he invariably loses political capital. They noted that Mr. Clinton had a year before scandal erupted, while Mr. Bush had just seven months before Hurricane Katrina sapped his public standing.“You hope for a year and a half. You understand it could be half that,” said Robert Gibbs, the former White House press secretary who worked on the re-election campaign. “You’ve got to have a really, really good plan for 12 months in hopes it lasts for 16 or 18. But you have to be mindful that every day the window gets a little narrower and you’ve got to seize the moment.”Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to the president, said Mr. Obama would tap public opinion to maintain clout. “One way of keeping Congress accountable is this constant engagement with the American people, and I know that’s something he’s committed to doing even more so in a second term,” she said.Douglas Brinkley, a Rice University historian who was at the dinner with Mr. Obama, said that the notion of a second-term curse was overstated, but that the president would have to be assertive to remain relevant. “You have to be willing to be a strong executive-power president in your second term; otherwise, you become a lame duck,” he said.Mr. Obama’s first term was in its own way cursed as much as anyone else’s second term, or at least replete with the sorts of crises that would challenge any presidency: the Great Recession, the collapsing auto industry, the biggest offshore oil spill in American history and two wars. Much of the worst, his advisers hope, may now be behind him.“The advantage now is he’s not facing almost unprecedented economic trouble, which really colored his first year,” said Phil Schiliro, his former legislative director. “This is really the first time in his presidency when he’s not facing a crisis like that. The wars are winding down, the economy’s getting better. That gives him more breathing room.”Some presidential second-term troubles were really manifestations of first-term actions, including the Watergate burglary under Nixon, the secret arms sales to Iran under Reagan, the liaisons by Mr. Clinton and the invasion of Iraq by Mr. Bush. While there have been flaps during Mr. Obama’s first term over investments in a failed clean energy company, a bungled anti-gun operation and the attack in Benghazi, Libya, nothing of historic magnitude is evident at the moment. But Mr. Obama’s staff worries that the biggest risks would be not effectively carrying out the health care program coming into full force in the second term or the economy’s not bouncing back more strongly by the time he leaves office.Still, as he prepared to take the oath again, Mr. Obama struck the historians as relaxed and engaged, especially compared with their last dinner with him before the election, when they sensed the tension that gripped him. For now, the path for the next four years is open and he has a chance to shape it.“You don’t have anything to run for anymore,” Mr. Caro said. “You’re running for a place in history.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/politics/after-4-years-friends-see-shifts-in-obamas.html,"Barack and Michelle Obama have spent more than a thousand days on display before the nation’s eyes, but the personal changes they have undergone can be hard to detect.Up close, though, those who know the Obamas say they can see an accumulation of small shifts in the president and the first lady since they walked the inaugural parade route four years ago. The man who wanted to change the nature of Washington now warns job candidates that it is hard to get anything done there. Not so long ago, he told others that he did not need a presidential library, a tribute to himself costing hundreds of millions of dollars. Now a former aide, Susan Sher, is quietly eyeing possibilities for him in Chicago.The first lady who wanted to forge connections with her new city found that even viewing the cherry blossoms required a hat, sunglasses and wheedling the Secret Service. In a demonstration of how difficult it can be for any president or first lady to sustain relationships, Mrs. Obama stopped taking on girls in a mentorship program she founded because of concerns that other teenagers would envy the lucky advisees, according to an aide.When the president returned from consoling families of teachers and children killed in the Newtown, Conn., massacre — he wept as they handed him photos and told him stories of victim after victim — aides could see in his face the toll of absorbing the nation’s traumas. “This is what I do,” Mr. Obama told them.“This position has perhaps cost him more on a personal, and even energic, level than most of his predecessors, because he was most entirely an outsider,” observed the playwright Tony Kushner, a supporter who recently dined with Mr. Obama to discuss the film “Lincoln,” for which Mr. Kushner wrote the screenplay.The Obamas have gained and lost in their four years in the White House, becoming seasoned professionals instead of newcomers, more conventional, with a contracted sense of possibility. They are steady characters, not given to serial self-reinvention. Yet in interviews, current and former White House and campaign aides, donors and friends from Chicago said they could see how the president and the first lady had been affected by their roles.Describing them, they used phrases like: more confident but more scarred. More isolated. Less hesitant about directing staff members, whether butlers or highest-level advisers. Gratified by re-election, which the Obamas view as sweet vindication, and bloodier-minded when it comes to beating Republicans. And Mr. Obama has learned that his presidency will be shaped by unanticipated events — “locusts,” one former aide called them, for the way they swarm without warning.Mr. Obama never wanted to be an ordinary politician — there was a time when Mrs. Obama could barely use that noun to describe her husband — and his advisers resist the idea that he has succumbed to standard Washington practice. Some donors and aides give an “if only” laugh at the idea that the couple now follows political ritual more closely: this is a president who still has not had Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton to dinner but holds lunches to discuss moral philosophy with the fellow Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel.“He thinks about destiny in human terms,” Mr. Wiesel said in an interview.Still, others say the Obamas have become more relaxed schmoozers, more at ease with the porous line between the political and social, more willing to reveal themselves. They have recently begun inviting more outsiders into their private living quarters, including Mr. Kushner, Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis at the “Lincoln” dinner. At a dinner in late November to thank top campaign fund-raisers, the first couple was like a bride and groom, bantering and traveling from table to table to accept congratulations and good wishes for the years ahead, making sly jokes that guests would not repeat for publication.Even Mr. Obama’s speech has changed a bit, close observers say. Though he still disdains Washington, he often sounds less like a disapproving outsider and more like a participant. One former aide was startled to hear Mr. Obama use “impact” as a verb, a particular tendency in the capital. Another longtime adviser said he was struck during the 2011 debt ceiling negotiations when Mr. Obama grew offended that House Speaker John A. Boehner did not return his multiple phone calls. The old Barack Obama would have thought the who-calls-whom protocol was stupid, the adviser said, but “the world that he inhabits now is the world of inside-the-Beltway maneuvering.”In video footage of Mr. Obama as president, the contrasts can be subtle but amusing. At his first Thanksgiving turkey pardoning ceremony in 2009, the president played along, but then paused to distance himself from what he was doing and hint that he found the tradition ridiculous. “There are certain days that remind me of why I ran for this office,” he said. “And then there are moments like this — where I pardon a turkey and send it to Disneyland.” Cut to the same ceremony, three years later, and cue Mr. Obama promoting a contest over which bird to pardon and giggling just a little. “You can’t maintain your day-to-day cynicism about that stuff,” said Arun Chaudhary, the former White House videographer, because many Americans cherish White House rituals.What Mr. Obama wants to achieve this term is pretty clear: a fiscal deal and overhauls of gun and immigration laws, steps to address climate change and less restrictive voter identification laws. But what Mrs. Obama wants is more of a mystery. In almost every appearance, she sounds warm, unpretentious notes; on Friday, she continued her Twitter banter with Ellen DeGeneres over who could do more push-ups.That informal tone can mask how disciplined she is. Though many surrounding the Obamas say she has changed far more than her husband, mastering a role she initially found uncomfortable, she still treats the job of first lady like a dangerous country through which she must navigate safe passage. The woman who never wanted to live in the bubble now uses it to protect herself, according to friends and former aides, preparing her public activities in 6- and 12-month strategic plans, rarely saying anything unscripted. First ladies are often figures of comfort, but she did not address the Newtown tragedy, beyond two brief letters she published, even though some of her fans were clamoring for the self-described “mom in chief” to do more.In recent weeks, Mrs. Obama and her advisers have been discussing whether to expand her work beyond childhood obesity and military families and how to capitalize on her popularity. On Friday, she threw herself into her husband’s new effort to organize supporters, introducing the group, Organizing for Action, in an announcement video. (The effort did not seem to garner as much attention as her new hairstyle, which set off headlines like “Michelle Obama’s Bangs Are a Total Shock to the System.”)Mrs. Obama cannot wait too long to set out on a new course: the Obamas will soon have more time behind them in the White House than in front of them. The rituals they introduced are now matters of tradition instead of innovation. At their White House Seder, the small group of mostly African-American and Jewish attendees reads the Emancipation Proclamation right before welcoming Elijah, just as the year before. The president played basketball on Election Day 2012, as he did on most of the voting days in 2008. But this time it felt different: the men older, the action slower, a reunion game with everyone talking about the old days, said John Rogers Jr., a longtime friend who joined in.Mr. Obama’s entire career has been about getting to the next stage: if he could only become a lawyer, and then a public official, and then a United States senator, and then president, he could create real change. But soon there will be no higher job to reach for, and aides say there is an all-business quality to the Obamas now, a contrast with the sense of possibility that hung over the first inauguration. Early in the presidency, Mr. Obama would sometimes spend hours polishing ceremonial speeches, like one for Abraham Lincoln’s bicentennial; now, the president has a more finely honed sense of how to use his precious time, said Adam Frankel, a former speechwriter. When Mr. Obama walked off the stage on election night, he did not pause to exult; instead, he wanted to talk about the impact of outside spending in that night’s Congressional races, said Patrick Gaspard, the director of the Democratic National Committee.But Mr. Obama also knows now that he is not fully in control of his fate, that the presidency will continue to bring tasks that no one could ever anticipate. Mr. and Mrs. Obama were supposed to spend the evening of Dec. 16 enjoying their daughter Sasha’s “Nutcracker” recital. Instead, the president was making condolence calls in cordoned-off rooms at Newtown High School.“Words don’t exist” to describe the grief on his face as he approached the families, said Sarah D’Avino, whose sister Rachel died protecting her students. The president asked each family to describe the relative who died, paying special attention to the victims’ mothers. Mourning parents handed him pictures to carry back to the White House, and he told them that the children were beautiful, that the teachers were national heroes.Moments later, he was smiling, on cue. One of his photographers was on hand, as always, and despite everything, the bereaved wanted pictures with the president."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/politics/medicaid-expansion-is-delicate-maneuver-for-arizona-governor.html,"PHOENIX — Gov. Jan Brewer called it “one of the most difficult decisions” of her 30 years in public service.If she chose to expand Medicaid, the federal and state program that provides health care to poor and disabled people, she risked antagonizing her conservative base, steadfast opponents of President Obama’s health care law. If she did not, she risked missing a solid chance of shifting the way she is viewed by a Latino population of increasing political influence, beyond her stern positions on immigration.Ms. Brewer, who has become something of a conservative icon for her aggressive opposition to Mr. Obama’s policies, surprised many Legislature watchers at her State of the State address last week by saying she wanted to expand the state’s Medicaid program to include anyone who makes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, or $14,856 for an individual. The risk if Arizona does otherwise, she said, is losing the federal funds and the health care jobs that come with the changes.It could be simply a case of math trumping ideology: In 2014, the first full year of the expansion, Arizona stands to gain $1.6 billion in federal matching funds, Ms. Brewer said. (The federal government would cover the full cost of the new beneficiaries in the early years and 90 percent of the cost after 2020.)Her fellow Republican governors in the Southwest, Susana Martinez of New Mexico and Brian Sandoval of Nevada, used a similar argument to justify their decisions to do the same thing. But it was Ms. Brewer whom National Review Online, the conservative publication, singled out for criticism in an editorial, saying she exemplified “that unfortunately common strain of Republican leadership that is uncompromising in rhetoric but opportunistic in reality.” Americans for Prosperity, the conservative advocacy group, also circulated a paragraph-by-paragraph rebuttal of the arguments she used to support her choice.Expanding Medicaid is a central element in Mr. Obama’s plan to provide health coverage for virtually every American, as it could add as many as 17 million people to the rolls. Last month, his administration made it an all-or-nothing proposition, saying it would not cover partial expansions, a move that left many Republican governors who were hoping for such a middle-of-the-way option looking for a different way.Both demography and geography are playing a role in which governors are choosing to expand Medicaid and which are not, observers said. Republican governors bucked the party line in the Southwest, where Latinos are at once a significant slice of the poor population and a powerful voting bloc. But in the South, Republican governors have stayed in unwavering opposition to expanding Medicaid or embracing any of the voluntary aspects of Mr. Obama’s health care law.“The South is Republican, and it’s getting more Republican, so there is very little political risk there in letting the hard-right Republican philosophy take over” despite the region’s substantial number of poor residents without health insurance, said Richard White, a professor of history at Stanford University.The expansion in Arizona, which requires state legislative approval, is popular among Latino voters, who lean heavily Democratic, and among Latinos in general, who stand to gain the most from it. A report by NCLR, a Latino advocacy organization also known as the National Council of La Raza, said the national expansion of Medicaid would account for about half of the Latinos newly insured under the health care law across the country, with about 3.1 million additional Latinos covered by the program.Gabriel Sanchez, the research director at Latino Decisions, a polling group, said the future of politics in the West “is largely connected to expansion of the Latino electorate,” so siding with issues that matter to them “is sometimes a matter of survival” in politics.In Nevada, where the expansion is projected to enroll 78,000 people and bring in more than $700 million in federal funds over the first three years, Mr. Sandoval immediately received the support of the Republican leadership in the State Senate. In New Mexico, where the expansion would add 208,000 people to the program and bring in roughly $5 billion through 2022, no one was surprised that Ms. Martinez decided to go the way she did.Ms. Martinez and Mr. Sandoval walk a fine line: They are Republican governors in increasingly Democratic states that voted for Mr. Obama twice. The argument they used to defend their decisions, that expanding Medicaid could bring more money and more jobs, is an easy sell in New Mexico and Nevada, which continue to battle the effects of the economic downturn.As of last week, the only other Republican governor to back the Medicaid expansion was Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota.Ms. Brewer, though, casts a different profile. She is the finger-wagging governor respected in conservative circles for her outspoken criticism of Mr. Obama and unfaltering support of Arizona’s strict immigration legislation, which she fought for all the way to the Supreme Court.But on Wednesday, as she stood surrounded by health care executives at a news conference that seemed more like a pep rally, she was repeatedly called “compassionate,” not a word often used to describe her. The health care industry had lobbied hard for her support of the Medicaid expansion, hiring her former budget director, Peter Burns, and Chuck Coughlin, her campaign strategist, to guide their efforts.Ms. Brewer’s plan includes a “circuit breaker” to automatically freeze coverage for childless adults if the federal government drops its share of matching funds below 80 percent.When first announcing her decision on Monday, she said, “I will not allow Obamacare to become a bait and switch.” By Wednesday, she had a more benign assessment, “There’s no way you can look at this issue and say this is not the right thing for Arizona at this time.”Under the expansion, Arizona is expected to add about 240,000 people to its Medicaid rolls.Barrett Marson, a public relations consultant who has worked for several Arizona Republicans, said Ms. Brewer’s decision was, in part, “about saying, ‘I want to show America who I really am,’ and that person is a compassionate conservative who thinks there should be a safety net for people in the bottom rung.”She wants to prove she is “not all about immigration,” he said.Several hard-line Republicans decided not to seek re-election for the Arizona Legislature or were voted out of office last year. One was Russell K. Pearce, a senator who was the sponsor and chief champion of the state’s immigration bill. That, and the fact that there are several Republican legislators whose positions are vulnerable, may also have weighed in the governor’s calculation.“In the South, you can continue to flog the immigration horse,” said Professor White of Stanford, “but no longer in the Southwest.” "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/world/asia/rahul-gandhi-rises-to-no-2-post-in-indian-party.html,"NEW DELHI — Rahul Gandhi, the heir apparent of an Indian political dynasty, was formally elevated Saturday to the No. 2 position in India’s ruling National Congress Party, making him second only to his mother, Sonia Gandhi.Mr. Gandhi was appointed party vice president, but whether he will serve as the party’s candidate for prime minister in elections scheduled for next year is still unclear. Mr. Gandhi has long been expected to assume the mantle of his family’s and his party’s leadership, but his uncertain political skills and seeming reluctance to assert himself had held him back. Speculation had been building about whether this was the year that he would step firmly into the spotlight.Mr. Gandhi’s elevation took place at a meeting of the Congress Party’s policy-making group, the Congress working committee, which unanimously adopted a resolution to make him the party’s No. 2 behind his mother, who remains the party president.Whether Manmohan Singh, the country’s prime minister, will serve as the party’s prime ministerial candidate next year is uncertain, but given his age — he is 80 — it seems unlikely.Equally uncertain is who will be the candidate for the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition. Narendra Modi is now that party’s most successful leader after he recently won a third term as the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat. But Mr. Modi’s unpopularity with Muslims could cost the party crucial allies, so his role in next year’s elections is unknown.Mr. Gandhi has for years headed two youth organizations, the Youth Congress and the National Students Union of India. In recent remarks, Mrs. Gandhi said a key strategy for next year’s election was to find ways to appeal to India’s youth population. Half of India’s population is under the age of 25. Her remarks raised expectations that she would push her son to assume a greater role in the party’s leadership.At 42, Mr. Gandhi is no longer a young man, but he is much younger than much of the rest of India’s leadership class, whose average age is 65."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/its-time-for-texas-to-review-states-ethics-laws.html,"Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.It has been 20 years since a scandal-driven Texas Legislature overhauled the state’s ethics laws. Gently put, officeholders have figured out how to cut some corners.A small example to make the point: they can’t convert campaign funds to personal use, but they can use those funds to rent cars used in their political campaigns. Rules are made to be broken, right? They just have to be reasserted, or revised, from time to time.Maybe it’s time. The Texas Ethics Commission is up for a periodic legislative review.The current Legislature is packed with freshmen and sophomores who haven’t been around long enough to go native — to do business like lawmakers who have grown accustomed to cutting ethical corners. And some of the lawmakers who quit or who got beat or were spooked by challengers in the last election cycle were in harm’s way because of the blurry lines between their official and personal business.One was billing the state and his campaign accounts for the same travel expenses. Another’s spouse was a consultant for a program overseen by the legislator’s committee.Texas lawmakers set up some tough laws to govern themselves, but they haven’t invested much money or interest in enforcement.In practice, a lot of the enforcement of ethics comes in the off-season, when the opposition researchers for political challengers go through incumbents’ records and reports to find the nasty little bits that animate their election attacks.This happens periodically. Two scandals in the 1970s — the Sharpstown stock scandal in Texas and the Watergate scandal in Washington — resulted in a mountain of ethics and campaign reforms, statewide and nationally. Investigations of Congressional and legislative bribery spurred reforms in the 1980s.Texas lawmakers who got way too close to lobbyists — figuratively and literally — sparked the last major set of reforms in the early 1990s.More recently, lawmakers, lobbyists and others inside the bubble of state government have been preoccupied with the absence of clear boundaries between professional and legislative business. In addition to the sunset legislation of the Ethics Commission — a periodic state agency review that is an obvious vessel for new ethics laws — legislators have filed bills promised in their last campaigns.Two freshmen — Representatives Giovanni Capriglione, Republican of Southlake, and Mary González, Democrat of Clint — propose forcing lawmakers to disclose the government clients of their personal businesses. Senator Wendy Davis, Democrat of Fort Worth, jumped to file companion legislation in the Senate; her political opponent last year tried to make an issue of the local government business done by her private law firm.It’s easy to think of a political group — the Legislature, the city council, the school board, the utility district — as inherently corrupt. Sometimes, they do their best to prove it. That is not really the problem here. The problem is that under the current ethics laws, it’s very hard to prove the opposite. It can be difficult to tell an honest lawmaker from a lawmaker who is on the make.Start, if you can, with the assumption that most people in public office are honest and are serving with the best of intentions, even if you disagree with their politics. Assume they are reasonably intelligent. And think about what happens when you give intelligent people a set of rules. Over time, they figure out the best way to read the rules, to stay within the law while also taking every legal advantage.Over time, things get out of balance. It might be that most people are following the laws on the books, but that the everyday level of questionable behavior is out of hand.For instance, Texas requires judges to grant continuances to lawyers who, as legislators, can’t make it to court because of official state business. Makes sense, right? You don’t want to lose your lawsuit because your lawyer is also a senator who was voting on something instead of coming to the courthouse.But it didn’t take long for somebody smart to hire a legislator-lawyer to take advantage of the time delays automatic continuances can provide. Or for a legislator or two to turn that into an easy way to make money.Lawmakers came back and limited those continuances. They were legal and widespread, but poisonous — something that might turn up in their campaigns.There’s more there."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/opinion/why-obama-cant-stop-raising-money.html,"ANNAPOLIS, Md.IN the last campaign cycle, Barack Obama headlined 220 fund-raisers, unprecedented for a presidential re-election effort, and collected more than $1 billion. So one might think that he should be free to focus exclusively on governing. But that’s not likely.There was a time when periods of campaigning and of governing were clearly divided. “Since he is President, he cannot be politically active until well after the July Convention,” advisers to President Harry S. Truman wrote in a 1947 pre-campaign memo. “He must be President of all the people and not merely the leader of a party, until the very last minute.”That time is long gone. Mr. Obama’s first term bore the two hallmarks of what has become the permanent campaign: disproportionate travel to key electoral states and substantial time dedicated to political fund-raising from practically the moment he took office.The president’s time is, as Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, has said, “the most precious resource in the White House.” Why, then, would Mr. Obama, who does not have to face the voters again, feel the need to stump in his second term?The answer goes back to the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, which were intended to limit the role of money in our electoral system but which have become largely anachronistic. Individual contributions were limited, so presidents were forced to spend ever more time raising fairly small contributions from large numbers of donors, particularly as TV advertising became more prevalent and expensive. Meanwhile, in 1976 the Supreme Court struck down limits on Congressional campaign expenditures, adding to the pressure on presidents to raise money for their fellow party members.Ronald Reagan’s 100 second-term fund-raisers topped the 80 he attended in his first term. In 1986, he tried unsuccessfully to preserve his party’s control of the Senate, which Republicans had won six years earlier on the coattails of his 1980 presidential victory. In his final two years in the White House, Reagan kept raising money, to aid his party, Senate candidates and George Bush, who became the first sitting vice president elected to the presidency since 1836.Bill Clinton headlined 471 second-term fund-raisers — almost triple his first-term total of 167. He was committed to retiring the Democratic National Committee’s substantial debt following the 1996 election. Then, before the 1998 midterms and amid the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal, he tried to help his party retake Congress from the Republicans, who had swept both chambers in 1994. (Congress remained in Republican hands, and Mr. Clinton was impeached by the House but then acquitted by the Senate.) In his final years in office he raised yet more money, to help his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who moved to New York to run for the Senate, as well Vice President Al Gore, who campaigned to succeed him.George W. Bush headlined 155 fund-raisers in his second term; he was on course to surpass the 173 in his first term until the 2008 financial crisis made him cancel a series of appearances. He failed to block the Democrats from taking both houses of Congress in 2006. But even as his approval ratings plunged to record lows, he remained his party’s most prolific fund-raiser until he left office.Since Mr. Obama took office, the permanent campaign has ramped up even more. Last year, neither major-party presidential nominee accepted public financing for the first time since the program was created as a pillar of the reforms of the ’70s. The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which empowered outside political groups to raise money free from contribution limits, has only added to the fund-raising demands on the president.Presidents are frequently criticized for campaigning instead of governing, but in a highly polarized era without lasting Congressional majorities, the stakes every two years grow ever higher: witness the gridlock between the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican majority in the House. For the White House, campaigning does not come at the expense of governing but facilitates the possibility of more effective governing — not to mention the establishment of a political legacy.Mr. Obama has already pledged to raise money for the special election in Massachusetts for the seat that Senator John Kerry will vacate if he is confirmed as secretary of state. Unlimited campaign spending, relatively low contribution limits and narrow margins of party control in both houses of a bitterly divided Congress ensure that the fund-raising will only accelerate. After all, the battle of 2014 is already under way."

He is bursting with fervor to fight compromise and consensus-building in Washington wherever it is found. Unlike 85 percent of the Republicans in the Senate, he would have voted against the fiscal cliff deal. He says gun control is unconstitutional. Breaking even with conservative business leaders, he would have no qualms about using the debt ceiling as a hostage because he believes (falsely) that it would produce only a partial government shutdown and not default.Considering the damage that this kind of thinking did to the country and the Republican Party over the last two years — a downgraded credit rating, legislative standoffs, popular anger, a loss of Republican seats — it might seem obvious that the party should marginalize lawmakers like Mr. Cruz. Instead, they continue to gain power and support. Party leaders named Mr. Cruz vice chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.In recent weeks, it appeared that party leaders might have started to realize the political costs of saying no to everything. Senator Mitch McConnell and Speaker John Boehner grasped that the fiscal-cliff deal with President Obama was quite favorable to Republicans, compared with no deal, and supported its passage. Last month, Mr. Boehner purged four Tea Party ringleaders from their committees. On Friday, House leaders temporarily backed off their debt-ceiling threat.But both men have been vilified by the right wing. Mr. Boehner won a surprisingly narrow re-election as speaker, enduring a revolt by a dozen members of his caucus. One of the ringleaders was Tim Huelskamp of Kansas, who was earlier booted from his seats on the Budget and Agriculture Committees for constantly defying the speaker. Conservative groups are running ads against Mr. McConnell in Kentucky, where he is up for re-election next year and is likely to face a primary opponent.“Mitch McConnell, whose side are you on?” says one of the ads, accusing him of betraying conservative principles by agreeing to tax hikes.Mitt Romney’s decisive loss, and the plunge in popular support for the Tea Party, should have sent a clear message to Republican leaders in Congress. Steve LaTourette, an Ohio Republican who just retired from his House seat, said the dozen insurrectionists should be kicked out of the party caucus, since they “don’t have a clue” how to legislate. Even Ralph Reed, the former leader of the Christian Coalition, said Republicans need to pick up on clear shifts in demographics and attitudes. “The Republican Party can’t stay exactly where it is and stick its head in the sand and ignore the fact that the country is changing,” he told The Times this month.The upcoming session will give Republican leaders a chance to ignore pressure from the right and begin working with Democrats. The tests are coming quickly: Will they block all gun-control proposals and a reasonable immigration plan? Will they force a government shutdown to resist new revenues and demand cuts to safety-net programs? If the answers to these questions are yes, the party will remain hijacked by its most shrill minority."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/obamas-second-inaugural-speech.html,"The following is a transcript of President Obama’s second inaugural speech. For anyone who wants something shorter, The Times has condensed the speech in a way that keeps its main themes. No words have been changed, but roughly 60 percent of the text has been removed.MR. OBAMA: Vice President Biden, Mr. Chief Justice, Members of the United States Congress, distinguished guests, and fellow citizens:Each time we gather to inaugurate a president, we bear witness to the enduring strength of our Constitution. We affirm the promise of our democracy. We recall that what binds this nation together is not the colors of our skin or the tenets of our faith or the origins of our names. What makes us exceptional – what makes us American – is our allegiance to an idea, articulated in a declaration made more than two centuries ago:“We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.”Today we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time. For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth. The patriots of 1776 did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob. They gave to us a Republic, a government of, and by, and for the people, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed.For more than two hundred years, we have.Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free. We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.Together, we determined that a modern economy requires railroads and highways to speed travel and commerce; schools and colleges to train our workers.Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play.Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune.Through it all, we have never relinquished our skepticism of central authority, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone. Our celebration of initiative and enterprise; our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character.But we have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of fascism or communism with muskets and militias. No single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores. Now, more than ever, we must do these things together, as one nation, and one people.This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. A decade of war is now ending. An economic recovery has begun. America’s possibilities are limitless, for we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention. My fellow Americans, we are made for this moment, and we will seize it – so long as we seize it together.For we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it. We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class. We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship. We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American, she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.We understand that outworn programs are inadequate to the needs of our time. We must harness new ideas and technology to remake our government, revamp our tax code, reform our schools, and empower our citizens with the skills they need to work harder, learn more, reach higher. But while the means will change, our purpose endures: a nation that rewards the effort and determination of every single American. That is what this moment requires. That is what will give real meaning to our creed.We, the people, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity. We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty, and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn. We do not believe that in this country, freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few. We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us, at any time, may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in a terrible storm. The commitments we make to each other – through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security – these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us. They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity. We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations. Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition; we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries – we must claim its promise. That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure – our forests and waterways; our croplands and snowcapped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. That’s what will lend meaning to the creed our fathers once declared.We, the people, still believe that enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war. Our brave men and women in uniform, tempered by the flames of battle, are unmatched in skill and courage. Our citizens, seared by the memory of those we have lost, know too well the price that is paid for liberty. The knowledge of their sacrifice will keep us forever vigilant against those who would do us harm. But we are also heirs to those who won the peace and not just the war, who turned sworn enemies into the surest of friends, and we must carry those lessons into this time as well.We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law. We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully – not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe; and we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation. We will support democracy from Asia to Africa; from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice – not out of mere charity, but because peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity; human dignity and justice.We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths – that all of us are created equal – is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along this great Mall, to hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began. For our journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts. Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law – for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well. Our journey is not complete until no citizen is forced to wait for hours to exercise the right to vote. Our journey is not complete until we find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as a land of opportunity; until bright young students and engineers are enlisted in our workforce rather than expelled from our country. Our journey is not complete until all our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm.That is our generation’s task – to make these words, these rights, these values – of Life, and Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness – real for every American. Being true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness. Progress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time – but it does require us to act in our time.For now decisions are upon us, and we cannot afford delay. We cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate. We must act, we must act knowing that our work will be imperfect. We must act, knowing that today’s victories will be only partial, and that it will be up to those who stand here in four years, and forty years, and four hundred years hence to advance the timeless spirit once conferred to us in a spare Philadelphia hall.My fellow Americans, the oath I have sworn before you today, like the one recited by others who serve in this Capitol, was an oath to God and country, not party or faction – and we must faithfully execute that pledge during the duration of our service. But the words I spoke today are not so different from the oath that is taken each time a soldier signs up for duty, or an immigrant realizes her dream. My oath is not so different from the pledge we all make to the flag that waves above and that fills our hearts with pride.They are the words of citizens, and they represent our greatest hope.You and I, as citizens, have the power to set this country’s course.You and I, as citizens, have the obligation to shape the debates of our time – not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.Let each of us now embrace, with solemn duty and awesome joy, what is our lasting birthright. With common effort and common purpose, with passion and dedication, let us answer the call of history, and carry into an uncertain future that precious light of freedom.Thank you, God Bless you, and may He forever bless these United States of America."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/media/time-warner-cable-ad-campaign-aims-at-regaining-customers.html,"Cable companies big and small have been losing television subscribers — millions of them — to satellite and telecommunications competitors for years. But Time Warner Cable says it is ready to claw some of them back.On Monday, the company — the second-largest cable provider in the country behind Comcast — will begin a marketing campaign aimed at former subscribers who might be having second thoughts about their current video service.The company says it will spend at least $50 million on broadcast, print, online and direct mail ads for the campaign, which it is calling “The Better Guarantee.”The ads convey the idea that while the company’s cable service did not always live up to expectations in the past, it has become better.“We, as a company, are fundamentally different and better than we were a few years ago when these upstart competitors started coming in,” said Jeffrey A. Hirsch, the chief marketing officer for residential services at Time Warner Cable. By upstarts, he was referring to Verizon FiOS and AT&T U-verse, two relatively new fiber optic television and Internet providers that have gained subscribers at the expense of cable providers.Some of the Time Warner Cable ads specifically challenge Verizon, saying it promised monthly savings that have not panned out.“That promise of new isn’t such a great promise, and people are starting to come back to Time Warner Cable,” Mr. Hirsch said. “So we decided it’s time to put some muscle behind the idea.”The campaign announcement comes a week before Time Warner Cable releases its fourth-quarter earnings, which may show deepening losses in television subscribers, known in the industry as basic video subscribers. Industry analysts at Jefferies & Company published a forecast last week that had Time Warner Cable losing 140,000 such subscribers, a slight increase from the 129,000 it lost in the same quarter of 2011. The same forecast had three other cable providers stemming their losses year-over-year.“The Better Guarantee” is an extension of “Enjoy Better,” a brand-image campaign that Time Warner Cable began last February to retain existing subscribers as well as win new ones. The new ads point to specific improvements the company has made: smartphone apps, on-demand TV options and narrower windows of time for home service calls. Gone are the dreaded four-hour windows, the company says; two-hour windows are now the norm and one-hour windows are being put in place.In an interview by phone, Mr. Hirsch also mentioned “much faster Internet than we had two, three years ago” and a home security service.To entice former subscribers to try Time Warner Cable again, the ads promote a 30-day money-back guarantee. “If the consumer doesn’t see that we’ve improved our service, we’ll send them their money back,” said Gregg Fujimoto, a senior vice president for the company.Some of the ads feature actual subscribers, explaining why they came back to the company. Mr. Fujimoto said there would be use of social networking Web sites as well as traditional advertising media.Other cable providers, facing the same competition from satellite and telecommunications providers, have also tried to burnish their reputations lately with ad campaigns. Comcast started a new phase of its marketing for Xfinity, its consumer services, last summer. The providers have also invested an enormous amount of money in infrastructure so that their television and Internet services are on par, or better, than their competition’s.The providers are up against persistent discontent from subscribers who say their monthly bills are too high and their set-top boxes are too slow. Surveys for the University of Michigan’s American Consumer Satisfaction Index have shown for three straight years that Verizon FiOS is the highest-regarded television provider in the country.AT&T and two satellite providers, DirecTV and Dish Network, have also ranked above the industry average, while Time Warner Cable, Comcast and other cable providers have remained below the average. But the 2012 survey had some good news for Time Warner Cable: the company’s score ticked up four percentage points, the most of any television provider on the index."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/blacks-see-new-patience-and-high-expectations-for-obama.html,"The Rev. Greggory L. Brown, a 59-year-old pastor of a small Lutheran church, committed himself to ministry and a life pursuing social justice on April 4, 1968 — the day the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was slain by an assassin’s bullet.And four years ago, like so many African-Americans around the country, he saw Barack Obama’s rise to the presidency as nothing short of a shocking validation of Dr. King’s vision of a more perfect union, where the content of character trumps the color of skin. “I was so excited when he was giving that first inauguration speech,” said Mr. Brown, of Oakland, Calif. “I could feel it in my bones.”On Monday, when President Obama places his hand on Dr. King’s personal Bible to take a second, ceremonial oath of office, he will be symbolically linking himself to the civil rights hero. But Mr. Brown, along with other African-Americans interviewed recently, said their excitement would be laced with a new expectation, that Mr. Obama move to the forefront of his agenda the issues that Dr. King championed: civil rights and racial and economic equality.In interviews with experts and black leaders, some, like Mr. Brown, say they have been disappointed by the slow pace of change for African-Americans, whose children, for instance, are still more likely to live in poverty than those of any other race.“The hope for Obama’s presidency was that there would be more help for places like Oakland and other urban areas that need support, safety and jobs,” Mr. Brown said. “He made people feel like anything is possible.”African-Americans remain overwhelmingly supportive of the president, as evidenced by their enthusiastic turnout on Election Day and for the inauguration festivities and Monday’s holiday celebrating Dr. King’s birthday. Thousands of black Americans have descended on Washington from across the nation for the many parties and observances and visits to the King memorial.They have developed a protective stance toward Mr. Obama, acknowledging the limits of his power and the voraciousness of his critics. Many cite the power of representation, the visual message of a prosperous, cohesive black family being beamed around the country and the world, and the untold aspirations that vision inspires.But African-Americans roundly reject the notion that Mr. Obama’s election has eased racial tensions or delivered the nation to a new post-racial reality.“I think the great mass of black people have shown tremendous patience, discipline and understanding, recognizing the dilemma that he faces,” said Randall L. Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of “The Persistence of the Color Line: Racial Politics and the Obama Presidency.”Still, Professor Kennedy said Mr. Obama had been “somewhat diffident” about issues that would be of special significance to African-Americans, like the disproportionate number of blacks in prison or urban poverty. Blacks understand, he added, that that perceived hesitation “was probably a virtual requirement” for him to be elected in the first place.“Everyone agrees that you wish more was done the first term,” said Debra Lee, the chief executive of Black Entertainment Television. “But you look at politics and realize that the president can’t wave a wand and get things done by himself.”“That’s one of the things we learned in the first term,” she added. “This is important and symbolic, but it’s not the end-all.”As much as many people may have hoped that the impact of race would decline over time, one of the larger surveys on the issue, a poll by The Associated Press  released in October, showed that racial attitudes had not improved in the four years since Mr. Obama took office.It also suggested that prejudice had slightly increased. In a survey by the Pew Research Center conducted in April, a majority of Americans, some 61 percent, disagreed with the statement “Discrimination against blacks is rare today.”Charlene Flynn, a dental assistant in Denver, said she had not noticed any meaningful change in race relations in her own life, but felt that there was a common understanding within the black community that Mr. Obama faced racism on the job. She said she strongly believed that Congress had been defiant toward the president, largely because he is black.“I really think a lot of it has to do with his race, to tell the truth,” said Ms. Flynn, 51.Mr. Brown, the pastor in Oakland, agreed. Each week, he prays aloud for the president. “I believe in my heart he wants to make a difference,” he said. “But every time he tries, people put up a big rock wall.”Others are not so understanding, finding Mr. Obama too cautious on the subject of race.The activist and academic Cornel West says he is outraged that Mr. Obama would use Dr. King’s personal Bible at the inauguration without endorsing Dr. King’s “black freedom struggle.”“Martin went to jail talking about carpet bombing in Vietnam and trying to organize poor people, fighting for civil liberties,” Mr. West said. The president, he said, “has a compromising kind of temperament.”But others in the civil rights movement say the president has a broader role.“I told this president early on that I’ll be the head of the N.A.A.C.P., he can be head of the country,” said Benjamin Todd Jealous, the president of the civil rights organization.He and others credit Mr. Obama’s cool temperament.“Obama very effectively used positive messages to bring the racial and ethnic groups together, not divide them,” said William Julius Wilson, a Harvard sociologist and the author of “More Than Just Race: Being Black and Poor in the Inner City.”“In terms of race and ethnic relations,” Dr. Wilson said, “he is the right president during these hard economic times because social tensions are indeed high.”He said that one need only look back to the death of Trayvon Martin, the unarmed black teenager who was shot last year by a Hispanic neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla., to see the potential volatility of any presidential statement about race, even one where the president asked for “soul-searching.”When Mr. Obama tenderly lamented, “If I had a son, he’d look like Trayvon,” he was attacked by critics like the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh for using the teenager’s death as a “political opportunity.”Blaine Sergew, 43, an immigrant from Ethiopia who lives in Atlanta, said she felt disappointed that “the little things” the president said got blown out of proportion. “It was a very true statement, but the immaturity of the conversation about race in this country wouldn’t allow that to stand as a simple, true statement,” she said.As valuable as any presidential statement, Ms. Sergew added, was the effect of Mr. Obama’s election in 2008. Cradling her toddler son on Election Day then, “I so distinctly remember holding him and just weeping at the possibility that my son could grow up to just assume this is normal,” she said. “Seeing images of an African-American family that is so dedicated to its members and so full of love and respect is significant for many black families. It’s like Black Camelot.”Still, aspirations are one thing. In Mr. Obama’s second term, more African-Americans will be looking for action.“I think there is overwhelming joy and pride that Barack Obama has been re-elected, but every community wishes for more,” said Roslyn M. Brock, the chairwoman of the board of the N.A.A.C.P. “I am hopeful and prayerful that in his second term, he will get to the social issues that continue to plague us, and leave his legacy, his mark, on them.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/world/asia/political-heir-says-too-few-in-india-hold-political-sway.html,"NEW DELHI — Rahul Gandhi is a member of a family that has led India for most of the nation’s 65-year history, but in one of the most important speeches of his life on Sunday he was deeply critical of the Indian government.“No matter what state you look at, no matter which political party you look at, why do a handful of people control the entire political space?” Mr. Gandhi asked. “Power is grossly centralized in our country.”Indeed, power in India has mostly been centralized in Mr. Gandhi’s family, and his speech on Sunday was his first major step in trying to ensure that this centralization continues well past 2014, when national elections are scheduled. Mr. Gandhi is the son, grandson and great-grandson of previous Indian prime ministers. He and his mother, Sonia Gandhi, president of the Indian National Congress Party, gave speeches on Sunday on the last day of a party meeting in Jaipur.“And it does not matter how much wisdom you have, you mean nothing,” Mr. Gandhi said. “This is the tragedy of India. Why is our youth angry? Why are they out on the street? They are angry because they are alienated. They are excluded from the political class.” Mr. Gandhi said the entire system must be transformed, although he said that the Congress Party had already begun that process.He was formally elevated Saturday to vice president in the governing Congress Party, making him second only to his mother in the party’s hierarchy. His promotion has been years in the making, and many in the party have been quietly pressing him to take a more active role in governing for years. He has never held a cabinet-level position.In her own remarks, Mrs. Gandhi turned to a recent crime that prompted widespread outrage. “The barbaric gang-rape of a young woman in Delhi has shaken the country, she said. “She embodied the spirit of an aspirational India. We will ensure her death will not go in vain.”She promised to press for legislation to ensure that 30 percent of the positions in Parliament and the state legislative assemblies would be held by women. India has a vast system of quotas for the historically disadvantaged, and expanding those set-asides has for years been deeply popular with those who benefit from them — which increasingly is much of the population.Mrs. Gandhi also said that the Congress Party needed to do a better job of explaining its successes, and she lashed out at corruption as “a deep-rooted malice.”“As a party we must lead the struggle to combat its effect,” she said.The Gandhi family has long been the glue that held the Congress Party together even as regional rivals have become more powerful. Sonia Gandhi has mostly carried the Gandhi mantel since her husband, Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, was assassinated. But she is a native of Italy, and when her party won the 2004 elections, she chose a technocrat, Manmohan Singh, to be the government’s prime minister.But Mr. Singh is 80. Few expect him to continue as prime minister past next year, and many in the party have looked to Mr. Gandhi to take up his role as the leader of his family and his party.Whether Mr. Gandhi will thrive in this role is a source of constant speculation. He entered politics in 2004 by taking over a seat in Parliament vacated for him by his mother, who moved to a neighboring constituency. He campaigned aggressively in recent state elections in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar, but his party was soundly defeated in both places. Perhaps wary of another poor performance, he and his mother campaigned sparingly in December during state elections in Gujarat, where the Congress Party was again defeated.It is still unclear whether Mr. Gandhi will be tapped as the party’s pick for prime minister next year. Equally uncertain is who will be the candidate for the Bharatiya Janata Party, the main opposition. Narendra Modi is now that party’s most accomplished leader, but he is deeply unpopular with Muslims because he was in charge in Gujarat when deadly riots erupted there in 2002, leaving nearly 1,000 people dead, many of them Muslims.Mr. Gandhi has led party youth organizations, and Congress Party leaders hope he will be able to appeal to India’s vast youth population. At 42, he is much younger than most of India’s leaders, whose average age is 65."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/opinion/is-a-political-realignment-possible.html,"PROVIDENCE, R.I.BARACK OBAMA has arrived at a historical moment enjoyed by only one other Democratic president since Franklin D. Roosevelt: he gets to deliver a second Inaugural Address.The second inaugurals we remember bear witness to political realignment. The words of Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, in particular, testify to the closing of one era and the opening of another. In 1936 and 1984, Roosevelt and Reagan each won big. Their triumphs consolidated political transformations that had been building for some time and allowed their respective parties to reset the nation’s political center of gravity.Without the benefit of historical distance, how do we judge whether we are in the midst of such a realignment? Are the country’s deepest political instincts undergoing fundamental change? Coming up with an answer is not easy.Roosevelt and Reagan were historical opponents in the 20th century version of our longstanding battle between empowered and limited government. Roosevelt argued that “we have begun to bring private autocratic powers into their proper subordination to the public’s government.” Reagan might as well have been talking to F.D.R. when he countered, “We asked things of government that government was not equipped to give.”Yet to understand the full meaning of their re-election, we have to look closely at what allowed each party to define an era. The Democratic Party dominated the period between 1932 and 1980 with nearly unassailable Congressional majorities. The Republican Party was far more dependent on the executive branch and a few friendly Congresses.The House of Representatives had a Democratic majority every year but four between 1933 and 1995, the Senate every year but four between 1933 and 1981. While the Roosevelt-Truman and Kennedy-Johnson presidencies were instrumental in developing Democratic liberalism, it was Congressional Democratic strength that defined the era and boxed in Eisenhower and Nixon.That Republicans have rarely enjoyed such unassailable majorities helps us understand recent history. Each generation of Republican strategists announced the emergence of a new Republican majority, beginning with Kevin Phillips in 1969 and continuing on through Lee Atwater, the Contract With America, Karl Rove and the Tea Party.This is precisely why contemporary Republicans worry about Mr. Obama, and it partly explains Republican Congressional behavior since 1994. Despite their success in shifting the nation’s politics rightward since 1980, Republicans have not been able to lock in the kind of year in, year out majorities the Democrats once enjoyed.As the rage of the culture wars loses its political purchase, demographic trends have further deepened Republican anxiety. Postelection polls revealed what party insiders already knew: they lead a largely white party that skews older and more toward the middle and upper classes. Republicanism — as many insiders admit — is on an unsustainable path. Mr. Obama once said that Reagan “changed the trajectory of America” because he “tapped into what people were already feeling.” Could Mr. Obama do the same and orchestrate a quiet realignment with shifting demographics on his side?Despite the fact that we’re much closer to national health insurance, many liberals find this idea laughable. They see Mr. Obama as an even more committed centrist than Bill Clinton and they are convinced, with some justification, that they no longer really have a national party. They see a Democratic Party controlled by its corporate center and a Republican Party controlled by its right wing. The man who looked like an avatar of realignment in 2008 appears to many liberals in 2013 as a passive compromiser.Their view is understandable. The de facto 60-vote supermajority now effectively required in the Senate, the gerrymandering of Congressional districts for Republican advantage, the Supreme Court’s rightward lurch, the post-Citizens United deluge of money and the long assault on organized labor would seem to make a new liberal political alignment exceedingly unlikely.A directionless politics prevails instead. At the national level, there is no political will to address long-term problems like soaring health care costs, climate change, infrastructure decay and prison overpopulation.Meanwhile, states like Michigan have further eroded labor and reproductive rights, while others, like California, with its Democratic supermajority, seem poised to safeguard the same while increasing spending. As the left-wing political activist Michael Harrington said in 1976, the country is “moving vigorously left, right and center, all at once.”The historian Matthew D. Lassiter has called this the politics of the “volatile center.” Rather than a leftward or rightward realignment, we may be in for decades of furious contests not just for voters in the middle but over middling political ideas.Which brings us back to Mr. Obama. In the long shadow of the New Deal and the Reagan Revolution, the marathon debates over whether the top marginal income-tax rate should be 35 or 39.6 percent seem unworthy of his predecessors’ larger visions. But presidents don’t realign American politics; they consolidate realignments whose complex sources lie elsewhere.This is Mr. Obama’s real problem. Taken together, his health care reform and his cautious rejection of most of the policies of George W. Bush may well be judged by future historians as a meaningful adjustment. But there is insufficient clarity in the political landscape for him to articulate a new political calculus of the sort devised by Roosevelt and Reagan. The president’s voice is simply one more in the raucous cacophony that currently defines our public square."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/world/europe/a-nail-biter-for-merkel-in-german-state-election.html,"BERLIN — The outcome of a regional election in the state of Lower Saxony remained a neck-and-neck battle between Chancellor Angela Merkel’s party and its main rivals that was too close to call Sunday night, according to projections made hours after the polls closed.Projections from the country’s two public television stations, based on exit polls and a partial count of ballots, showed the chancellor’s party, the Christian Democrats, winning a little more than 36 percent of the vote for a new state legislature.The opposition Social Democrats and Greens, who hope to oust Ms. Merkel’s party from the regional government, picked up about 32.5 and 13.5 percent, respectively.Should those numbers hold, the two television stations, ARD and ZDF, projected, Ms. Merkel’s coalition in the region would be able to pull off a majority in the state legislature in Hanover with a majority of a single seat.But the clear winners appeared to be the Free Democrats, the junior partner in Ms. Merkel’s governing coalition in Berlin, which projections showed earned nearly 10 percent of the vote, or well beyond the necessary 5 percent needed to secure representation in the regional legislature.Neither the Pirate party nor the Left party were able to clear that hurdle in Lower Saxony, meaning they will not be represented in the legislature.If the Christian Democrats emerge as the strongest party when the final votes are counted, they are expected to build a government with the Free Democrats, returning the same constellation to power that has governed the state since 2008.A relatively robust economy, low unemployment and the chancellor’s hard-nosed handling of Europe’s debt crisis, which made her the focus of criticism and protest in many of Europe’s weaker member countries, has been well received at home, helping to boost her party’s popularity nationally.That appeared to have carried over to Lower Saxony’s election, which heated up in recent weeks at it became a swing state, with the Christian Democrats clawing their way back from lows in September when they trailed the Social Democrats by 13 percentage points. Ms. Merkel made seven appearances in Lower Saxony this month, alongside the state’s governor, David McAllister.Although he was the incumbent, the campaign was the first for Mr. McAllister, 42, who took over the position in 2010 when his predecessor, Christian Wulff, was called to Berlin to become president. The son of a soldier from Scotland and a German mother, Mr. McAllister insisted throughout the campaign that his tenure had brought prosperity to the region, and he urged voters to support continuity.His main challenger, the mayor of Hanover, Stephan Weil, who ran for the Social Democrats, struggled to make himself better known among voters, resorting at one point in the campaign to handing out red roses to prospective voters in the largely rural state, which stretches across largely rural countryside from the North Sea to the former inner-German border.Mr. Weil also sought to turn out the vote, appealing early Sunday to those still undecided to cast their ballots. “Otherwise you are just letting the others decide your future for you,” Mr. Weil told reporters while casting his own vote in Hanover.Although local issues tend to dominate regional elections — as was the case in Lower Saxony, where the education system and completion of several infrastructure projects dominated the debate — the outcome could help the Free Democrats improve their image at the national level of a party dogged by a leadership crisis.Many had blamed the party’s chairman, Philipp Rösler, who also serves as economy minister and consistently ranks among the country’s least-popular politicians, for failing to focus on concrete issues.The Social Democrats have also suffered at the national level after a series of blunders by their main candidate for chancellor, Peer Steinbrück. In recent weeks Mr. Steinbrück, the former finance minister from Ms. Merkel’s first government, has seen his image — as a can-do man intent on protecting average Germans’ savings — sullied by an attempt to defend his €1.25 million, or about $1.65 million, in earnings from the lecture circuit and a series of gaffes that has included saying that Ms. Merkel benefits from a “women’s bonus.”Regardless of the outcome in Lower Saxony, the Social Democrats have insisted that they will stick with Mr. Steinbrück as their main candidate for the national vote, which is scheduled for September."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/many-of-obamas-longstanding-advisers-moving-on.html,"WASHINGTON — When President Obama offered a tongue-in-cheek lament last week that he was “getting kind of lonely in this big house,” he was referring to his two daughters, who he said were less eager to hang out with their dad as they grew older.But Mr. Obama might just as well have been talking about the fraternity of middle-aged political advisers who have been at his side since before the 2008 campaign and who are finally moving on. Exhausted and eager for new careers, they nevertheless plan to create an ad hoc support group for the boss they are leaving behind.“It’s something we’ve thought about a lot,” said David Axelrod, one of Mr. Obama’s most trusted political aides, who returned to the Obama fold to advise on the re-election campaign and is now off to start an institute for politics at the University of Chicago. “Presidents need to have people with longstanding relationships around them,” he said, “because the instinct most people have with the president is to be deferential to a fault.”For the first time since Mr. Obama became president, none of his Big Three political counselors — Mr. Axelrod, David Plouffe and Robert Gibbs — will be working in the White House. Now they are in the top rank of Obama alumni, a status that confers benefits of its own.Mr. Obama still has trusted aides around him, including Valerie Jarrett, a family friend from Chicago; Denis R. McDonough, a veteran of 2008, who is moving up to chief of staff; and Alyssa Mastromonaco and Pete Rouse, two of his longest-serving staff members. “We’re strategically spaced out,” said Benjamin J. Rhodes, who wrote foreign-policy speeches in 2008 and is a deputy national security adviser.But reaching some of his oldest and closest confidants will now require a phone call, rather than simply a knock on their West Wing office doors. And that is where Anita Decker Breckenridge comes in.Ms. Decker Breckenridge, 34, sits a few steps outside the Oval Office and is a master of the Obama Rolodex. She ran his downstate Illinois office when he was in the United States Senate. Her only moment in the limelight came when the White House confirmed that she, like Warren Buffett’s secretary, paid a higher tax rate in 2011 than her boss.That year, Mr. Obama asked Ms. Decker Breckenridge to be his personal aide, a position that doubles as his gatekeeper. She met Mr. Obama nearly a decade ago and knows instinctively whom he does, and does not, want to hear from.“Loyalty and trust mean everything,” she said in a weekend interview. “He is someone who has always valued long and old friendships.”And she can find any of his old friends on short notice, particularly in the late-night hours when he likes to talk on the phone.“We know the deal when he needs us and when he asks us to get involved,” said Mr. Gibbs, his first White House press secretary. “And that is, ‘Yes, sir.’ ”For all the chatter about whether the president socializes enough in Washington, friends know that he has always been something of a loner. And yet he does not always like to be alone.During long rides on Air Force One, including his solitary flights to and from Hawaii over the holidays, he was busy rounding up players for one of his favorite pastimes: a game of spades.His most frequent partners are Marvin Nicholson, the trip director; Pete Souza, the chief White House photographer; and Jay Carney, the press secretary. All three are remaining in their positions, eliminating the need for Mr. Obama to find new tablemates.Though much of the president’s political inner circle has dispersed, they are bound together by the latest iteration of the Obama campaign organization: Organizing for Action.Jim Messina, who managed the president’s re-election bid, will be the chairman of the group, which includes Mr. Gibbs and Mr. Plouffe, who managed the 2008 campaign.Not clear yet is whether Mr. Messina will hold weekly dinners at which the alumni can dispense advice to those inside the White House. Mr. Axelrod had dinners, featuring pizza and Thai food, when he was senior political adviser from 2009 to 2011.Mr. Plouffe, who has been in the White House since 2011, is leaving this week to return to the private sector, where he has been a consultant and a public speaker. Even with the bruising battles over fiscal policy, gun control and immigration ahead, he said, he did not entertain the idea of sticking around.“Getting fresh voices is good,” Mr. Plouffe said.Reducing a president’s reliance on insiders can have unpredictable consequences for a second term, both good and bad, according to the presidential historian Michael Beschloss.Dwight D. Eisenhower flourished after Sherman Adams, his overly protective chief of staff, left in 1958. But Ronald Reagan stumbled after James A. Baker III, his trusted chief of staff, was replaced by Donald Regan, a Wall Street banker whom he barely knew.To the extent that Mr. Obama’s advisers worry about such things, their concern is having people who are willing to tell the president when they think he is wrong. Even those who have known him a long time, his aides acknowledge, sometimes hesitate to do that.“Will it be a great strategic and political loss without Axe and Plouffe? I hope not,” said Dan Pfeiffer, the communications director, who is also a veteran of 2008 and plans to stay on. “But will the nature and character of this place change? That’s probably true.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/world/middleeast/as-elections-near-protesters-in-jordan-increasingly-turn-anger-toward-the-king.html,"AMMAN, Jordan — For two years, protests demanding reform here have seethed, fueled by complaints about corruption, incompetent governing and the slow pace of change. In November, deadly demonstrations against a cut in fuel subsidies spread throughout the country.The widening anger has brought together longtime political opposition figures with those who were once a part of the monarchy’s loyal base. The focus of the protests has also started to broaden, from anger at corrupt officials to bolder expressions of dissatisfaction with King Abdullah II.To quiet his critics, the king is relying on a new round of parliamentary elections scheduled for Wednesday, a contest that he has promised “will breathe life into our democracy.”The vote comes as Jordan copes with a number of domestic challenges, including a crushing deficit and a flood of more than 200,000 Syrian refugees — the kinds of crises that have often derailed movements for reform.However, while the opposition has often seemed more conservative in Jordan than elsewhere in the region — calling for reform rather than the overthrow of the government — it is has shown no sign of easing pressure on the king.The disillusionment that has fueled the protests is concentrated in the southern city of Ma’an, known for uprisings and phosphate mines.In the center of town this week, a group of men who had occupied a traffic circle to protest the region’s lack of jobs ate lunch in a tent. Some said they had worked as smugglers, but even that trade had dried up.“We want to live,” proclaimed graffiti on a sculpture. Beyond it the charred remains of the governor’s residence was visible, set on fire during a recent protest.The parliamentary campaign in Ma’an has focused on local issues — like winning the region its share of the spoils from the mines — and on the corruption that has become a rallying cry for dissent across the country.“They don’t see anything from the precious mines,” said Abdul-Karim al-Bahri al-Muhameed, a former civil servant who is running with the support of his tribe. “The king is not serious about getting the money stolen by corruption,” he said.He sat in the salon of a tribal leader, Sheik Adel al-Muhameed, a supporter of his candidacy who was boycotting the vote. “I don’t trust the Parliament,” he said.During the last two years, the government had approached tribal leaders like him to try and stop the street protests, Mr. Muhameed said. “The government cannot handle it,” he said. The election, he added, “is a play.”Citing a history of rigged elections in Jordan that have produced toothless legislatures, many government critics have dismissed Wednesday’s polling as a cosmetic and desperate effort by an absolute monarch to avoid handing over power. A few opposition groups, including the largest, the Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood, and the protest network known as Hirak are boycotting the vote.“He doesn’t carry out of any of his promises,” said Nimer al-Assaf, the deputy general secretary of the Islamic Action Front, the Brotherhood’s political party. Mr. Assaf predicted that no more than 25 percent of registered voters would turn up at the polls. “People are rejecting the whole idea,” he said.But other opposition groups are participating in the election, stirring new divides.Other candidates, to be sure, have put aside their misgivings in the hope that freedom will gradually emerge.“Democracy happens in degrees,” said Mohamed al-Hajouj, a Palestinian refugee who is running for Parliament, undeterred by gerrymandered districts that continue to underrepresent the country’s citizens of Palestinian origin, a majority.Something had to be done, Mr. Hajouj reckoned, likening Jordan to a grenade ready to explode. The elections, he said, would keep it from blowing up.Jordanian officials say they have added a number of election safeguards to prevent what was seen as a process manipulated by the country’s powerful intelligence services and marred by vote-buying and other fraud.International and local observers say they have been promised full access to polling stations. In recent days, the authorities have announced investigations into several prominent candidates, including former members of Parliament, on charges of bribery.In a kind of position paper the king released last Wednesday, he offered his people a civics lesson, discussing the mores of active citizens — including writing letters to the editors of newspapers — and pleaded for compromise in the public discourse.“To make democracy work,” the king wrote, “it is critical that we debate, discuss and vote on the basis of the positions put forward by the candidates on key issues facing our country, and not the basis of personalities or affinities related to geography or family.”Among the king’s critics, the effort was ignored or dismissed as a public relations exercise for the benefit of allies like the United States that need to justify their support for him. The system criticized by the king was in fact perpetuated by him, his critics charged. And opposition leaders claimed they already had seen evidence of fraud.Mr. Assaf, of the Islamic Action Front, said a former government official, whom he refused to name, had offered the party parliamentary seats in return for cooperation with the election. Leaders of another protest movement said intermediaries for the government had approached them with a similar offer.In any case, the claims — along with accusations of staggering corruption and the cheap sale of public land — foster mistrust of Jordan’s rulers that seems unlikely to vanish with the election. The Brotherhood and leaders of Hirak vowed to keep pressing their claims in the streets.At a campaign tent in the town of Shobak, near Ma’an, a former member of Parliament, Wasfi Rawashdeh, had come to support a candidate in Wednesday’s vote. A lawmaker with a reputation as principled and tough on corruption, Mr. Rawashdeh said that in his experience it was nearly impossible for the legislature — dominated by government loyalists, as it is and is likely to remain — to be effective.“We made a difference, but not like we hoped,” he said. “There is pressure on the parliamentarians. No one likes me, from the king on down.”Mr. Rawashdeh said that Jordan’s rulers still considered democracy an option, not a necessity — something “to show the world.” The king, he said, was not hearing the complaints in Ma’an and elsewhere. “He buys time,” he added, “and it’s not good for the country.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/from-dawns-early-light-a-day-filled-with-pomp-and-exuberance.html,"WASHINGTON — The second time around is never as exhilarating as the first, but to President Obama’s most ardent supporters this year brought its own kind of magic.There were crowds and congestion, but the mood around town on Monday — from the streets to the bars to the parties to the hotels to the Mall to the monuments — was exuberant and, compared with 2009, relaxed.“It’s a lot more laid-back,” said Kerwin Miller, a Washington lawyer who was at a brunch for the Martin Luther King Jr. Foundation at the Hay Adams Hotel. “People are excited, clearly. But it’s not a frenzied kind of excitement.”Here, a minute-by-minute diary of the celebration.6:28 a.m.Sunrise at the MemorialAs the sun peeked across the Tidal Basin in brilliant oranges and pinks, a handful of people gazed up in the cold at the memorial of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “It’s not a novelty this time,” said Holly Wieland, 57, of Reston, Va., who attended President Obama’s first inauguration. “It’s like the first time you say, ‘Maybe it’s an aberration.’ But it’s for real now.”Marquita Payne, 30, came from Lynchburg, Va., with her 9-year-old daughter, who took photos a few yards away. Ms. Payne talked about why she and her daughter braved the 30-degree temperatures to see the memorial before sunrise. “He’s big,” she said, admiring the statue. “He stands for everything that’s going on now.”8:45 a.m.Gone Fishin’Aboard the Coast Guard cutter Chock on the Potomac River, a call crackled over the radio: A small craft had been spotted in a restricted area near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Within minutes a Coast Guard fast boat with a large automatic weapon mounted to the bow raced to interdict.“We fight against complacency,” said Brian Kuhar, the chief petty officer of the Chock, a 65-foot small harbor tug, as he listened in on the radio conversation between the dispatcher and the fast boat. “Anything moving on the water right now doesn’t have a purpose to be here.”Washington was heavily fortified on Monday, including its cold, gray waterways. Several dozen boats from the Coast Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Washington Metro Police patrolled the Potomac shoreline, looking for suspicious craft among the driftwood and scudding ducks.The radio crackled again with an update from the fast boat’s crew: “The vessel is in the creek stopped, appears to be fishing.”9:11 a.m.Silence in Section 60Huge throngs were assembling on the National Mall, but Arlington National Cemetery, normally packed with visitors, was deserted. A cold wind blew the handmade Christmas decorations on the graves in Section 60, where the war dead from Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. Many tombstones have birthdates in the 1980s.“With everything going on, it’s something you would expect,” Greg Veney, who works at the cemetery’s welcome center, said of the absence of crowds. “We think maybe after everything is over they’ll make their way here.”9:17 a.m.Lost LuggageOn the Washington Metro from Farragut North to Judiciary Square, Faye and Earl Sadberry were wondering what to wear to one of the inaugural balls. It wasn’t fashion indecision: Their airline had lost their luggage, including Mr. Sadberry’s tuxedo and Mrs. Sadberry’s ball gown.“I heard Macy’s is open later today,” Mr. Sadberry said. “We’re not giving up just yet.”10:37 a.m.Marnie at the CapitolSitting in a black folding chair front and center at the foot of the Capitol, Allison Williams — the daughter of Brian Williams, the “NBC Nightly News” anchor, and perhaps now best known for playing the character Marnie on the HBO show “Girls” — chatted with fans and posed for pictures.She also took a minute to ponder a question she called “impossible to answer:” Which is more exciting, today’s inaugural festivities or the recent Golden Globe victory for “Girls”?“They’re such different kinds of excitement,” she said. “This is a national and international and historic kind of excitement. And while I feel our show winning was momentous, it was personal for our little family, and this is something I’m sharing with half a million of my best friends.”Over all, celebrities were sparse compared with 2009. But a number turned up, including Katy Perry, John Mayer, John Legend, Beyoncé, Jay-Z and James Taylor.11:15 a.m.We Are StuckCrammed into the nonticketed area and not moving any closer long before the ceremony began, people stood shifting weight from one foot to the other on the National Mall, with little else to do but watch the comings and goings of honored guests on the Jumbotrons.For the most recognizable faces, there were cheers — and boos, reflecting the unpopularity of Congressional Republicans with this crowd.Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Newt Gingrich elicited waves of disapproving sounds. Scattered boos for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, prompted a few to turn to their friends and ask, “Who’s that?”Patty Williamson, 38, of Pasadena, Calif., volunteered for Mr. Obama’s campaign twice. As her 3-year-old daughter climbed around in her stroller, Ms. Williamson said maneuvering the crowds with a young child hadn’t been too hard to manage so far. But the sight of so many knees seemed to be getting to her daughter.“Are we stuck, Daddy?” she asked, looking up at her father as she turned around in her seat.“Yes, we are,” he said.11:30 a.m.HatsHat check from Section 3 of the inaugural platform: Four mink toppers, eight Tuskegee Airmen caps, a plaid beret and 12 white Coast Guard covers with, according to their wearers, distinctly uncomfortable bills.11:40 a.m.The Producer RelaxesGeorge Stevens Jr., who was the executive producer of the 2009 inaugural concert at the Lincoln Memorial — the one with Bruce Springsteen, Bono, Renée Fleming, Beyoncé, Garth Brooks, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder and Mary J. Blige, just to name a few — was having a far more relaxed experience this time around.“It’s just a different pleasure,” he said, dressed in a peach crew-neck sweater as he held a cup of hot chocolate at the Motion Picture Association of America on I Street, where guests watched the inaugural festivities on television in the warm confines of the association’s screening room. “We had friends over last night and it was great fun. We had a huge inaugural before, so this is lower-key. I think the scale of this is just right.”NoonFlashes, Applause, QuietAs Mr. Obama took to the podium, a sea of cellphone lights, like so many fireflies, lit up from the steps of the Capitol to the Washington Monument. Mr. Obama’s references to Stonewall, gay marriage and pay equality sparked fast and loud bursts of applause, but when his words turned to Newtown, Conn., there was only quiet, enough to hear a slight wind rustle through the trees.12:15 p.m.An Old Rival ApplaudsSenator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who ran for president against Mr. Obama in 2008 and lost, was an interesting study in Inaugural Address applause. A longtime skeptic of overturning the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” rule, Mr. McCain clapped when the president declared, “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.”When Mr. Obama said that climate change must be confronted, Mr. McCain also applauded, even as several Republicans seated on the platform did not join him.After the remarks, Mr. McCain said that he wished the president would have pledged to work with Republicans, but he bluntly acknowledged, as he knows firsthand, that elections have consequences.“The president has high favorability ratings and Republicans have very low favorability ratings,” Mr. McCain said. “So he’s succeeding as far as the P.R. side of it is concerned.”1:48 p.m.Lunch at LastThe inaugural luncheon was a splendor of orange (the centerpieces, not the complexions) and odd pairings (not the New England lobster and South Dakota bison, but the seating arrangement).Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican whip, got the draw many others obviously wanted. He sat next to former President Bill Clinton, who had to greet virtually everyone in attendance. The other former president at the lunch, Jimmy Carter, was seated next to Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. Rosalynn Carter drew Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the taciturn Republican leader.Timothy F. Geithner, the departing Treasury secretary, was seated with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, expected to soon be secretary of state. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, got plenty of time to talk over impending military cuts at the table of Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.In keeping with the inaugural theme of equality, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chairman of the inaugural committee, lamented that only one woman was immortalized with a statue in the hall: Frances Willard, a suffragist and 19th-century social reformer. But he delivered news that another female face would soon be joining the assembled statuary.“Rosa Parks completes her journey from the back of the bus to the front of Statuary Hall later this year,” Mr. Schumer said.2:20 p.m.PedicabsNew York has a lot of things that Washington lacks, like good bagels, tabloid newspapers, skyscrapers — and pedicabs. So late last week, Gordon Gertsen, 32, loaded his bike onto a truck and headed to Washington, where he had heard that pedicab drivers who made a similar trip in 2009 made of lot of money on Mr. Obama’s first inauguration.He was startled by what he found.“New York is pretty dirty,” he said. “I was really surprised by how clean it was here. It’s hillier and more difficult to ride.” He added: “My legs are much more sore.”There was another challenge in navigating Washington’s circles and squares and places like K Street. “At first it was complicated to get around the Mall, how to get through the alphabets, the monuments, the hotels; a lot of people wanted to be taken to the subway,” he said.In the end, his balance sheet wasn’t inspiring. Friday and Saturday were not very profitable, he said, although business picked up on Sunday, when he made about $700. “I probably did a little better than break even,” he said.3 p.m.Empty Bar StoolsPerhaps it was the afternoon sunshine or simply the case that a second act is not as big of a draw as the first, but the city’s hot spots were not nearly as bustling as they were during Mr. Obama’s first inauguration.The fireplace was crackling at Adour, the fashionable bar at the St. Regis, but getting a table was a cinch. Sitting just two blocks from the White House, the pace at the St. Regis — the hotel of choice for the president’s most prolific fund-raisers — was far slower than in 2009. “Four years ago, people were packed in here,” a server said. “You couldn’t see across the lobby. Where is everyone?”The weather was far more seasonable this time, which seemed to draw more people to the parade route along Pennsylvania Avenue. But that wasn’t the only explanation: Fewer campaign contributors made the trip to Washington, several donors said, not out of a lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Obama’s second term, but more out of a reluctance to deal with the hassles of a trip. The California contingent, for example, was significantly smaller than four years ago.4 p.m.DronesAs the crowds left the inaugural ceremony, protesters a few blocks from the Capitol held large pictures of children they said were killed in drone attacks. “King had a dream,” one of them yelled. “Obama has a drone.”8:30 p.m.Making the CurveAs the temperatures dropped, partygoers gasped as they encountered a line snaking around the block to get into the two inaugural balls at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. Some argued with volunteers, claiming others had cut ahead, but many stuck it out, bracing against an icy wind in little more than their gowns and tuxedos. This late into the inaugural day, they could only celebrate the little victories.As one woman exulted as she progressed through the line, “We made the curve!”The night had just begun."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/world/europe/center-left-defeats-merkels-party-in-state-vote.html,"BERLIN — Chancellor Angela Merkel is without question the most powerful politician in Europe, trusted by German voters with their money and their future, but that still may not be enough to secure her a third term in elections this year.A down-to-the-wire state election over the weekend has shaken up German politics, handing the upper house of Parliament squarely to the opposition and jeopardizing Ms. Merkel’s re-election chances in September.Speaking to reporters after meeting with her Christian Democratic party leaders, the chancellor did not try to play down the outcome of Sunday’s vote in the state of Lower Saxony. “I don’t want to beat around the bush — after such an emotional roller coaster, a loss hurts all the more,” said Ms. Merkel, standing beside her party’s lead candidate from the state, a visibly shellshocked David McAllister, who had led the polls for months.The Social Democrats and Greens were poised to take power in the state after winning a one-seat majority in the state Parliament, ending a decade of conservative control. Once again it was the relative weakness of Ms. Merkel’s coalition partners, the Free Democrats, that decided the election.The Social Democrats took 32.6 percent of ballots, while the Greens won 13.7 percent, official preliminary results showed Monday, giving them 69 seats in the state legislature. Although the Christian Democrats emerged as the strongest party, with 36 percent of the vote, combined with their Free Democrat partners they were able to secure only 68 seats.The Christian Democrats were so concerned about the smaller party’s chances that their leaders implored their own voters to split their votes with the struggling party. In elections in most German states, each voter casts two votes, one for an individual candidate and the other for a party.The tactic nearly worked. The Free Democrats, polling right around the 5 percent threshold for representation in the state Parliament, won 9.9 percent of the vote. Analysis showed that more than 100,000 voters from the Christian Democrats shared their votes with the Free Democrats.Ms. Merkel can only hope that the Free Democrats put their house in order before parliamentary elections in eight months. Indeed, analysts interpreted the results as a worrying omen for Ms. Merkel as she squares off against her main challenger for chancellor, Peer Steinbrück of the Social Democrats. Though he kicked off his campaign with a series of gaffes and trails far behind Ms. Merkel, voters will not be choosing one over the other.Germany does not have a two-party, winner-take-all system; parliamentary politics come down to party success and alliances. The chances that Ms. Merkel’s Christian Democrats will win an outright majority in September’s elections are extremely low, polls show.That means that Ms. Merkel needs the Free Democrats to pull out of their tailspin. Otherwise, she could see a national repeat of the result in Lower Saxony, where her party won the largest share of the vote but watched the Social Democrats and the Greens team up to take power.Avoiding such an outcome will not be easy. Ms. Merkel is renowned for her tactical maneuvering but often criticized for succeeding at the expense of her associates and subordinates. Opinion surveys consistently show that she is more popular than ever, with voters particularly approving of her tough stance in the euro crisis on bailouts for deeply indebted nations like Greece. But analysts have questioned whether the Christian Democrats have therefore become too much of a one-woman party — and perhaps have jeopardized the junior partners in the governing coalition by overshadowing them.Philipp Rösler, the head of the pro-business Free Democrats and Ms. Merkel’s vice chancellor, responded Monday to the Lower Saxony defeat by offering to step down as party chairman. The leadership decided that he would remain but not lead the party in the parliamentary elections, making Mr. Rösler in effect a lame duck.Complicating matters further, the left-leaning coalition now enjoys an outright majority in Parliament’s upper house, the Bundesrat, where state delegations vote on legislation. The Social Democrats and Greens can now reject bills that need the upper house’s approval, forcing their return to the lower house for more debate.Although the shift of power is not expected to affect the government’s handling of the euro crisis, it could provide opportunities for the opposition to drag out other issues, resulting in an extended period of gridlock that could damage the governing coalition’s public standing.Ms. Merkel made it clear that the Free Democrats remain her preferred partner, but that she would not rule out a return to her coalition from 2005 to 2009, in which her Christian Democrats governed with the Social Democrats.“It will be a national election in which every party fights for its own votes,” Ms. Merkel said.The result in Lower Saxony continued a trend of losing state elections for the Christian Democrats in important states where they once held clear majorities.In May, the Christian Democrats failed to take control of Germany’s most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, where the Social Democrats and Greens consolidated control, and they lost Schleswig-Holstein.A year earlier, they had been forced to step down after 58 years at the helm in Baden-Württemberg.Although the Christian Democrats fared much better in Lower Saxony than in those states, as Jürgen Falter, a professor of political science at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, pointed out, it set a dangerous precedent for what could happen in September.“The result showed that the conservative camp can rack up a considerable result, but that may still not be enough to build a coalition,” he said."

We cannot claim special control of the canal on the ground that we own the canal zone. It is not our territory, except in trust.”1938 Hitler Orders New City BuiltBERLIN —  Adolf Hitler, it was disclosed today [Jan. 21], has decreed the erection, forty-five minutes from Berlin, of an entirely new city to house the workers at the huge plant which is projected for the production of the “volkswagen,” or people’s car. The population of the city is expected to be 60,000. Under a slogan equivalent to that of “Own your own car,” the Führer hopes through the “volkswagen” to revolutionize the automobile industry of Germany and perhaps Europe, somewhat as Henry Ford with his model T revolutionized that of the United States. Herr Hitler’s dream is to produce a small, strongly-built automobile so inexpensive that large numbers of Germans and other Europeans who are now carless can indulge in four-wheeled motoring.1963 Plan To End Border Dispute NEW DELHI —  Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru put before Parliament today [Jan. 21] neutralist proposals to end the Sino-Indian border dispute. Mr. Nehru made no recommendation to Parliament to accept or reject the proposals which were drawn up by six neutral nations at a conference in Colombo last month. The Prime Minister said that the proposals are only meant to prepare for talks between India and Communist China. In a broadcast monitored in Tokyo today, Peking radio reported that Chinese Foreign Minister Chen Yi said China accepted the proposals “in principle” but “reserved some interpretation” on them. In the proposals, the neutrals suggested China should withdraw its troops 12 and a half miles in Ladakh but that India should not reoccupy the area."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/a-chance-for-the-senate-to-fix-the-filibuster.html,"For six years, Democrats in the Senate have chafed at an unprecedented abuse of the filibuster by Republicans, who have used the practice to hold up nominees high and low and require a supermajority for virtually every bill. But now that they finally have an opportunity to end much of this delay and abuse, Democrats are instead considering only a few half-measures.When the Senate returns on Tuesday, it will still technically be in the first legislative day of the session, which means only a simple majority is necessary to change the rules for the rest of the session.With the support of 51 senators, the rules could be changed to require a “talking filibuster,” forcing those objecting to a bill to stand and explain their reasons, at length. The current practice of routinely requiring a 60-vote majority for a bill through a silent objection would end, breaking the logjam that has made the chamber a well of inefficiency and frustration.Several younger senators, led by Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Tom Udall of New Mexico, say that if pressed, a majority of the Senate would support their plan for the talking filibuster. But older senators aren’t so sure, and have reportedly persuaded Harry Reid, the majority leader, to back off the idea. With the experience of having been in the minority themselves, these Democrats are fearful of losing a powerful tool should Republicans ever return to power in the chamber.That would squander a moment for change. Supermajorities were never intended to be a routine legislative barrier; they should be reserved for the most momentous bills, and the best way to make that happen is to require that objectors work hard for their filibuster, assembling a like-minded coalition and being forthright about their concerns rather than hiding in the shadows or holding up a bill with an e-mailed note.Currently there are six opportunities to filibuster most bills, and Republicans have exploited them all. Mr. Reid wants to reduce those opportunities and speed things up, primarily by ending the filibuster on motions to proceed to debate on bills.That change alone could a cut a week of delay on most measures. He also wants to curb filibusters that prevent conference committees from meeting and that hold up some presidential nominations.A faster-moving Senate would be useful, but that should not be the only goal. The best way to end the Senate’s sorry history of inaction is to end the silent filibuster, forcing lawmakers to explain themselves if they want to block legislation supported by the majority."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/gov-cuomos-megabucks.html,"If New Yorkers need another good reason to support a major cleanup of their state’s scandalously lax campaign finance laws, they need only look at the latest filing from Gov. Andrew Cuomo.Mr. Cuomo has been talking about reforming the state’s campaign financing system for years, most recently in his State of the State speech this month. But that has not slowed his stunningly intense use of loopholes that allow special interests to lard his campaign with thousands of dollars and make small donors more irrelevant.With a re-election campaign more than a year away, Mr. Cuomo has $22.5 million on hand. Over the last two years, only 1 percent of what the campaign raised came from contributors giving less than $1,000.Small donors were swamped by big givers, according to an analysis of Cuomo campaign filings by New York Public Interest Research Group. Since 2010, 142 people or organizations have given $8.4 million in chunks of $40,000 or more to that campaign. One real estate developer, Leonard Litwin, has given the governor $500,000, according to the research group. The normal limits for contributions are already high: $60,800 per donor per statewide race. But Mr. Litwin and others can give more by creating a number of limited-liability companies that each dole out the maximum allowed. It’s legal, but that is the problem in Albany. The financing laws are loose and badly enforced, just as many Albany lawmakers prefer.Mr. Cuomo has said that he supports a statewide version of New York City’s public financing of campaigns. “It works well in New York City,” he said recently. “It will work well in New York State.” That’s absolutely correct, but Mr. Cuomo has to push for it, just as he pushed for same-sex marriage and gun control and on-time, balanced budgets.New York’s powerful governor cannot simply give speeches about the unfairness of his state’s campaign financing laws while he uses its loopholes to enrich his own campaign. It is time for him to make good on those promises and bring cleaner, fairer and more open campaign financing to Albany."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/climate-change-prominent-in-obamas-inaugural-address.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama made addressing climate change the most prominent policy vow of his second Inaugural Address, setting in motion what Democrats say will be a deliberately paced but aggressive campaign built around the use of his executive powers to sidestep Congressional opposition.“We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,” Mr. Obama said on Monday at the start of eight sentences on the subject, more than he devoted to any other specific area. “Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.”The central place he gave to the subject seemed to answer the question of whether he considered it a realistic second-term priority. He devoted scant attention to it in the campaign and has delivered a mixed message about its importance since the election.Mr. Obama is heading into the effort having extensively studied the lessons from his first term, when he failed to win passage of comprehensive legislation to reduce emissions of the gases that cause global warming. This time, the White House plans to avoid such a fight and instead focus on what it can do administratively to reduce emissions from power plants, increase the efficiency of home appliances and have the federal government itself produce less carbon pollution.Mr. Obama’s path on global warming is a case study in his evolving sense of the limits of his power and his increased willingness to work around intense conservative opposition rather than seek compromise. After coming to office four years ago on a pledge to heal the planet and turn back the rise of the seas, he is proceeding cautiously this time, Democrats said, intent on making sure his approach is vetted politically, economically and technologically so as not to risk missing what many environmental advocates say could be the last best chance for years to address the problem.The centerpiece will be action by the Environmental Protection Agency to clamp down further on emissions from coal-burning power plants under regulations still being drafted — and likely to draw legal challenges.The administration plans to supplement that step by adopting new energy efficiency standards for home appliances and buildings, a seemingly small advance that can have a substantial impact by reducing demand for electricity. Those standards would echo the sharp increase in fuel economy that the administration required from automakers in the first term.The Pentagon, one of the country’s largest energy users, is also taking strides toward cutting use and converting to renewable fuels.Mr. Obama’s aides are planning those steps in conjunction with a campaign to build public support and head off political opposition in a way the administration did not the last time around. But the White House has cautioned activists not to expect full-scale engagement while Congress remains occupied by guns, immigration and the budget.The president’s emphasis on climate change drew fire from conservatives. Tim Phillips, president of Americans for Prosperity, a group financed by the Koch brothers, who made a fortune in refining and other oil interests, criticized the speech in a statement. “His address read like a liberal laundry list with global warming at the top,” Mr. Phillips said. “Americans have rejected environmental extremism in the past and they will again.”Still, Mr. Obama has signaled that he intends to expand his own role in making a public case for why action is necessary and why, despite the conservative argument that such changes would cost jobs and leave the United States less competitive with rising powers like China, they could have economic benefits by promoting a clean-energy industry. In addition to the prominent mention on Monday, Mr. Obama also used strong language in his speech on election night, referring to “the destructive power of a warming planet.”Those remarks stood in contrast to Mr. Obama’s comments at his first postelection news conference, when he said he planned to convene “a wide-ranging conversation” about climate change and was vague about action. He is also expected to highlight his plans in his State of the Union address next month and in his budget plan soon afterward.Beyond new policies, the administration is seeking to capitalize on the surge of natural gas production over the past few years. As a cheaper and cleaner alternative to coal, natural gas gives it a chance to argue that coal is less economically attractive.After the defeat in 2010 of legislation that would have capped carbon emissions and issued tradable permits for emissions, Mr. Obama turned to regulation and financing for alternative energy. Despite the lack of comprehensive legislation, emissions have declined roughly 10 percent since he took office, a result both of the economic slowdown and of energy efficiency moves by government and industry.The administration is discussing with Congressional Democrats, some of whom are leery of the issue because their states are home to coal businesses, how to head off a Republican counterattack on the new regulations. Democrats are paying particular attention to the likelihood of Republicans employing a little-used procedure to block new regulations with a simple majority vote.Senate Democrats are also girding for a battle when Mr. Obama nominates a new head of the E.P.A. The agency, excoriated by Republicans as a job-killing bureaucracy, would take the lead in setting the new regulations.The approach is a turnabout from the first term, when Mr. Obama’s guiding principle in trying to pass the cap-and-trade bill was that a negotiated legislative solution was likely to be more politically palatable than regulation by executive fiat. Now there is a broad expectation that he will follow up his first big use of the E.P.A.’s powers to rein in emissions — proposed rules last year for new power plants — with a plan to crack down on emissions from existing power plants.According to estimates from the Natural Resources Defense Council, emissions from current coal-fired plants could be reduced by more than 25 percent by 2020, yielding large health and environmental benefits at relatively low cost. Such an approach would allow Mr. Obama to fulfill his 2009 pledge to reduce domestic greenhouse gas emissions by about 17 percent from 2005 levels by 2020, the group says.“There’s a really big opportunity, perhaps bigger than most people realize,” said Dan Lashof, director of the defense council’s climate and clean air program.The regulatory push will be particularly important because Mr. Obama has little prospect of winning as much money for clean energy as he did in his first term, with Republicans now in control of the House. Despite the renewed attention to climate change following Hurricane Sandy and record-high temperatures in the continental United States last year, there is little sign that the politics of the issue will get any easier for Mr. Obama."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/politics/in-springfield-ill-applause-for-obama-is-muted.html,"SPRINGFIELD, Ill. — Harvey Nelson glanced around a diner here on Monday, then dropped his voice to a hush to talk about politics. Yes, he said, looking around again at nearby tables, he voted for President Obama, and yes, he said, some signs seem to be emerging of an improving economy.“But I must confess, it’s the uncertainty of everything that bothers me right now,” said Mr. Nelson, 68, who retired from a state agency in this state capital. “The people in Washington seem unable to sit down and talk.” He added an explanation for all the whispering: fierce partisan polarization, he said, seems to have filtered out from the highest reaches of government even to places like this, Charlie Parker’s Diner, where pancakes can be as big as pizzas.Here, in the city where Barack Obama first announced his plans to run for president at the Old State Capitol, the same place where Abraham Lincoln once served, the mood of residents — both supporters and detractors of the president — appeared muted, watchful, tentative as a second term began.Mr. Obama’s strongest advocates said they were hopeful about what may be ahead for the nation on matters of immigration and gun control, but anxious about how partisan battling and Republicans in the House may complicate those efforts. And many of Mr. Obama’s critics said they felt resigned to the outcome of the election, but deeply worried about the nation’s financial footing, spending and what one resident here described as “way too many cliffs.”“All I can say is that the debt really scares me,” said another resident, Robert Lackie, 54. “Why is it so difficult to think for the future instead of just for the next election?” asked Mr. Lackie, who works in marketing and said he voted for Mr. Obama’s Republican competitors in 2012 and 2008.Although Mr. Obama easily won Illinois, his home state, in both of his elections, Springfield, where government is a significant employer, is about 200 miles southwest of Chicago, and the voters here, as in much of central and southern Illinois, are more Republican-leaning. Mr. Obama, who had served in the State Senate here, won this county, Sangamon, in 2008, but Mitt Romney won it in 2012.Around this city, residents on all sides seemed to agree mainly on one thing: Washington has grown dysfunctional — worse, many people said, than they had ever seen before and with no end in sight. Adding to the mood of uncertainty here, state politicians have also hit impasses lately: Illinois has wrestled with its own set of financial woes.“With all the speeches today, what’s going to be different tomorrow than it was yesterday?” Loren Barnes, 66, said as inauguration ceremonies blared from three giant-screen televisions above a nearly empty bar inside an American Legion post where he ate a salad on Monday. His purpose for being here, he noted, was not to watch the ceremonies in Washington. He was here for lunch.“What’s going to happen? Nothing,” said Mr. Barnes, a former farmer who works at a nonprofit operation. “We’re not doing anything. The Republicans can’t seem to get along with the Democrats. And it’s just unheard of that our credit rating goes down because of the fools in Washington and what they did.”Many spoke of signs of economic improvement — a friend who had at last found a job, a daughter who had sold her house — but said they also remained cautious about what may be ahead and reluctant about whether it was really time, say, to commit to buying a new car or more insurance.“Everyone is still in a rut,” said Elisa Williams, a teacher from the Rockford area, visiting the Abraham Lincoln Presidential Library and Museum here on Monday. “A lot depends on how the next four years go — a whole lot.”And few seemed hopeful that partisan lines might fade soon. The issues ahead seemed likely only to sharpen the anger, many here said. Those opposed to Mr. Obama’s health care law spoke pessimistically about where it would leave the nation, while supporters said they were eager to watch it play out. Supporters of increased gun restrictions said they were looking forward to seeing their children protected in the years ahead, while at least one opponent cautioned that Mr. Obama and the Democrats would be roundly rejected here if they moved to limit weapons.“We are so polarized,” said Mark Frailey, a former teacher from Belvidere, recalling a recent visit from a neighbor he barely knew. The neighbor dropped by, Mr. Frailey recalled, to rail about the debt, the budget, the nation’s troubles, apparently because he remembered that Mr. Frailey had an Obama sign in his yard in 2008.“I just let it go,” said Mr. Frailey, as he headed off to an exhibit about the struggles of President Lincoln, a beloved hometown figure in these parts. “But we really have to get beyond the bickering. ”Back at Charlie Parker’s Diner, Mr. Nelson wondered aloud about Mr. Obama’s legacy. “What I’ve seen from studying Lincoln is that it’s a really hard job, that there’s nothing you can do without people saying you’re wrong, that you can’t really be yourself, and that the pressure is always on,” Mr. Nelson said. “I sometimes wonder why people would want that job.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/opinion/invitation-to-a-dialogue-media-violence.html,"To the Editor:The National Rifle Association’s cynical exploitation of concerns about media violence to obfuscate the need for gun control trivializes a very real public health issue. Recent articles in The Times (“The Real World Forces Its Way Into the Gamers’ Universe,” Dec. 26; “Real and Virtual Firearms Nurture a Marketing Link,” Dec. 25) and elsewhere dismiss links between violent media and real-life violence, but the truth is far more complex.Research repeatedly demonstrates that, for children, exposure to violent video games, movies and television programs is a risk factor for becoming desensitized to violence, lack of sympathy for victims and aggressive behavior. Proponents for allowing purveyors of violent media unfettered access to children dismiss the research because it is correlational and not causal.But public health policy is often based on correlation between behavior and harm, and the correlation between media violence and aggression is almost as strong as the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer — and stronger than other acknowledged public health threats such as the links between not using a condom and sexually transmitted H.I.V., and early exposure to lead and lower I.Q. scores.Regardless of the role violent media played or didn’t play in the tragic Newtown shootings, children are harmed by frequent exposure to movies, video games, music and TV programs that glorify violence. We shouldn’t let the National Rifle Association’s smoke and mirrors, or the urgent need for gun control and effective, readily available mental health services, distract from the problem of media violence.We need to stop allowing children to be targets for marketing violent media, and to help parents understand its potential dangers and set limits on its consumption.SUSAN LINNBoston, Jan. 21, 2013The writer is director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and author of “Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood.”Editors’ Note: We invite readers to respond by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/us/politics/wayne-lapierre-of-nra-has-angry-response-to-obama.html,"WASHINGTON — Wayne LaPierre, the executive director of the National Rifle Association, angrily accused President Obama on Tuesday of demonizing law-abiding gun owners and of wanting to put “every private personal firearms transaction right under the thumb of the federal government.”In a fiery speech at a hunting conference in Nevada, Mr. LaPierre criticized Mr. Obama’s Inaugural Address on Monday when the president said Americans should not “mistake absolutism for principle.”That reference, Mr. LaPierre said, was intended as an attack on the N.R.A. and gun owners who believe that the Second Amendment to the Constitution provides an absolute right to bear arms.“I urge our president to use caution when attacking clearly defined absolutes in favor of his principles,” Mr. LaPierre said. “When absolutes are abandoned for principles, the U.S. Constitution becomes a blank slate for anyone’s graffiti.”Speaking on the same day that a gunfight on a Texas college campus left four people hospitalized, Mr. LaPierre gave voice to some of the resistance on Capitol Hill from Republicans who oppose efforts by the president to seek tougher restrictions on firearms.That debate is likely to begin in the days ahead as Mr. Obama’s allies in Congress formally introduce legislation seeking a ban on assault weapons, limits on high-capacity magazines and an enhanced and expanded background check system for gun purchases.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader and a supporter of gun rights, said Tuesday that he would not stand in the way of such legislation and would make sure that gun-control legislation was allowed to come to the floor of the Senate.But Mr. LaPierre angrily accused Mr. Obama of seeking to substitute his own beliefs for the absolute principles that the framers of the Constitution had established in the Bill of Rights.He said there were only two reasons government would want to expand the background check system, which he said would collect the names of gun owners into a huge federal registry.The reasons, he said: “Either to tax them, or to take them.”Mr. LaPierre said that the president had twisted the definition of the word “absolutist,” turning it into the same as the word “extremist.” He said the president’s goal was to get guns out of the hands of law-abiding citizens, leaving them only in the hands of criminals and the wealthy.“If the only way he can force you to give them up is through scorn and ridicule, believe me, he is more than willing to do it,” Mr. LaPierre said.He also accused the president of protecting the wealthy like Mr. Obama and his allies — who he said have protection for their families — by taking the guns away only from those who cannot afford paid protection.“We are told that wanting the same technology that the criminals and our elites are protected by for themselves is a form of absolutism,” Mr. LaPierre said. “Barack Obama is saying that the only principled way of making children safe” is making other people less safe, he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/nyregion/brooklyn-tabernacle-choir-at-inauguration-reaches-global-audience.html,"When Senator Charles E. Schumer introduced the singers of “The Battle Hymn of the Republic” at President Obama’s second inauguration, he first called them the “award-winning tabernacle choir,” as if the huge crowd were expecting another, more famous group, the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.But the senator, the inauguration’s impresario and M.C., quickly, with a mischievous smile, corrected himself. With a prideful emphasis he called the group “the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir.”Whether his correction was an effort to draw attention to the choir’s urban roots in his own home borough, the appearance of the Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir was a stirring moment in a ceremony in which a major theme was remaking a country where “a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.”The choir started 40 years ago with just nine members of a struggling nondenominational church housed in a rundown building on Atlantic Avenue near where the Barclays Center now sits. Today, according to its Brooklyn-bred pastor, Jim Cymbala, 69, the choir is almost 300 strong and sings at services each Sunday in the 4,000-seat former Loew’s Metropolitan theater in Downtown Brooklyn. On an average Sunday, he said, 10,000 worshipers can pass through the doors for the three services.The choir, with only a few trained musicians, is drawn from the congregation, which includes a multiracial mix of lawyers, doctors and other professionals from brownstone Brooklyn, but also former crack addicts and homeless people from other neighborhoods.“It’s a beautiful melting pot,” Mr. Cymbala said.The choir is directed by his wife, Carol, 65, Chicago-born but Brooklyn-raised. She cannot read sheet music but has an innate musical sense for captivating harmonies, he said. The choir has won six Grammy Awards for gospel singing and performed at Carnegie Hall and Radio City Music Hall, as well as during Billy Graham crusades.But no previous event matched the grandeur and spectacle of the inauguration, which was seen on television by more than a billion people. On a chilly but brightly sunny day, the choir members stood on a high balcony outside the Capitol and were decked out in new coats — crimson and fur-lined for the women, navy blue with red scarves for the men — contributed by a Macy’s executive who is a member of the Brooklyn Tabernacle church.Looking over the president, his cabinet, the Supreme Court, members of Congress and a crowd in the hundreds of thousands, they sang a new arrangement of “Battle Hymn” by Mrs. Cymbala and her assistant, Jason Michael Webb. On television, a pleased Mr. Obama was seen craning his neck to look up as they sang. Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and former President Bill Clinton similarly strained to watch.The experience, Mrs. Cymbala said later, left the choir members deeply moved.“They were weeping,” she said. “It meant so much to them. We’re just average people but we represent this country, and that we could be there, it was such an honor for us.”Alicia Olatuja, 30, a mezzo-soprano who sang the hymn’s solo phrase that begins with the words “In the beauty of the lilies,” said she did not fully realize the impact of the choir’s performance until she boarded the bus to return home and her smartphone lighted up with 150 text messages and hundreds of Twitter posts.“My Facebook page had hundreds of comments, and my mother’s phone actually crashed,” Ms. Olatuja said. “And when I saw the video and saw the look on the president’s face, that’s when it really hit me: ‘You actually affected people in a positive way.’ ”Durell Comedy, 26, a professional dancer with the Limón Dance Company and a choir member since 2009, also said it took some time for the singularity of his singing at a presidential inauguration to fully register — until he returned to his Downtown Brooklyn home and watched a video of it.“I know I can tell my children and grandchildren that I and the choir sang for the president,” he said, “and not only for him but to represent our country and our people.”The invitation to the choir had come from Senator Schumer, who was making arrangements last summer for the inauguration even though it was far from clear then that Mr. Obama would win a second term. Mr. Cymbala, who watched the events on Monday from his apartment in Brooklyn, said Mr. Schumer had visited the church occasionally and addressed the congregation, so he was familiar with the choir and the life changes many of its members had gone through. Many of the congregants say they have been born again, the pastor said.“People who were drug addicts put their faith in Christ and found the power in him not to do drugs anymore,” Mr. Cymbala said. “People who were suicidal, were making money but had no meaning in life, found meaning through the message of Christ and the Gospel.”Bursting with pleasure at the performance was not just Mr. Schumer, but also Marty Markowitz, the borough’s president and its chief cheerleader.“The Brooklyn Tabernacle represents Brooklyn at its best and our ethnic diversity,” Mr. Markowitz said in a telephone interview. “It just fulfilled what I really believe, that Brooklyn is the heart of America.”"

Luis Leon and the poet Richard Blanco, to how in Mr. Blanco’s words “20 children were marked absent today, and forever.”¶And from the interracial Brooklyn Tabernacle Choir to James Taylor and Beyoncé.This inspiringly inclusive and maybe first thoroughly 21st-century inaugural shows that Barack Obama’s re-election was a statement that change has truly come to America.And “in the words of the old Negro spiritual” that the Rev.

The path toward the “sustainable energy sources” he says are required will be obstructed by foes determined to safeguard the interests of coal, oil and natural gas.More than just merely being loath to challenge these interests, many members of Congress, including some from the president’s own party, have championed them.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/opinion/amgen-gets-a-gift-from-congress.html,"For a disheartening example of how intense lobbying and financial contributions can distort the legislative process in Washington, consider what happened to the “fiscal cliff” bill approved three weeks ago by Congress.Senators who play a major role in federal health care financing were happy to help Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, evade Medicare cost-cutting controls by delaying price restraints on a class of drugs used by kidney dialysis patients, including Sensipar, a drug made by Amgen. That provision was inserted into the final fiscal bill by Senate aides. Many members of Congress did not know it was in the bill until just hours before it was approved.Although other companies will benefit financially from that delay, Amgen, which has 74 lobbyists in Washington, was the only company to lobby aggressively for the provision. The delay will cost the Medicare program up to $500 million over a two-year period.The disturbing details were revealed in a report by Eric Lipton and Kevin Sack of The Times on Sunday. The maneuvering to exempt these drugs undercuts a five-year effort to change the incentives used to pay for kidney dialysis care. Previously, Medicare had paid providers separately for the drugs and for administering dialysis treatment, a system that often encouraged overprescribing.But, in 2008, Congress reversed the incentives by requiring Medicare to pay a single, bundled rate for a patient’s dialysis treatment and related medications, starting in 2011. But certain oral drugs, including Sensipar, were given a two-year reprieve, to expire in 2014, from being included in that more cost-effective bundled system. The fiscal bill has now extended that exclusion for an additional two years.Supporters of the delay — notably, Senator Max Baucus, a Democrat of Montana, who leads the Senate Finance Committee, and Orrin Hatch, of Utah, the ranking Republican on that committee — say it is needed to give the Medicare system and dialysis providers time to absorb other complicated changes in federal reimbursements for kidney care. But there is good reason to suspect other factors were involved as well. Both senators have political and financial ties to Amgen, as does Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, who exerted great influence over the fiscal negotiations and praised the Medicare provisions.A top aide to Mr. Hatch, who was involved in negotiating the dialysis delay, previously worked as a health policy analyst for Amgen. The current lobbyists for Amgen include former chiefs of staff for both Mr. Baucus and Mr. McConnell. And the three senators have received substantial contributions from Amgen’s employees and its political action committee since 2007 — almost $68,000 to Senator Baucus, $59,000 to Senator Hatch, and $73,000 to Senator McConnell.Amgen’s strong influence prevailed even though it had pleaded guilty just weeks ago to marketing an anti-anemia drug illegally and agreed to pay criminal and civil penalties of $762 million, a record settlement for a biotechnology company.This dreadful episode is a classic example of the power of special interests to shape legislation and shows how hard it may be to carry out the reforms needed to cut health care costs."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/nyregion/misinformation-behind-brooklyn-honeys-absence-at-inaugural-luncheon.html,"After getting sworn in for his second term, President Obama joined his wife and 220 others for the traditional Inaugural Luncheon, held in the Capitol’s grand Statuary Hall.Senator Charles E. Schumer served as master of ceremonies for the luncheon, which featured an array of edible goodies from New York State. Notably absent, though, was a sweet treat: Brooklyn honey.“The honey was originally going to come from Red Hook in Brooklyn,” Mr. Schumer told a reporter before the event. “They were wiped out in Sandy, the bees and the hive.”This perplexed several beekeepers in Red Hook. One, Yeshwant Chitalkar, a community psychiatrist and purveyor of Red Hook Honey, said his bees and hives weathered the storm just fine. Mr. Chitalkar keeps two hives on the rooftop of his home and sells his wares at neighborhood shops.As the winds were picking up in Hurricane Sandy’s approach, he strapped down the hives to guard against the boxes’ flying apart and killing the queen bees. While the hurricane’s surging waters wiped out the entire garden-floor level of Mr. Chitalkar’s home, the hives were barely touched, save for one of them, which traveled a few inches in the wind, but otherwise stayed upright.“With the bees, everything is fine,” Mr. Chitalkar said. “They’re in there right now.”Another local beekeeper, Ian Curry, said that while many of his bees were lost, a number survived by crowding to the top of the hive, which he keeps in his backyard. “They’re hanging in there as of last time I checked,” he wrote in an e-mail on Tuesday.A member of Mr. Schumer’s staff said the honey information had been supplied by the caterer for the luncheon, Design Cuisine. But Rickie Niceta, the company’s account executive, said the honey was never to have come from Red Hook, but rather the Brooklyn Grange, which runs rooftop gardens and indeed lost more than a dozen hives to the storm. Yet those hives were kept at the Brooklyn Navy Yard — several neighborhoods and miles north of Red Hook.Anastasia Plakias, one of Brooklyn Grange’s partners, said the loss of hives to the storm had nothing to do with why they could not supply the honey (for security reasons, Ms. Niceta did not disclose that the event was the Inaugural Luncheon); rather it was because of the seasonal run on honey: the request came during holiday season, and at that time they had just nine jars left.In any event, it is unclear where Mr. Schumer, who has fought so-called honey laundering (contaminated honey smuggled from China), got the idea that the honey was to have come from Red Hook. A spokesman said in an e-mail that he was “not sure where the wires were crossed.”Nevertheless, in the end, the celebrants were still able to eat honey. It came from Seaway Trail Honey in Rochester, and was served with sour cream ice cream and apple pie."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/us/governor-lepage-not-speaking-to-democratic-leaders.html,"AUGUSTA, Me. — Temperatures soared into the mid-50s here last week but the capitol building was nonetheless in the grip of a big chill.The governor, Paul R. LePage, a Republican who won office in 2010 with the backing of the Tea Party, has been giving the Democratic leaders the cold shoulder. He has refused to meet or speak with them since the Democrats took back the Legislature in November.The standoff started over the governor’s annoyance at being followed by a Democratic cameraman, known as a tracker, who films him at public events. It continues even now as the governor and legislative leaders begin to grapple with a new state budget that could lead to a major increase in property taxes.And that is not the only source of economic anxiety here; Maine continues to lag behind the rest of New England, and much of the country, in recovering from the recession. Its difficulties were underscored last month when Forbes ranked Maine 50th in its annual list of business-friendly states. It was the third year in a row that Maine came in last.Mr. LePage essentially agreed with the Forbes assessment. He said that if Puerto Rico were included in the ranking, Maine would come in 51st. He frequently deplores the quality of the state’s work force and says the schools do not properly prepare students for college.Such blunt talk has led his fans to compare Mr. LePage to Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is also a Republican. But his critics see little charm in someone who, in their view, runs the state down and bullies the opposition.In early December, the governor was set to meet with the new Democratic leaders, the Senate president, Justin Alfond, and speaker of the House, Mark Eaves. But he canceled, saying he objected to the cameraman, who, he said, filmed him at a Veterans Day event in November while he was talking with an elderly veteran in ill health. Mr. LePage said the people of Maine should not be used as “props” to score political points.The video, released by the Democrats, showed no such encounter between Mr. LePage and an elderly veteran. Nonetheless, the governor insisted the legislators call off the tracker, which they refused to do, saying they had no control in the matter.Shortly afterward, Mr. Alfond sent the governor a handwritten invitation to dinner. But the invitation landed in the hands of the news media before it got to the governor, prompting the governor’s office to brand the invitation a stunt.Mr. Alfond said in an interview that the governor’s snub was less about the use of trackers, who are now a standard part of politics for both parties, than about power. “If he doesn’t meet with me, it keeps that clear hierarchy,” Mr. Alfond said. “He likes that power play.”Adrienne Bennett, the governor’s spokeswoman, declined a request for an interview with the governor. As for his relationship with the Democratic leaders, she said she did not expect it to thaw any time soon. “When you want to play political games, he’s uninterested in engaging,” she said. Besides, she said, the leaders have access to the governor’s staff.The standoff could become problematic as the two sides, miles apart ideologically, try to balance the state budget. The governor has proposed the drastic step of suspending revenue sharing with the state’s municipalities for two years, a move that could save the state about $200 million. He has said the suspension is necessary to make up for federal cuts in reimbursements for health and welfare programs.Democrats say the governor is shifting costs to the localities to make up for tax cuts that are costing the state almost $350 million in lost revenue and disproportionately benefit wealthier residents. They say the shift will force localities either to slash services or raise property taxes.Their vast differences over the budget have set the governor and Democrats on a collision course that some predict could end in a government shutdown — something Maine, which prides itself on its bipartisanship, last experienced in 1991.The rising tensions over the budget were evident last week when the governor met with three independent House members who do not caucus with either the Democrats or Republicans. When they told Mr. LePage that municipalities could be forced to raise property taxes by hundreds of dollars, the governor grew angry, pounded the table, called them “idiots” and later swore at them, according to The Bangor Daily News.“He went right through the roof when I asked him the question,” Representative Jeff Evangelos told the newspaper. “He flew up like a jack-in-the-box and ran out of the room and slammed the door.”It is too early in the budget process to say whether Republicans will back Mr. LePage or join the Democrats, who need only a handful of Republicans in each house to override a veto. The degree to which any Republicans defect could provide an early indication of how Mr. LePage might fare in 2014 when he is up for re-election, assuming he runs again.For now, Republican lawmakers are soft-pedaling any talk of a split. “It’s not as awkward as you think,” said Senator Michael Thibodeau, the Republican minority leader. He said that the governor’s standoff with the Democrats was a news media-driven distraction and that Mr. LePage was simply too busy to meet with them.Senator Roger Katz, the assistant minority leader, has complained before about Mr. LePage’s approach to governance. He wrote a column in 2011, signed by some fellow Republicans, saying that Mr. LePage’s penchant for demeaning comments lowered the bar for civil discourse.Mr. Katz said last week that the governor’s problem was still one of tone, though he was unhappy with the budget proposal too. “As a general rule,” Mr. Katz said, “the more people of good will talk to each other, the better. I don’t know why it hasn’t happened yet.”Later in the week, the temperatures outside the State House plunged into the single digits, more in keeping with the frosty relations inside."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/opinion/chavez-the-missing-president.html,"CARACAS, VenezuelaON Jan. 10, while Hugo Chávez lay in a hospital bed in Havana, he was symbolically sworn in as Venezuela’s new president in a ceremony here. The crowd that attended his virtual inauguration was moved to tears by a recording of Mr. Chávez’s singing the national anthem. The country is experiencing the very odd circumstance of being both with and without its leader; he is not here, but his voice endures.From the intensive care unit, the president “continues to perform his duties”; he gives orders and sends kisses to children. This is what his vice president says. According to the Supreme Court, the Congress cannot consider him absent, for no matter how ill he is, only Mr. Chávez himself has the authority to declare himself absent. The opposition is demanding a “fe de vida” — proof that he is still alive, as if he were a kidnapping victim. Day after day, on the street, on Twitter, our president dies and comes back to life. But this is not a magical realist novel.After 14 years as president, Mr. Chávez controls all public powers: the legislative body, the Supreme Court, the public prosecutor’s office, to say nothing of the oil industry. Of all those who have held office since the end of the military dictatorship in 1958, none has concentrated power quite as Mr. Chávez has.From the moment he won his first election, he knew that he had not made it to the presidency in order to run a sound government. He had come to change the course of history. In the name of the dispossessed, he revived the ghost of the South American military caudillo, creating a new version of that traditional strongman. He sings ranchera songs on Sunday and negotiates with Iran on Monday. He is a child of the telenovela who invokes the old-fashioned left. As president he deftly combines power with melodrama.He astutely took advantage of the failure of neoliberalism and the traditional elites, as well as the antipolitical climate at the time, promising to democratize the country’s oil income and eliminate deep social inequalities. And riding the wave of an oil boom, he secured the loyalty of the poor.But his “21st century socialism” is a populist, patronage-oriented model that depends less on ideology than it does on the price of a barrel of crude. He has managed to revive the illusion of a sustainable society that distributes rather than creates wealth. And thanks to this illusion, he has been able to maintain his ironclad grip on power.Last October’s elections gave him the chance to complete, “democratically,” 20 years as president. “Veinte años no es nada,” he said — a line from a famous tango song meaning “20 years is nothing.” More than eight million voters seemed to agree with him; probably around the number of people who have benefited from his administration’s social programs, which are called, rather religiously, “missions.” (Though the government says the number is much higher.)Venezuelans today are less poor than they once were. But they are also far more dependent on the state, and more susceptible to a propaganda machine that attributes this “miracle” to Mr. Chávez. Over the past decade, his government has invested around $400 billion in social spending, an oil-infused luxury that few countries in the region have ever been able to indulge in.There is one element of the Chávez leadership, however, that is no different from any of Latin America’s other personality-driven authoritarian regimes: its messianic nature. “With Chávez, everything; without Chávez, nothing,” is the government’s official slogan. “We are all Chávez” is its battle cry and love song. Over time, the state has built a powerful industry around the cult of personality. Few Venezuelans will ever forget the moment when Mr. Chávez, in a televised event at a church, implored Jesus Christ for more days on earth. Now, following an uncertain convalescence in Cuba that is being closely monitored by the Castro brothers, the president of Venezuela is already a myth on his way to consecration.When he does go, many will feel orphaned. He fashioned himself into the axis around which the life of the country revolved, and his unique brand of authority will, without his physical presence, be very difficult to maintain. His absence will create a void in a society that was forced to divide and organize itself in two blocks: for or against Chávez. The propaganda machine that has turned Mr. Chávez into a religious talisman will not necessarily serve to legitimize the many pretenders, including his chosen successor, Vice President Nicolás Maduro, who are waiting to inherit his charismatic legacy.That legacy, of course, is more than pure messianic zeal. Mr. Chávez will leave behind a country plagued with problems. With deep political divisions. With an appalling level of violence, including around 21,000 homicides last year. With the wild economic distortions that come from having some of the highest inflation on the continent and the cheapest gasoline on the planet. With dwindling productivity, an overvalued currency and an enormous foreign debt load. With unchecked public spending, and still one great dream that has yet to be fulfilled: the illusion of eliminating poverty forever.To this end, absence might be just what Hugo Chávez needs to save him from his own failure. Myths survive only when they rise above the miseries of reality."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/us/politics/first-test-of-new-term-comes-in-cabinet-hearings.html,"WASHINGTON — For President Obama, the first test of his second term passed peacefully on Tuesday as his nominee for defense secretary, Chuck Hagel, sat down with the Republican who poses one of his biggest potential hurdles to Senate confirmation, Senator John McCain of Arizona.By all accounts, the 45-minute one-on-one meeting went well enough for the White House to feel that it has finally turned the tide in favor of Mr. Hagel, whose positions on Israel and Iran have drawn heavy fire from conservatives, pro-Israel groups and other critics.While Mr. McCain did not say how he would vote on Mr. Hagel, he told reporters that he would reserve judgment until after Mr. Hagel’s confirmation hearing on Jan. 31. And Mr. McCain characterized the meeting as a “frank and candid” exchange between two “old friends.”That was enough for administration officials, one of whom said the meeting was a “very positive sign about the trajectory of things.” Mr. Hagel, who is running a gantlet of meetings, also won a positive response from Senator Angus King, the newly elected independent from Maine.Mr. Obama’s inauguration marked the beginning of the next phase in his campaign to install a new national security team. This week, John O. Brennan, his choice to be director of the Central Intelligence Agency, will begin meeting with senators, some of whom have raised questions about the administration’s policy on the targeted killing of terrorist suspects.On Thursday, Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat whom Mr. Obama selected to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is expected to breeze through his hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which he still leads.Mr. Hagel is still likely to face tough questioning from the Senate Armed Services Committee. He and Mr. McCain, once close friends with the shared experience of being Vietnam veterans, became estranged because of differences over the Iraq war and how to deal with Iran. Mr. McCain left little doubt that he raised those issues in their meeting and would do so again during the committee’s hearing.But White House officials say they are increasingly sanguine that Mr. Hagel will prevail. Democratic senators have largely fallen into line since he won the blessing of Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the most influential Jewish member of the Senate.Mr. Schumer’s endorsement was viewed as crucial by the White House because it allayed concerns among Democrats about Mr. Hagel’s positions on Israel and his use of the phrase “Jewish lobby” to refer to pro-Israel lobbying groups. On Friday, Mr. Hagel met with several Jewish groups, including the American Israel Public Affairs Committee and the Anti-Defamation League, to try to ease their concerns.Privately, administration officials figure that Mr. Hagel could get as many as 60 votes, a threshold that would allow him to overcome a filibuster. Even if the vote ends up shy of 60, Congressional aides said, it is not clear that Republicans will try to block his confirmation, especially if Mr. McCain does not stake out a strong position against him.When Mr. Obama signed papers formally nominating Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerry and Mr. Brennan after his Inaugural Address on Monday, he said, “I’m sending a few nominations up, which I know will be handled with great dispatch.” Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. chuckled softly, as Republican Congressional leaders looked on silently.In his recent meetings on Capitol Hill, officials said, Mr. Hagel has sounded a more hawkish tone on issues like American sanctions on Iran, about which he had once been skeptical.“If he has answers for members who have concerns about his past statements,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who met with Mr. Hagel last week, “then I think the chances of his being confirmed will become fairly strong.”Aside from his Senate meetings, Mr. Hagel has kept a low profile in recent days. He did not attend the inauguration or Mr. Biden’s swearing-in ceremony on Sunday, despite having a seat reserved for him (a logistical mix-up, an official said, since he had decided to stay home to prepare for his confirmation).With Mr. Hagel’s prospects improving, some analysts say the nominee to watch is Mr. Brennan, whom Mr. Obama has chosen as a permanent replacement for David H. Petraeus at the C.I.A., who resigned in November after admitting to an extramarital affair.Shortly after Mr. Brennan’s nomination was announced, he began encountering resistance from Republicans concerned by what they said were national security leaks after the raid that killed Osama bin Laden.Now, though, Mr. Brennan is facing questions from Democrats over the use of drone strikes and the killing of American citizens in counterterrorism operations — decisions in which he was deeply immersed as the counterterrorism adviser in the White House.Last week, Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, a Democrat on the Intelligence Committee, wrote to Mr. Brennan, demanding that lawmakers be allowed to review the Justice Department’s legal opinion on assassinations, including that of Anwar al-Awlaki, the American-born cleric who was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.The White House has fought to keep these opinions secret. Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California and the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, has also called on the administration to release the legal opinion in the Awlaki case. She is likely to raise it in Mr. Brennan’s confirmation hearing, which is scheduled for Feb. 7.The only nominee who seems likely to have a trouble-free experience is Mr. Kerry. Unlike Mr. Hagel, Mr. Kerry was a visible presence at the Capitol on Monday, shaking hands with Mr. Obama after his speech and chatting later with former President Bill Clinton.Mr. Kerry’s hearing, in fact, may seem anticlimactic, coming the day after Mrs. Clinton’s long-awaited Congressional testimony on the deadly attack on the American Mission in Benghazi, Libya. She will testify on Wednesday before both the Senate and House.Mr. McCain, perhaps trying to inject some drama into Mr. Kerry’s hearing, joked Tuesday that the Senate would subject him to “waterboarding” to get the truth out of him."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/nyregion/cuomo-used-all-his-means-to-pass-gun-control-package.html,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo was in his 39th floor office above Third Avenue in Manhattan, after meeting with corporate executives to ask for help lobbying Congress for federal Hurricane Sandy aid, when he heard the news: A gunman had opened fire in an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., killing 20 children.He called his counterpart in Connecticut, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy, to offer condolences.“I didn’t even have the words,” he said. “It was incomprehensible.”One month later, Mr. Cuomo claimed victory, stunning many observers with the speed and apparent ease with which he pushed a gun control package through a divided Legislature. The State Senate, controlled by a coalition of 30 Republicans and 6 Democrats, approved the package, which included a significant expansion of the state’s assault weapons ban, on its first day in session; the Assembly, controlled by Democrats, followed suit the next day, and the governor signed the legislation into law.The weeks between the mass shooting and the bill signing illustrated the classic Cuomo formula, honed over years in public life and refined during his first two years as governor. Eggs are broken, speed rules, an open process is sacrificed, and results are achieved — sometimes triumphant, often jagged and imperfect. Before New York’s new gun control law was even passed, lawmakers were acknowledging that they would have to pass a second measure to clean up some of its errors.Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat who is often mentioned as a possible presidential contender in 2016, had been determined that New York would be the first in the nation to respond to the school massacre. And he saw opportunity presented by change: the Senate, which had been controlled entirely by Republicans skeptical of new gun laws, now was governed by a coalition that included some urban Democrats who wanted gun control. The state’s population was sympathetic too — even on Long Island, a Republican stronghold but also a largely suburban region, haunted by memories of a 1993 shooting rampage on the Long Island Rail Road.First, there were threats, delivered in phone calls or through intermediaries: He would seek to dissolve their fledgling coalition by pressuring his fellow Democrats to reunite; pummel recalcitrant Republican senators for months with a seven-figure advertising blitz backed by national groups like the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence; and campaign on Long Island, where 9 of the 30 Republican senators live, and across the state.Then, there was the cajoling. Guns, he told the Republicans, were not the issue for them to take a stand on. He shared with them his internal polling data, which showed popular support for a tighter ban on assault weapons, even among gun owners.There is a dispute over what exactly Mr. Cuomo then said to senior Republicans. A person with direct knowledge of the exchanges quoted Mr. Cuomo as saying: “You think your record is good the last two cycles? Maybe you should listen to me? Maybe I should be your consultant!”A senior Cuomo administration official denied that such statements had been made or that there was any contentiousness between the Democratic governor, seeking new gun laws, and the Republican Senate leadership, leery of such laws. But clearly, there was aggressive talk.“He wanted to get this done, and he was push, push, push,” said State Senator Thomas W. Libous of Binghamton, the chamber’s second-ranking Republican and the governor’s closest ally in the Republican caucus.“Some people don’t know how to take that,” Mr. Libous added. “I understand; sometimes I can be passionate too. Sometimes, when we want something, we push hard for it. The governor is trying to make his mark.”Mr. Cuomo had been a longtime supporter of gun control, and after the mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo., last summer, he instructed his aides to begin developing new gun control proposals. But he had done little publicly, other than making an occasional comment at a news conference, until Newtown.“I think for me, like for people all across this country, that was it,” the governor said in an interview last week. “You said, ‘Enough.’ That was it. It’s not an intellectual response; it was more emotional, visceral. Just, it was enough.”Mr. Cuomo, who has three teenage daughters, said he could not help but think of them.“Anyone who has a child remembers the first day they dropped the child off at school and they remember that feeling in the pit of their stomach when they were driving away, that little fear that they felt in their spine that said, ‘You know, I’m leaving my child; God forbid something were to happen,’ ” he recalled. “This said you were right to have that anxiety, because your nightmare actually came true.”The governor’s aides worked with several advocacy groups, including the Brady Campaign in Washington, New Yorkers Against Gun Violence and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence in San Francisco, to develop a package of measures that would be comprehensive but also politically achievable. They looked to other states; a provision in the new law to require mental health professionals to report possibly violent patients was similar to a recommendation by a task force created last year by Gov. Martin O’Malley and state legislators in Maryland.For a time, Mr. Cuomo and his team were so eager to act that they contemplated calling the Legislature into special session in December. By the time a few dozen lawmakers had assembled in Albany the week before Christmas for an economic development meeting, negotiations were moving so rapidly that the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, instructed his members not to leave the capital until they had called his office — just in case a gun control deal was ready.The Assembly was clearly ready to support new gun control, so Mr. Cuomo focused his lobbying on the Senate, where the outcome was less certain.A few days after the shooting, the Senate Democrats had chosen a new leader, Andrea Stewart-Cousins of Westchester County. Mr. Cuomo invited her to visit. When she arrived, he offered his congratulations and then turned to gun control. By the end of the session, Senator Stewart-Cousins had pledged that all 26 members of her caucus would support his effort.Mr. Cuomo believed he could get the votes to pass a gun control measure in the Senate, but any doubt was erased by a Dec. 24 ambush in Webster, near Rochester, in which a lone gunman set fire to a car and his house, then killed two firefighters who responded.“To the extent the Legislature needed any reinforcement, there was no question after Webster,” Mr. Cuomo said.He courted a newly elected senator, Simcha Felder, a Democrat from Brooklyn who had decided to align himself with the Republican caucus. And he sat down with the five Democrats whose Independent Democratic Conference had struck a power-sharing agreement with the Senate Republicans; afterward, their leader, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Bronx Democrat, told reporters he was squarely behind the governor’s effort.Even with the votes, Mr. Cuomo still had to ensure that the Senate Republican leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, would not try to prevent the bill from coming to the floor. Senator Skelos and his aides wanted to impose stiffer penalties on the use of illegal guns; extend and expand Kendra’s Law, which empowers judges to order mentally ill patients to receive outpatient treatment; and soften some of the new provisions restricting assault weapons and high-capacity magazines.Mr. Cuomo was open to the first two of those requests, and he also did not push the Legislature to approve microstamping, a controversial form of ballistics identification, which he had supported but which had been met with resistance by Republicans. In an effort to further mollify their conference, the Senate Republican leadership distributed to their members a one-page handout listing 15 “rejected Democrat proposals,” crediting themselves with rebuffing, among other things, a suggestion to confiscate guns now deemed assault weapons and limit gun purchases to one per month. “Can buy unlimited number of guns,” the senators were reassured.The weekend after the Jan. 9 State of the State address, Mr. Cuomo and his allies received some help: A poll by Newsday and Siena College found that more than 7 in 10 residents on Long Island supported an expanded ban on assault weapons. Recalling the Newsday poll, Speaker Silver said, “I think it may have sealed it.”On the first full day of the Legislative session, the Senate Republicans met behind closed doors for several hours to discuss the measure, while gun-rights activists tried, futilely, to put the brakes on a deal. The head of the state’s National Rifle Association affiliate, Thomas H. King, showed up at the office of the Senate Republicans; Mr. Skelos, he said later, would not see him.Around 9 p.m., Senator Gregory R. Ball of Putnam County, a gun-rights advocate and avid trap shooter, emerged from the Republicans’ private meeting with a defeated look. “I don’t think any lives will be saved today,” he said. “The only life that may have been helped is the political life of Andrew Cuomo running for president.”Later, on his way to the floor, Mr. Skelos acknowledged that the gun issue was “difficult for many to deal with,” but he described the final bill as “well balanced.” He voted for it, as did all of his Long Island colleagues in the Senate who were present."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/media/keds-campaign-features-taylor-swift.html,"IN the 1960s, among fads like Mad Libs and the Twist, there was a popular type of joke known as a “Tom Swifty,” named for the children’s-book hero Tom Swift, in which a punning verb or adverb set off a sentence: “I’ll have a martini,” Tom said dryly. “We just struck oil,” Tom gushed. “Hurry up and get in the back of the ship,” Tom said sternly.The 21st century equivalent may be the Taylor Swifty, named for Taylor Swift, the young singer and songwriter whose relationships have become fodder for comedians online and offline.Magazines including Life & Style, Time and The Week have mocked Ms. Swift’s proclivity for writing songs about her ex-boyfriends. And during the Golden Globes, as Sam Fox, the 23-year-old son of Michael J. Fox, helped present the awards, Tina Fey pretended to warn Ms. Swift against dating him.As Taylor Swifties proliferate in the media, the Keds line of footwear is preparing to introduce a campaign featuring Ms. Swift that delivers a strongly social message to the brand’s young, female target audience. The campaign, scheduled to begin in print, online and in social media on Thursday, appeals to “brave girls” and “bravehearts” and offers Ms. Swift as a role model.“If you’re lucky enough to be different from everyone else,” Ms. Swift is quoted as saying in one ad, “don’t change to be the same.”Another ad offers advice like this: “Try things. Say hi already. Laugh a lot. Mess up. Apologize. Mess up again. Hug people. Take chances. Trust yourself.” The litany ends, “Be brave and you’ll have the time of your life.”A special Web site, bravehearts.com, and a section of the Keds Web site, keds.com, are to be devoted to the campaign’s theme, carrying encouraging words like “Welcome, brave girl, keep your head high and your heart open” and “Don’t you dream impossible things?”The campaign, with a budget estimated at $20 million, is being handled by Toth & Company, for the creative aspects; the ShopPR division of Lippe Taylor, for the digital and social media elements; and PGR Media, for the media duties.The campaign builds on a relationship between Keds and Ms. Swift that started in October, when Keds sold red sneakers inspired by her new album, “Red.” Now, Ms. Swift becomes the face of the Keds brand, which since May has been owned by another familiar name in footwear, Wolverine Worldwide.Ms. Swift’s growing relationship with Keds comes as her marketing presence has increased. For instance, she worked with the Walgreens and Duane Reade units of the Walgreen Company to sell merchandise bearing her name, which included T-shirts, posters and calendars, in an effort that began in October and continued through the Christmas shopping season.“She’s a classic in the mold of the great country singers with wide appeal” like Garth Brooks, said Ira Mayer, publisher and executive editor at The Licensing Letter, a newsletter in New York, part of Business Valuation Resources. “Even people who don’t like country music like her.”Mr. Mayer said he did not believe that the jokes about Ms. Swift would detract from her appeal as an endorser.Although “no one wants his or her love life hung out on the line to dry,” he said, such “gossip is part of what celebrities have to cope with nowadays.”The jests about Ms. Swift, who is 23, have not affected her image, according to widely followed measurements of celebrity popularity known as Q scores. “She’s been remarkable in her ability to retain her above-average appeal,” said Henry Schafer, executive vice president at the Q Scores Company in Manhasset, N.Y.Ms. Swift’s Q score is 24, Mr. Schafer said, compared with 17 for the average celebrity and 16 for the average female singer. And with females age 13 to 24 — the intended audience for the Keds campaign — her Q score is 26, he said.“Her emotional connection with that demographic is very strong,” Mr. Schafer said, so for Keds “she looks like a good choice.”Among children ages 6 to 12, he added, Ms. Swift’s Q score is 45.The campaign represents a significant increase in ad spending in major media for Keds. According to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, spending totaled $1.7 million in 2010, $1.1 million in 2011 and $363,000 in the first nine months of last year.“We started doing a lot of consumer insight work,” said Rick Blackshaw, president for Keds in Lexington, Mass., and found that “heroes are important” to the brand’s target audience.“We thought about who would be Brave Girl No. 1,” he said, and came up with Ms. Swift, who “at 14 convinced her family to move to Nashville so she could pursue her musical career.”As for the Taylor Swifties, “it’s nothing we’re going to comment on,” Mr. Blackshaw said. “We think she is a fantastic role model, an incredible talent and really meaningful to our girl.”That was echoed by Bob Fouhy, president at Toth in Cambridge, Mass., who praised Ms. Swift because “she so strongly embodies what the Keds brand is about: being eternally optimistic and confident.”“The world says what the world says about celebrities these days,” he added. “We’ve worked with lots of celebrities, and she was remarkably down to earth, considering her ‘superstarness.’ ”There are plans for the campaign to include other elements like scholarships and mentorships."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/opinion/republican-myopia-on-benghazi.html,"Congressional Republicans like nothing more than beating a dead horse if it might embarrass the Obama administration — like their unceasing attempt to accuse the administration of lying to the American people about the attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens.The allegations are specious, but that didn’t stop some Republicans from repeating them on Wednesday during Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton’s Congressional testimony. Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky was particularly out of control, rather absurdly comparing the scope of the Benghazi attack to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.It’s not clear what drives this obsession after the Republicans’ failed attempt to derail President Obama’s re-election over Benghazi. Is it the prospect, however vague it now is, that Mrs. Clinton might run for president in 2016?Mrs. Clinton was professional and authoritative for hours in the witness chair before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and, later, the House Committee on Foreign Affairs. But she understandably reached her limit when Senator Ron Johnson pummeled her with the same questions Republicans have hammered at repeatedly since Mr. Stevens and his colleagues were killed in September. These have nothing to do with what happened, why and how to prevent a recurrence, but whether various statements — especially by Susan Rice, the United States ambassador to the United Nations — proved to be perfectly accurate.“With all due respect, the fact is we had four dead Americans,” Mrs. Clinton said, her voice rising in anger. “Was it because of a protest? Or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided they’d go and kill some Americans? What difference, at this point, does it make?”She said, rightly, that in the days after the attack, officials were struggling in real time, under crisis conditions, to get the best information they could. What is essential now is to improve security, not keep rehashing the C.I.A.-authorized talking points that Ms. Rice delivered on the Sunday talk shows, she said.There were, of course, serious questions raised, including how Democrats and Republicans need to approve sufficient funds to protect embassies and diplomats overseas. But there was also a fair amount of surreal behavior.Mr. Paul asked about Mrs. Clinton’s recent ill health in one breath and then in the next declared that, if he had been president, he would have fired her for Benghazi. Calling the killings the “worst tragedy” since Sept. 11 was insulting to the nearly 8,000 soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan or the many hundreds of Americans killed in senseless gun violence each year. We know politicians are short on perspective, but some is required."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/us/politics/virginia-senates-redistricting-is-protested.html,"On Monday, one of Virginia’s state senators attended the inauguration: Henry L. Marsh III, a longtime civil rights lawyer, who played hooky to witness a milestone for an African-American president.The same day, Republicans back in the state capital, Richmond, took advantage of his absence to win a party-line vote, 20 to 19, to redraw electoral maps in a way that Democrats say dilute African-Americans’ voting strength.The move not only has Democrats howling about a power grab, it has also been criticized by Virginia’s Republican governor and lieutenant governor.Redrawing districts to favor the party in power is hardly new in Virginia, or elsewhere. Democrats redrew the state map in 2011 when they held the majority in the Senate, although their efforts to achieve electoral gains were less than successful: they lost control of the chamber later that year.Republican senators say the new map increases the number of Senate districts in Virginia with black majorities to six from five and is necessary to shield the state from lawsuits under federal civil rights law. But Democrats are furious that the map also dilutes the party’s power by removing blacks from as many as a dozen districts; and under the guise of bowing to the Voting Rights Act, they say, it would pack blacks in fewer districts over all.“This was nothing more than what I call plantation politics,” said Senator Donald McEachin, the chairman of the Democratic caucus.The issue has reintroduced partisan rancor in the State Senate, which is evenly split, 20 to 20, between the parties. Many Virginia lawmakers had hoped to avoid conflict after last year’s divisions over a bill requiring ultrasounds for women seeking abortions cast a harsh light on the state nationally.One displeased official is Gov. Bob McDonnell, a Republican, who needs Democratic support as he seeks to enact ambitious proposals on transportation and education in his last year in office. “This is not an issue that I advocated,” Mr. McDonnell told reporters on Tuesday. “I certainly don’t think that’s a good way to do business.”Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling also opposed his party’s move. “He is concerned that it could create a hyperpartisan atmosphere,” said Mr. Bolling’s spokeswoman, Ibbie Hedrick.Republicans who pushed through the map said it was needed to right historic wrongs. Although 19 percent of Virginia’s population is black, according to the census, and President Obama carried the state twice, only 5 of the 40 state senators are black. All represent districts drawn with black majorities in 1991. Since then, no other district has sent an African-American to the Senate.The leader of the new effort, Senator John C. Watkins, said that in creating a sixth district in Southern Virginia with a black majority, the state would be protected from litigation under the Voting Rights Act. “No one can dispute that racially polarized voting is present in Virginia,” Mr. Watkins said on the Senate floor on Monday, according to a transcript of the proceedings.Senator Richard L. Saslaw, the Democratic minority leader, used an expletive to describe Republican concerns for black voters. He said Republicans blocked efforts in 2011 to create a new Congressional district with a high percentage of blacks.Mr. Saslaw, who is known for not holding back, said that on the Senate floor he compared the Republican move to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Both Republicans and Democrats, he said, have traditionally agreed to map districts in the back room to protect incumbents.“When I did the redistricting I went to every single Republican, except four or five, and gave them the districts they wanted,” he said of the effort he led in 2011. By contrast, he said, the new map “guts about a dozen of our senators.”Democrats say the extensive changes passed by Republicans, which are now before the legislature’s lower chamber, the House of Delegates, where Republicans hold a supermajority, violate the state’s Constitution. They foresee a lengthy court fight if the map is adopted. Before then, however, it must get past the governor, not a sure bet at all.As for Mr. Marsh, who missed the vote, he rejected any notion that Republicans were acting in African-Americans’ interests. He called the plan “shameful.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/world/americas/venezuela-officials-say-plot-targeted-vice-president.html,"Officials said Wednesday that they had uncovered a plot to assassinate the top two government figures who have been running the country during the absence of the cancer-stricken President Hugo Chávez. Justice Minister Néstor Reverol said “the Venezuelan ultraright in complicity with the ultraright outside the country” were behind a plot to kill the two officials, Vice President Nicolás Maduro and the National Assembly president, Diosdado Cabello. Speaking later at a pro-government rally, Mr. Maduro mentioned the plot allegations and promised to use a “hard hand against the right-wing conspiracy.” Mr. Reverol said that security had been increased."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/world/middleeast/netanyahu-obama-ties-may-thaw-after-israel-election.html,"WASHINGTON — For President Obama, whose relationship with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has often resembled that of a couple trapped in a loveless marriage, the last three months must have offered some grim satisfaction.In November, Mr. Obama won re-election over Mitt Romney, who had been the not-so-subtle favorite of Mr. Netanyahu. Then on Tuesday, Mr. Netanyahu stumbled in his own re-election bid, with his Likud Party holding enough seats in Parliament to keep him in office but falling far short of expectations in the face of surging centrist voters.Still, there was no crowing at the White House, at least in public, as the returns flowed in from Israel. Administration officials on Wednesday were reluctant to comment on how Mr. Netanyahu’s setback may affect his relations with Mr. Obama, especially since the Israeli leader has not yet begun the work of cobbling together a governing coalition.As they sifted through the implications, analysts said there was more than vindication for Mr. Obama in Israel’s new political landscape.Mr. Netanyahu’s weakened position could set the stage for, if not a “reset,” to use the administration’s well-worn phrase, then an improvement in his ties with the president.If, as some analysts expect, Mr. Netanyahu seeks to put together a center-right coalition that includes Yair Lapid, whose Yesh Atid party won 19 seats in the 120-seat Parliament, it could sand away the roughest edges of Mr. Netanyahu’s existing right-wing coalition.Mr. Lapid could push a new government in directions that would ease longstanding sources of tension with Mr. Obama. For example, he is more interested in creating jobs and providing housing than in expanding construction of Jewish settlements in the West Bank, a recurring source of friction between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu.With Ehud Barak, a hawkish former general, leaving the Defense Ministry, Mr. Netanyahu may be under less pressure to consider a unilateral strike on Iran over its nuclear program. That would be a relief to the White House, which has had to plead with the Israelis for patience while it pursues a last-ditch diplomatic effort with Tehran.“A weaker Bibi heading a government with some centrists was the best outcome the White House could have hoped for,” said Aaron David Miller, a longtime Middle East negotiator, using Mr. Netanyahu’s nickname. “It gives them a better chance to avoid war with the Iranian mullahs and preserve the chance of a peace with the Palestinians.”The most optimistic outcome, Mr. Miller said, would be a kind of “odd couple” relationship between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu, in which they retain their differences over issues like settlements, but learn to manage them more skillfully.That would be no small step, given the mutual suspicion that has suffused their relationship. White House officials alternately fumed and rolled their eyes during the presidential campaign when Mr. Netanyahu appeared to tilt toward Mr. Romney, inviting him to dinner at his home during the Republican candidate’s visit to Jerusalem last July.Mr. Obama, members of the Likud Party believe, returned the favor during the Israeli election when Jeffrey Goldberg, an American journalist who writes frequently about Israel, reported that the president had disparaged Mr. Netanyahu after the Israeli government announced plans for settlements in a contested area of the West Bank known as E1.Mr. Goldberg quoted Mr. Obama as saying repeatedly, “Israel doesn’t know what its own best interests are.” The White House did not confirm or deny Mr. Obama’s comments.But days before the election, Mr. Netanyahu shot back that “only Israeli citizens will be the ones who determine who faithfully represents the vital interests of Israel” — a vivid reminder of his chilly relationship with the leader of Israel’s most important ally.While in the past Israeli leaders — including Mr. Netanyahu himself during a previous stint as prime minister — have been punished by Israeli voters for mismanaging their relationships with American presidents, analysts were reluctant to attribute too much of his troubles to Mr. Obama, given the complexities of an election that surprised even the experts.Still, as Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel, put it, “the Israeli public cares about the relationship, and it didn’t help that he mishandled it, and there was a reminder of how badly he mishandled it on the eve of the election.”Among the intriguing questions, Mr. Indyk said, is whether Mr. Lapid would insist on concessions for joining a coalition with Mr. Netanyahu, like a freeze in settlement construction. While Mr. Lapid’s party has put its emphasis on concerns like jobs and housing, taking a stand on settlements would signal a shift from the right’s agenda.Almost no one predicts that a new Israeli government will suddenly allow Mr. Obama to rekindle his first-term goal of a peace agreement between the Israelis and Palestinians. Mr. Lapid’s party did not score its victory by pushing to revive long-moribund peace talks. The political climate on both sides remains hostile to such an effort.Nor, after the frustrations of his first term, does Mr. Obama appear any more likely to invest heavily in Middle East peacemaking. The president scarcely mentions the subject these days.While Mr. Indyk said that Senator John Kerry, the Massachusetts Democrat who has been nominated to succeed Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, would make a game effort to preserve the two-state solution, he is no more likely to achieve a breakthrough than Mrs. Clinton did.Mr. Miller, now at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars, said he had rarely seen a relationship as persistently dysfunctional as that between Mr. Obama and Mr. Netanyahu. A resounding Netanyahu victory would only have exacerbated those strains.Now, though, in the wake of his deflating victory, Mr. Netanyahu may have the chance to mend fences, Mr. Miller said.“The good news for Bibi, if he manages to put it together, is that a broader government would ease tensions and make the next four years much less rocky,” he said. “Netanyahu will be able to preside over a much more functional relationship with the United States.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/us/politics/bipartisan-filibuster-deal-is-taking-shape-in-senate.html,"WASHINGTON — Senate Democratic and Republican leaders are nearing an agreement on new limits to the filibuster, an effort to speed action in the often-clogged chamber by prohibiting senators from using a common tactic to slow the legislative process.Lawmakers and aides said the new rules, which both sides were preparing to announce on Thursday, would end the use of a procedural tactic that forces the majority party — Democrats currently — to marshal 60 votes to even bring a bill to the floor, sometimes killing it before it ever gets debated.The practice of blocking a procedural step known as a motion to proceed, which must be cleared before a bill can advance to the Senate floor, has been used repeatedly and with increasing frequency by Republicans, who have been in the minority since 2007. In return for agreement, Republicans wrested a major concession from the majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, who has guaranteed that he will allow Republicans to offer two amendments.The changes will surely disappoint reformers who were pushing for more sweeping revisions to rein in the filibuster, once a rarely used legislative tool. It will not include, for instance, a requirement that senators be present on the Senate floor when they want to block a bill from coming to a vote, continuing the practice of allowing them to filibuster in absentia. And opponents would still have the opportunity to filibuster a final vote on any legislation, thwarting its passage without 60 votes.Though Mr. Reid has threatened to use his majority to push through changes if Republicans do not compromise, veteran lawmakers in both parties have historically been reluctant to force drastic changes in Senate rules, fearing they could boomerang on them if they return to the minority.Senate negotiators continued to work out the final parameters of a compromise Wednesday, but members of both parties said the general framework of a deal was close to being finished. Remaining sticking points included how the filibuster could be applied to the president’s judicial nominations.Some Senators expressed relief that they finally appeared headed toward a resolution on one of the main issues that helped make the last Congress, the 112th, unproductive and inefficient.“I think this would be a real boost towards ending the gridlock which has bedeviled us,” said Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat.“The unique thing about the Senate is we’re supposed to debate — frequently and at length. And we’re supposed to be deliberative,” he added. “It’s been allowed, I believe, to decline in that regard.”Mr. Levin echoed a sentiment that has been increasingly common among members of both parties: because of arcane parliamentary rules exploited by both parties, senators are not able to do the work they were elected to carry out.Democrats have long complained that Republican obstruction has kept even the most routine measures from being dealt with in a timely manner. The number of times a motion for cloture has been filed — a procedure that begins a vote to end a filibuster — in the 112th Congress was 115. In the 111th Congress it was 137, more than double the number from when Democrats were in the minority during the early 2000s.In turn, Republicans say they have been forced to block bills because of Mr. Reid’s refusal to allow amendments on bills once they reach the floor, and his insistence that bills often bypass the committee process, tactics that prevent them from having much of a meaningful role in shaping legislation.“It’s important for us as Republicans to be able to offer amendments,” said Senator John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican who worked on a bipartisan filibuster compromise along with Mr. Levin and Senators Charles E. Schumer of New York and Benjamin L. Cardin of Maryland, Mark Pryor of Arkansas, all Democrats, and the Republicans Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and John McCain of Arizona.Added Mr. Barrasso: “I hope we’re more functional. I want the body to function.”Democrats said Thursday that it appeared likely the deal would include one key provision to help accelerate the standard daylong waiting period between the time a successful vote to end a filibuster is taken and the final vote on the bill occurs. Currently senators can trigger that waiting period without even being in Washington.But Mr. Levin said Wednesday that Mr. Reid would now require that senators actually be present and make the case on the floor.“Reid believes this strongly,” Mr. Levin said. “You want to filibuster, you’re going to have to come here and do it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/nyregion/syracuses-mayor-miner-irritates-cuomo-over-state-aid-to-cities.html,"ALBANY — Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse earned her political chops from the first Governor Cuomo, whom she served as a regional representative and speaks of with reverence.Like any good Cuomo hand, she relishes a fight. And now she might have one with the second Governor Cuomo.On Wednesday, Mayor Miner and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, both Democrats, continued to skirmish over the governor’s approach to struggling municipalities, highlighting what had been largely behind-the-scenes frustrations among some prominent local leaders about the governor’s strategy to deal with their problems.On Tuesday, in a speech to the Legislature, the governor said there would be no bailouts for municipalities, stating, “We don’t have the money.”A few hours later, Ms. Miner took aim at the governor’s budget, saying it raised “more questions than answers.” She was particularly critical of a new proposal allowing municipalities to push their pension costs into the future — the second such state plan in the last half-decade — saying that it amounted to continuing to kick the can down the road, and asking, “Isn’t this what got states like Illinois in trouble?”The governor wasted little time in firing back.On Wednesday, Lt. Gov. Robert Duffy traveled to Syracuse for a previously scheduled meeting with journalists at The Post-Standard of Syracuse.At that meeting, Mr. Duffy suggested he had an option in mind: “I would say to the mayor, if this is not sufficient, then I would suggest one viable option she would have is to request a financial control board,” he said — which would assume many of the mayor’s powers.That drew a sharp response from Ms. Miner.“I think that’s a false choice, to say to the people of New York State you either have to borrow more or give up democratic control of your city,” she said in an interview.Ms. Miner, 42, who was elected mayor in 2009, is known to be an ambitious politician with a combative nature that has led to clashes with fellow Democrats on her city’s Common Council. But her comments were a rare expression of public dissent among Democrats, since the governor is well known to disdain public displays of disaffection.Only last week, he instructed local party officials that he wanted the state Democratic Party to be a “tighter” ship. He could have hardly had Ms. Miner’s comments in mind — he handpicked her as co-chairwoman of the state Democratic Party.But other local leaders also said that a broader strategy would help.“Giving us new ways to borrow money, it’s appreciated, and it is a life preserver,” said Mayor Michael Spano of Yonkers. “But it’s not going to solve our problems.”Mr. Spano has been involved in a series of talks with Ms. Miner and other prominent mayors about common problems, talks that have not always been embraced by the governor’s staff.“He’s a tough guy, you know?” Mr. Spano said of his discussions with the governor. “You’ve got to respect that. He’s a tough guy from the big city; I’m a tough guy from a big city — not as big as the one he’s from.”“We all are set on a path, and at the end of this path, there’s going to be a day of reckoning where we are no longer going to be able to tax our way, cut our way or borrow our way out of our problems,” Mr. Spano said. “And when that day comes, what are we going to do?”The governor, for his part, has hewed to a patchwork approach. While he is creating a task force to aid municipalities that have to restructure their finances and has taken on a portion of local Medicaid costs, he has also emphasized steps aimed at deferring pain — in addition to the pension plan, he has allowed some municipalities to accelerate future state aid payments, receiving more now and less later.But the governor also inevitably hears pleas by mayors as entreaties for more money.“The answer cannot be, my friends, that every municipality in the state that has a financial problem, they’re going to come to Albany and ask for a check,” Mr. Cuomo said Tuesday in a speech to the Legislature. “If there is a fundamental economic inequity in that corporation — that public corporation — resolve the inequity,” he added. “Don’t subsidize it year after year after year.”Patrick M. Maglieri, an expert in municipal law at Harris Beach, said, “I think probably the frustration is that this is nibbling at the edges and dealing with the cash-flow issues that municipalities are facing short term, but not running to the heart of the structural issues they face.”“These are aging cities with aging population and aging infrastructure that are consuming a greater percentage of their revenues, and coupled with that is the declining tax base,” he added.Ms. Miner insisted on Wednesday that mayors were not coming to Albany with their hand out, but asking for a more comprehensive approach to their shared problems. “What we want is a good policy solution to this structural problem,” she said. “Over the next two years, the city of Syracuse will not be able to close its gap on its own.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/opinion/israels-election.html,"The political opponents of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel were ecstatic at his apparent losses in Tuesday’s elections. Haaretz, the left-leaning newspaper, called it a vote of no confidence that showed Mr. Netanyahu has “failed in the political sphere, the foreign policy sphere and the socioeconomic sphere.”We wish we were as certain of what it means.Mr. Netanyahu is weakened and his political future less certain, but he is still expected to be prime minister after the postelection horse trading is done.The television celebrity Yair Lapid surprised many people by leading his party, Yesh Atid, to second place behind Mr. Netanyahu’s conservative Likud-Beiteinu ticket, taking 19 of Parliament’s 120 seats. Likud-Beiteinu won 31 seats, down from the 42 seats the parties held before. Mr. Lapid has indicated a willingness to form a coalition with Mr. Netanyahu, but other parties could also be enlisted in that effort. That could mean more centrist leaders joining Mr. Netanyahu and tempering his hard-right line on talks with the Palestinians and other issues, but it could also mean more hard-liners. The rejection of religious parties by an overwhelming majority of voters sends a signal that Israelis are tired of sectarian divisiveness and the often-oppressive policies that religious leaders have championed.We wish Mr. Lapid’s election success constituted an unambiguous endorsement of vigorous peace talks, but voters in exit polls said they were more focused on domestic issues. Even though Mr. Netanyahu did worse than predicted, voters still gave the most seats to his ticket, which was purged of some moderates in favor of more right-wing candidates.Still, there is a reason to hope that the new government could be more receptive to a peace initiative. The vote suggests that if it is not, Israelis may give even more support next time to a centrist coalition not led by Mr. Netanyahu. Mr. Lapid has been skeptical of the Palestinian leadership’s willingness to negotiate and has not made peace talks a priority. But he supports a two-state solution and renewing peace talks that have been frozen for four years.Although he also has endorsed a two-state solution, Mr. Netanyahu has so aggressively built new settlements that it soon may be impossible to create a contiguous Palestinian state. His push has triggered international condemnation and strained relations with Washington.Mr. Lapid is not the only new force in Israeli politics. Naftali Bennett, a settlement advocate and leader of a religious-Zionist party, is even more hard-line toward the Palestinians than Mr. Netanyahu. His party did worse than some had predicted, winning only 11 seats, but he remains a vocal force against the Palestinians.Mr. Bennett has said that he would do everything in his power to make sure Palestinians never get a state. Such talk endangers Israel’s security by ensuring permanent occupation of the West Bank. It insults Palestinians who rejected violence and recognized Israel’s right to exist as part of the 1993 Oslo Accords. It is no vision for Israel’s future. The White House on Wednesday renewed its call for peace talks to resume. This won’t mean much if President Obama is not ready to invest political capital in a new diplomatic initiative. Unlike the bungled effort in his first term, though, he needs to carefully prepare the political ground, including making his first trip to Israel as president and explaining to the Israeli people how any peace plan will enhance their security."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/world/middleeast/jordanians-vote-in-first-parliament-elections-since-protests.html,"MULEIH, Jordan — Two years ago, Mohamed al-Snaid organized laborers to demonstrate against poor working conditions, helping to start a movement that spread throughout the country and gave voice to a festering anger that has shaken the rule of King Abdullah II.On Wednesday, Mr. Snaid took on a very different role, as a candidate in Jordan’s first parliamentary elections since the start of the unrest. He ran despite a boycott of the election by the many members of the protest movement, Hirak, who regard the vote as a public relations exercise by the king and who say that previous Parliaments were weak and unrepresentative.Standing outside a polling station, Mr. Snaid said that after debating whether to join the boycott, he decided that the best place to fight corruption and economic inequality was from inside the system. Besides, the king asked personally.“He told us to participate to help him with reform,” Mr. Snaid said.The lines were short, especially in Amman, the capital, but officials said early results showed that 56 percent of the 2.3 million voters who registered turned out, despite the boycott. There were numerous reports of vote-buying but no immediate signs of widespread fraud, which would itself represent a change from charges of interference leveled against the Jordanian authorities in recent parliamentary elections.In the most serious challenge to the credibility of the elections, the country’s main opposition group, the Islamic Action Front, which is affiliated with the Muslim Brotherhood, has joined the boycott, increasing the chances that the election will be followed by more unrest. The group’s leaders have argued that the election law is flawed and underrepresents cities, where most Jordanians live — and where the Brotherhood counts on support, including among Jordanians of Palestinian descent, a majority of the nation’s population.Jordanians approached the polls with trepidation on Wednesday, with some saying that the appearance of so many former members of Parliament on the ballot gave them little faith that the election would provide meaningful change. King Abdullah, a crucial American ally, has insisted that amendments to the election law and other changes would help usher in a new era of pluralism, although many here see him as relying on the vote to fend off the anger in the streets.“We don’t want old faces. We tried that,” said Khalid Hammad, 28, a lawyer who voted in Amman, in support of a friend, a fellow lawyer who was a first-time candidate. Mr. Hammad said that previous Parliaments had been derided for failing to fight corruption or to grapple with demands for social justice“We are worried,” he said. “We can help Jordan not go the same way as Syria and Egypt.”In all, 1,425 candidates were running for 150 seats, up from 120, in the lower house — an election law modification that was intended to quiet complaints about a system that rewarded local power brokers. They were often members of powerful tribes rather than national parties. But the Brotherhood and other opposition groups complained that the new law did not go far enough.At polling stations, voters seemed to be reverting to patterns that had enfeebled Parliament in the past: ignoring issues while voting for friends, relatives or members of their tribe. And the ballot included several candidates who were arrested on bribery charges in the days before the election."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/opinion/hubris-in-virginia.html,"The dark art of statehouse gerrymandering reached a new low in Virginia this week. Senate Republicans in Richmond used the absence of a Democratic member, who traveled to the presidential inauguration, to ram through a surprise redistricting map patently designed to aid the G.O.P.’s grab for majority power in the next election.The chamber is divided 20-20 between the parties. A redistricting plan had been adopted after the 2010 census. But no sooner had Senator Henry Marsh III, a black civil rights leader, left for the inauguration on Martin Luther King’s Birthday than the Republicans pounced like street thugs to limit debate to 30 minutes and pass their shabbily partisan ploy by a vote of 20 to 19.Like most states, the Virginia commonwealth has a long history of political eye-gouging in the pursuit of voting maps that boost the careers of one party’s members while keeping voters in the dark. But the Republicans’ blitzkrieg was breathtaking as they dredged up an innocuous House bill, grafted their remapping scheme onto it, and rushed it to the floor without any notice to the public.The Republican House is expected to approve the changes, which would make eight of the state’s 40 Senate districts — including six held by Democrats — more heavily Republican. At the same time, more Democrats would be packed into three solidly Democratic districts. Republicans laughably argued that the remapping was needed to meet civil rights laws for fairer minority representation — this despite the party’s statehouse history of blocking Congressional redistricting plans bolstering minorities.The Senate maneuver created such instant scandal that even the Republican governor, Robert McDonnell, had to admit, “I certainly don’t think that’s a good way to do business.” He can best make his point by vetoing the remapping as a piratical exercise in legislative hubris."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/world/europe/czech-prince-schwarzenberg-runs-a-punk-campaign.html,"PRAGUE — His face stares out from campaign posters in music clubs and hip cafes, a 75-year-old prince retooled as a punk rocker with a hot pink mohawk and lofty presidential ambitions.As Czechs head to the polls in presidential elections on Friday and Saturday, advisers to the prince, Karel Schwarzenberg, who is also the Czech Republic’s foreign minister, hope that the jarring image — modeled on a Sex Pistols album cover — will resonate with young voters and help catapult him to Prague Castle, the office of the president.Quick to disarm anyone who might dismiss him as fusty, Mr. Schwarzenberg, whose full name and title in German is Karel Johannes Nepomuk Joseph Norbert Friedrich Antonius Wratislaw Menas Fürst zu Schwarzenberg, says he prefers Karel.Mr. Schwarzenberg, whose family once ranked among the wealthiest aristocrats in Europe, is a pro-European member of the center-right governing coalition. He has emerged as a surprisingly strong contender in the race to succeed President Vaclav Klaus, who has equated the European Union with the former Soviet bloc.Although the Czech presidency is largely a ceremonial post, it carries deep moral authority. The president also wields some influence in foreign policy, makes appointments to the central bank and approves the appointment of judges.Mr. Schwarzenberg is battling Milos Zeman, 68, the front-runner, a leftist former prime minister who narrowly beat him in the first round of the elections, gaining 24.2 percent of the vote against 23.4 percent for Mr. Schwarzenberg, who more than doubled his predicted share.David Cerny, a Czech artist who created the punk-prince image and is a campaign adviser, said the rebranding was an appeal to younger Czechs who still regarded Mr. Schwarzenberg as an old and conservative uncle. “The depiction of Karel as a punk was meant to be ironic, but it is also fitting, as Karel has always been a rebel, stubborn and determined, an indestructible bulldozer,” Mr. Cerny said.The elections, the first direct vote for president here, signal the end of an era, that of the two Vaclavs — Havel and Klaus — who have dominated Czech politics for the past two decades. Vaclav Havel, the idealist-dreamer and playwright who led the Velvet Revolution in 1989 before becoming the first post-Communist president, died in late 2011. Mr. Klaus, his nemesis, steps down in March after two five-year terms.“We are seeing the end of the era of the giant and unquestioned names in Czech politics,” said Erik Tabery, a leading journalist. “The country is in a bad mood because of a feeling that more than two decades after the revolution, things should be better than they are.”Although the Czech Republic has not suffered from the same sharp economic pain as the southern European economies, it has been buffeted by 9.4 percent unemployment, weak economic growth and a series of corruption scandals.Against that backdrop, the avuncular and urbane Mr. Schwarzenberg has emerged as a conciliatory candidate of unexpectedly wide appeal. Yet he has several challenges to overcome, including his exile to Austria during the Communist period, which some critics, including Mr. Klaus, have seized on to dismiss him as a foreigner. Therese, his Austrian wife, does not speak Czech.He himself still speaks the somewhat archaic Czech of his childhood and has been criticized for incoherence and for dozing off during debates. (His aides say he closes his eyes when faced with strong spotlights.)That sort of haziness extends to his political career, in the minds of his critics, who portray him as a political opportunist who has flip-flopped between parties in the pursuit of power.“He has been linked to three or four different parties on both left and right, from Greens to conservatives, in the aim of attaining high office,” said Tomas Jirsa, former vice chairman of a national conservative youth group. “Today he is a conservative, but who knows tomorrow?”At best, Mr. Jirsa said, Mr. Schwarzenberg has shown a desire to emulate his previous boss, Mr. Havel, and transcend ideology. But that, he says, is politically naïve.Mr. Schwarzenberg’s life has been deeply influenced by what he has described as his involuntary departure from Czechoslovakia in 1948, when his family fled its castle in Prague after the Communists took over.Yet Mr. Schwarzenberg never lost a strong sense of civic duty to the country of his birth.While in exile in Vienna in 1984, he became president of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights and cast himself as an important liaison between the West and Czechoslovak dissidents, including Mr. Havel.After the fall of Communism in 1989, he returned to Czechoslovakia to work for Mr. Havel, offering up his glittering foreign contacts. He became a senator in 2004 and three years later foreign minister and a keen supporter of the United States.After helping found TOP 09, a conservative political party, in 2009, he became foreign minister in the current center-right coalition government of Prime Minister Petr Necas, which has been criticized for passing tough austerity measures. Mr. Schwarzenberg, however, has not always agreed with all the government’s policies. His support for the Dalai Lama and the Russian punk band Pussy Riot led Mr. Necas to warn that his advocacy could threaten Czech exports to Russia and China. But Mr. Schwarzenberg refused to back down.Such an independent streak has appealed to young people, and on a recent night at a concert in his honor, the crowd was dominated by people in their 20s.Wearing a “punk Karel” pin, Lada Bily, 25, said he was voting for Mr. Schwarzenberg, in part because his wealth would make him immune from corruption. His advanced age, he added, was no disadvantage.Mr. Schwarzenberg himself has dismissed those who have criticized his age and soporific tendencies.“I fall asleep,” he was once quoted on a billboard as saying, “when others talk nonsense.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/michael-beychok-is-political-consultant-and-handicapper-on-horse-races.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Michael Beychok is a political consultant, a first-rate one who in November helped deliver scores of victories to Democratic candidates across the nation. When he is not studying polling numbers or data points, Beychok is using this skill for another high-stakes endeavor: handicapping and gambling on horse races.He is good at it, and last year he won the $1 million first-place prize and the title handicapper of the year at the National Handicapping Championship in Las Vegas. If Beychok’s avocation was playing chess, that achievement might have earned him the title of grandmaster. Horseplayers, however, are rarely credited for what could be just as erudite a pursuit.Instead, they are either painted as Damon Runyon characters — or even branded as degenerate gamblers.“We are a misunderstood group,” Beychok, 49, said. “There is a steep learning curve to climb if you want to play the horses. It takes discipline and study. There’s nothing desperate about it.”In fact, among the 465 horseplayers scheduled to be in Las Vegas on Friday for the 14th annual championship at Treasure Island are competitors who would hardly look out of place at a Wall Street conference. They include Frank Mariani, the chief executive of the Los Angeles Lakers;  Jamie Michelson Jr., a past champion and an advertising executive from Michigan; and Mark Streiff, a Southern California financial consultant who, as the National Handicapping Tour champion, can earn a $2 million bonus if he wins the contest.To become the national handicapper of the year, competitors must build the largest bankroll from 30 win or place bets on any of the more than 150 races run at eight different racetracks.Beychok sees similarities between his day job as a political consultant and the more ethereal pursuit of picking winners at the racetrack. After all, he was first introduced to the Fair Grounds Race Course here as a teenager by a young associate in his father’s law firm. It was a guy by the name of James Carville, who became pretty famous as a strategist for President Bill Clinton.“You’re sifting through snapshots of information, projecting performance and counting noses,” Beychok said. “Both are predictive in nature.”Creativity is rewarded in elections as well as at the betting windows. In the hotly contested Missouri Senate race, Beychok was behind a “talking greeting card” that featured sound clips of the Republican candidate Todd Akin’s thoughts on what is “legitimate rape.” It helped deliver a victory to the Democrat incumbent, Senator Claire McCaskill.Likewise, in last year’s tournament, Beychok was trailing going into the final race when he heeded a hunch about a filly named Glorious Dancer running in a claiming race at Golden Gate Fields in Northern California. He believed she might be the horse doing all the running down the stretch.He was correct.When Glorious Dancer got up in the final stride to win by a nose, Beychok was the winner of a cool and life-changing $1 million.“By a nose and a dollar,” he said, referring to his margin of victory, the narrowest in the history of the tournament. “I don’t need to study eight hours a day. I’ve seen more than 100,000 races in my life. I know what I like in minutes. I like her. The key is don’t let your brain get in the way of a strong feeling.”That score did more than allow Beychok to bet with both hands on his subsequent and regular visits to the racetrack. It transformed the way that he looked at the athletes he was putting his money on.“Until then, I was a bet ’em and forget ’em player,” he said. “I just moved on to the next group of horses. But I wanted Glorious Dancer to have a good life.”So last March, Beychok claimed the filly for $6,250. Glorious Dancer notched a victory, a second and a third at Golden Gate for her new owner. When she came up with a minor injury, Beychok decided the filly had done enough for him.“We could have rested her and returned her to the races,” he said. “But I didn’t want her to get claimed away from me. I brought her back to Louisiana. ”Now, Glorious Dancer calls a farm nearby home. The Louisiana Horse Rescue Association is working with her, seeing if she might have the potential to pursue a second career as a sport horse. If not, she will live her life out on Beychok’s dime.He is not stopping there. Beychok has pledged to give 10 percent of any prize money he wins over the weekend to thoroughbred aftercare groups and has challenged his fellow competitors to do the same. He cannot guarantee another big score, but Beychok likes his chances this weekend in Las Vegas.This is his time of year. Twice before in January, he picked six straight winners to take down the Pick Six at Santa Anita Park — once for $60,000, the other for $105,000.“My mom says my biorhythms must be really good in January,” he said.Beychok has a more grounded explanation. So much of his year is focused on the first Tuesday in November, and the data needed to be crunched to get a candidate in office.“My mind’s cluttered,” he said. “It takes me a month to decompress. I make 90 percent of my salary in September and October. So now I’m a little fat. I’m not betting scared. I’m not worried about work. My brain gets out of the way of my gut.”Beychok becomes a horseplayer, pure and simple, and there is not a thing Runyonesque about him. Except he has usually “got the horse right here” more often than the next guy."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/nyregion/mark-zuckerberg-plans-fund-raiser-for-gov-christie.html,"Mark Zuckerberg likes Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.So much that Mr. Zuckerberg, a co-founder of Facebook, and his wife will hold a fund-raiser for him next month at their home in Palo Alto, Calif.The fund-raiser is another reminder of the hurdles Democrats face in attempting to defeat Mr. Christie, who faces re-election in November and is often mentioned as a leading contender for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016.Mr. Christie has increasingly tried to position himself as a kind of crossbreed politician, apart from the partisan politics that plague Washington, and able to appeal to a constituency beyond the Republican Party regulars. He took leaders of his own party to task this month when they failed to call a vote on a relief package for victims of Hurricane Sandy. His popularity has soared since the storm, even among Democrats — and apparently among at least some tech donors in Silicon Valley, where political contributions tend to flow toward more liberal causes.A spokeswoman for Mr. Zuckerberg, who is the company’s chief executive, said he and his wife admired the governor’s work on education policy — Mr. Christie has pushed for vouchers, championed a new state law weakening tenure in public schools, and signed a contract with the teachers union in the state-run Newark schools that will allow performance bonuses. He also signed a law requiring teachers, among other public employees, to pay more toward their pension and benefits.Mr. Zuckerberg showed his interest in education with a $100 million donation to the Newark schools in 2010. But he stood alongside a Democrat, Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, as well as Mr. Christie to make that announcement. And he has made few political contributions — federal records show only a $10,000 donation to Facebook’s political action committee.Mike DuHaime, Mr. Christie’s chief political consultant, said the two men met in 2010, before Mr. Zuckerberg’s pledge to the Newark schools, became fast friends and have kept in touch. “Governor Christie was instrumental in giving Mark the confidence that the money in Newark was going to be used wisely,” Mr. DuHaime said.“I think it demonstrates the kind of broad appeal that he has and support that he has, and part of it is taking on education reform. People took notice that the governor stood up and did the right thing.”The Democratic Governors’ Association, which might be expected to dispute that characterization of some of Mr. Christie’s education policies, started an online petition Thursday calling on Mr. Zuckerberg to cancel the fund-raiser for “right-wing Republican darling Chris Christie.”Mr. Christie has raised more than $2 million for his re-election, and announced that he would opt not to take public matching money for the primary, which would have required him to limit spending in the early stage of the race to $5 million. Some Democrats have said they need to raise close to $50 million to beat him. The only declared Democratic challenger so far, State Senator Barbara Buono, has raised about $250,000. (Mr. Booker, who was considered a favorite to challenge Mr. Christie, announced his interest in running for Senate in 2014 instead.)"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/politics/gop-considers-strategy-from-obamas-election-campaign.html,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — As Republican leaders gathered here on Thursday to consider how to rebuild their party, President Obama was at the center of the conversation. But the sharp criticism directed at him was replaced by something new: envy over his campaign.The Republican National Committee is reviewing the party’s deficiencies, particularly in technology and grass-roots organizing, that contributed to Mitt Romney’s sound defeat last year. The excuses and grievances that several top Republicans offered up after the election have been supplanted by pledges to strengthen the party.“We need to get people organized and learn from what Obama did,” said Mike Duncan, a former national party chairman who now represents Kentucky on the committee. “We’ve got to reverse engineer what they did and leapfrog to the next cycle.”As Republicans look for a path to victory, party officials from all 50 states convened here at the winter meeting of the Republican National Committee. There was less finger-pointing than soul-searching, and Republican leaders acknowledged the urgent need to make the party more welcoming to a broader cross-section of Americans, particularly women, Hispanics and blacks.“The Republican Party does not need to change our principles, but we might need to change just about everything else we are doing,” said Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana. It was time, he said, “to recalibrate the compass of conservatism.”There was more discussion about the challenges facing Republicans than the solutions. But in interviews, Republican officials from across the country said a new tone is needed, and they called on the party to take cues from its 30 governors rather than become consumed by Republicans’ differences in Washington.Tensions remain high among the Tea Party movement, the Republican establishment and other segments of the party, who are at odds over fiscal issues and taxes in Congress. Immigration policy and other measures also threaten to divide the party in the 2014 midterm elections, when Republicans are seeking to keep their House majority and win back the Senate.“The tone does have to change,” said Gov. Pat McCrory of North Carolina, who called for “a tone of respecting the other side’s opinion.” He said Republicans also should not bow to all viewpoints inside the party, declaring, “When you try to appease everyone, you satisfy no one.”A five-member panel of the Republican National Committee, known as the Growth and Opportunity Project, is scheduled to release a report in March outlining recommendations for strengthening the party, with the primary goal to win the White House in 2016. The group is reviewing how Republicans fell short last year and how the Republican primaries might have weakened Mr. Romney.Sally Bradshaw, a party strategist in Florida who is an adviser to former Gov. Jeb Bush, said Republicans needed to recruit stronger and more diverse candidates to win races. Her assignment on the panel includes a review of how Republicans and their get-out-the-vote operation were overwhelmed by the Obama campaign.“I think you’re going to see a very renewed, aggressive effort by this party to put on a different face,” Ms. Bradshaw said. “We are going to go into areas that we do not go into and see folks that we do not see.”Henry Barbour, a member of the Republican National Committee from Mississippi who is also on the panel, said the party should not dilute its conservative values, but it needed to broaden its appeal to compete with Democrats. “We did get whipped in the presidential election, and that’s not something that is taken lightly,” Mr. Barbour said. “The demographic changes in America are real, and they are a wake-up call to the Republican Party.”Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker, who competed with Mr. Romney for the Republican presidential nomination, said that the party had been “outmaneuvered” by the Obama campaign and that its ideas were not creative enough.He held court with committee members — and reporters — here on Thursday and said Republicans were responsible for their own fate. “A lot of Republicans, frankly, spent the last two years saying, ‘Oh, gee, we don’t have to do much because after Obama loses we’ll work with the new Republican president,’ ” Mr. Gingrich said. “Well, that world ain’t there, so now they have to make adjustments. They’ve got to understand that this is a different game.”Despite the party’s divisions and its disappointment about losing the White House and seats in both the House and Senate, the 168-member committee is poised to re-elect its chairman, Reince Priebus, to a second term on Friday. In 2011, Mr. Priebus inherited a party that was deeply in debt, but he has turned around the committee’s finances, which members said explained why he had no serious opposition.Mr. Priebus said he would lead a Republican rebuilding effort in all 50 states rather than simply focus on battleground states. In Congressional races next year, he said, the party would try to improve its standing with voters who have shied away from Republicans.“To those who have left the party, we want to earn your trust again,” Mr. Priebus will say in his acceptance speech on Friday, according to excerpts released by his aides. “To those who have yet to join us, we welcome you, with open doors and open arms.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/with-california-rebounding-governor-pushes-big-projects.html,"SACRAMENTO — Emboldened by a brighter fiscal horizon, Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday recommitted himself to two ambitious projects, a high-speed rail line and a huge water tunnel system, in an optimistic State of the State speech that sought to secure California’s long-term future as well as the three-term governor’s legacy.Grasping at California’s vision of itself as a land of opportunity and a model for the rest of the nation, Mr. Brown said the state was rebounding financially after a difficult period. In a speech citing sources as varied as the Bible, Montaigne and Yeats, Mr. Brown said the state’s budget was now sound, but he also warned of profligacy, a remark that seemed directed at the Democratic lawmakers listening to him in the State Capitol here.“The message this year is clear: California has once again confounded our critics. We have wrought in just two years a solid and enduring budget,” Mr. Brown, a Democrat, said in his third State of the State address since returning to office in 2011. “Against those who take pleasure, singing of our demise, California did the impossible.”Mr. Brown spoke of wanting to reform school financing by empowering local school districts, and of continuing to lead efforts to fight climate change, like the cap-and-trade system for carbon emissions that went into effect recently.Recalling the big infrastructure projects in the state’s past, Mr. Brown also voiced strong support for two big-ticket items that have drawn strong opposition: a bullet train that would eventually link Los Angeles and the Bay Area, and two tunnels that would funnel water directly from Northern California to more populated areas in the south.“The London Olympics lasted a short while and cost $14 billion, about the same cost as this project,” he said of the tunnels. “But this project will serve California for hundreds of years.”Mr. Brown’s speech came at what many are describing as a turning point for California after years of economic turmoil. The state’s economy is continuing to show signs of strengthening, with job growth and a housing market revival.Fiscally, after years of ballooning budget deficits, the state is now projecting a balanced budget. In November, Mr. Brown surprised many by winning a hard-fought campaign to pass Proposition 30, a temporary tax surcharge that will pour $6 billion a year into the state treasury for the next seven years.Still, Mr. Brown has repeatedly warned about the need to control spending. With Democrats now having supermajorities in the Senate and the Assembly, they can pass tax increases unilaterally. As experts predict that Democratic legislators will face pressure to increase spending, many are now describing Mr. Brown, long known as “Governor Moonbeam” for his eccentricities, as the only adult in the room.Citing the story of Genesis and Pharaoh’s dream of seven cows, he said: “The people have given us seven years of extra taxes. Let us follow the wisdom of Joseph, pay down our debts and store up reserves against the leaner times that will surely come.”In interviews, Mr. Brown, who served two terms as governor from 1975 to 1983, has brushed aside talk of his legacy. But in recent months, Mr. Brown, 74, who was treated recently for prostate cancer, has spoken about his mortality, mentioning the death of a close friend.“This is my 11th year in the job, and I have never been more excited,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/politics/kerry-links-economic-and-foreign-policy-at-hearing.html,"WASHINGTON — Senator John Kerry said at his confirmation hearing for the post of secretary of state on Thursday that the top priority of the United States should be getting its fiscal house in order.“Foreign policy is economic policy,” he said. “It is urgent that we show people in the rest of the world that we can get our business done in an effective and timely way.”A day after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton jousted with Republican members of the panel, Mr. Kerry received a generally friendly reception from the committee he led for the past four years.Senator John McCain, a fellow Vietnam veteran who has been sharply critical of the Obama administration’s handling of the September attack in Benghazi and of its policy on Syria, endorsed Mr. Kerry before he began to testify.In a nearly four-hour hearing, Mr. Kerry displayed his familiarity with a broad range of issues but presented no new ideas on how to make headway on the vexing foreign policy problems that he will inherit if he is confirmed, as expected.On Iran, Mr. Kerry said that he was committed to seeking a diplomatic solution over Iran’s nuclear program, while alluding to the option to use military force if a negotiated solution could not be reached.“Our policy is not containment,” he said. “It is prevention, and the clock is ticking.”On Syria, Mr. Kerry defended his effort to engage President Bashar al-Assad of Syria during the early months of the Obama administration, asserting that Syria’s growing population gave it a reason to seek better ties with the United States.“He wanted to try to find some way to reach out to the West and see if there was some kind of an accommodation,” Mr. Kerry said of Mr. Assad. “History caught up to us.”Mr. Kerry said that he thought Mr. Assad would not survive as Syria’s leader much longer. “The time is ticking,” he said.That did not satisfy Mr. McCain, who noted that the number of refugees was growing and urged that the United States provide arms to the rebels.“We’ve had a lot of hearings; we haven’t done anything,” Mr. McCain said.“I have complete understanding of where you are coming from on this,” Mr. Kerry responded, adding that the best outcome would “find some track that changed the equation and the calculation of Assad.”Rattling off a long list of factors that made such an outcome difficult to achieve, he said he wanted to have a broader dialogue with the Congress on policy options. “We’re going to have to get our heads together, regardless of party,” Mr. Kerry said, “and figure out how we come up with an equation that is workable.”On arms control, Mr. Kerry made clear that he thought the proposal to eliminate all nuclear weapons was a “goal” that could take centuries to achieve and that the United States had no choice but to rely on nuclear deterrence in the meantime.On Russia, Mr. Kerry acknowledged that relations had “slid backwards a little bit in the last couple of years,” but said he would try to make progress.On Pakistan, Mr. Kerry said he had talked to Pakistani leaders about the Pakistani doctor who has been imprisoned for assisting the C.I.A.’s effort to track Osama bin Laden.“That bothers every American,” said Mr. Kerry, who said that he was nonetheless opposed to cutting aid. “We need to build our relationship with the Pakistanis, not diminish it,” he said.Mr. Kerry would be the first member of the committee to directly ascend to the job of secretary of state since John Sherman served beginning in 1897 under President William McKinley.To avoid the perception of a conflict of interest, Mr. Kerry did not serve as chairman of the Wednesday hearing at which Mrs. Clinton testified on Benghazi or even attend the session. Mrs. Clinton returned to the committee today to introduce her designated successor.“John is the right choice,” Mrs. Clinton said. “He has been a valued partner to this administration and to me personally.”As the proceedings continued, Senator Marco Rubio, the Florida Republican who is believed to be nursing presidential ambitions, argued for a strong American role in world affairs and complained that Mr. Obama’s foreign policy was unclear.But Mr. McCain, who recalled Mr. Kerry’s role in encouraging the normalization of relations with Vietnam, warmly praised the nominee. “Senator Kerry and I spent some time, at the Navy’s behest, in a certain Southeast Asian country,” Mr. McCain noted.The episode that appeared to most capture the mood, however, came when Senator Robert Menendez, the New Jersey Democrat who led the hearing, mistakenly referred to Mr. Kerry as “Mr. Secretary.”At that point, Mr. Kerry jokingly rose as if he was preparing to leave. “I thought this could be quick,” he said, before sitting down to resume answering questions."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/politics/rhode-island-house-votes-for-gay-marriage.html,"PROVIDENCE, R.I. — The Rhode Island House of Representatives on Thursday handily passed a bill to legalize same-sex marriage, paving the way for a showdown in the State Senate in the only New England state where it is not allowed.The measure, which would allow anyone to marry “any eligible person regardless of gender,” passed 51 to 19 after about an hour and a half of debate. But the cheers that filled the viewing gallery were quickly tempered by the bill’s uncertain future.“It’s off to the Senate now,” Dennis Byrnes of Cranston, R.I., said to a fellow onlooker. Mr. Byrnes married his husband over the border in Massachusetts.The Senate president, Teresa Paiva-Weed, is opposed to same-sex marriage, although she has committed to allow the Senate Judiciary Committee to take up the bill, which will most likely happen in the spring.Supporters of the measure, including the speaker of the House, Gordon Fox, who is gay, hoped to capitalize on the apparent national momentum: voters in Maine, Maryland and Washington State approved same-sex marriage in referendums last November. Closer to home, advocates cited the election of new lawmakers who support same-sex marriage as a reason to put the issue in front of the General Assembly just two years after civil unions were legalized here.“The time has come,” Mr. Fox said on Thursday, drawing on President Obama’s expressed support of same-sex marriage during his Inaugural Address on Monday.But even Mr. Fox conceded that though Rhode Island is in many ways a deeply Democratic state, it is probably more socially conservative than its neighboring New England states, all of which have legalized same-sex marriage.“It’s a combination of the quirkiness of our little state, the really entrenched opposition of our Catholic Church,” as well as the dominant role that the church has historically played in the state, Mr. Fox said.Both advocates for and opponents of gay marriage vowed to use grass-roots support and direct lobbying to sway the state’s senators.“The importance of getting the bill out of the House early, and over to the Senate, is key to our strategic goals,” said Ray Sullivan, the campaign director of Rhode Islanders United for Marriage, a coalition in support of the bill.Opponents, meanwhile, were confident that the measure would not succeed.“The Senate has always been a stalwart for protecting life, marriage and family in Rhode Island,” said Christopher Plante, the executive director of the National Organization for Marriage Rhode Island, the driving force behind the opposition here.“Rhode Island has bigger issues than gay marriage,” Mr. Plante said. “Our economy remains stagnant at best, in the tank at worst. We’re tied for the worst unemployment rate in the nation. There’s going to be a lot of things on the agenda between now and whenever the Senate decides to take this up.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/politics/formally-lifting-a-combat-ban-military-chiefs-stress-equal-opportunity.html,"WASHINGTON — The historic decision to lift the military’s ban on women in combat had its roots in the personal experiences in war zones of Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, both men said on Thursday. For General Dempsey, it all began in Baghdad.He had just arrived there in 2003 as a division commander, he said at a Pentagon news conference, when he clambered aboard a Humvee and asked the driver where he was from. “And I slapped the turret gunner on the leg and I said, ‘Who are you?’ “ General Dempsey recalled. “And she leaned down and said, ‘I’m Amanda.’ ”As people chortled, General Dempsey continued: “And I said, ‘Oh, O.K.’ So a female turret gunner is protecting a division commander. And it’s from that point on that I realized something had changed, and it was time to do something about it.”Almost a decade later, General Dempsey and Mr. Panetta signed a document formally rescinding a 1994 ban that restricted women from infantry, artillery, armor and other such combat roles. “Not everyone is going to be able to be a combat soldier,” Mr. Panetta said, “but everyone is entitled to a chance.”Mr. Panetta said his thinking evolved as he traveled over the past 18 months as defense secretary to Iraq and Afghanistan and across the United States speaking to women who had served. “It’s been almost 50 years since I served in the military,” he said, referring to his two years as an Army intelligence officer. “And to go out now and to see women performing the roles that they are performing and doing a great job at it, I think it just encouraged me, and I think it encouraged all of us that everybody should have a chance to perform at any mission, if they can meet the qualifications.”An aide to Mr. Panetta recalled that the defense secretary had talked extensively with a female V-22 Osprey pilot about her experiences in war zones when she flew him to visit a military ship off the coast of California. He also visited a military policewoman at Brooke Army Medical Center in San Antonio who had been shot in Afghanistan guarding a forward operating base.“When I’ve gone to Arlington to bury our dead, there is no distinction that’s made between the sacrifices of men and women in uniform,” Mr. Panetta said. “They serve, they’re wounded and they die right next to each other.”Both he and General Dempsey said the new policy was in many ways an affirmation of what they had seen was already occurring on the battlefield, where women have frequently found themselves in combat over the past decade of war in Iraq and Afghanistan — although not officially recognized for it, and therefore held back in a military in which combat experience is crucial to advancement. Mr. Panetta and General Dempsey said it was essential that the military offer equal opportunities to women and men.“They’re fighting and they’re dying together, and the time has come for our policies to reflect that reality,” Mr. Panetta said.Mr. Panetta and General Dempsey said they had met weekly for more than a year about lifting the ban and had kept President Obama informed about developments. In December, Pentagon officials said, Mr. Panetta and the Joint Chiefs reached a tentative agreement that women should be permitted in combat. Mr. Panetta thought about it over the holidays and returned early this month to receive a letter from General Dempsey dated Jan. 9 strongly recommending the change.They described the president as supportive but not intimately involved in the process. In a statement on Thursday, Mr. Obama said the change reflected “the courageous and patriotic service of women through more than two centuries of American history and the indispensable role of women in today’s military.”And while they described the decision as reflecting a consensus in the Pentagon, the move still has opponents. In the most vocal official opposition to the changes, Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, who is set to become the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, warned that some in Congress may seek legislation to limit the combat jobs open to women.“I want everyone to know that the Senate Armed Services Committee, of which I am the ranking member, will have a period to provide oversight and review,” Mr. Inhofe said in a statement. “During that time, if necessary, we will be able to introduce legislation to stop any changes we believe to be detrimental to our fighting forces and their capabilities. I suspect there will be cases where legislation becomes necessary.”Pentagon officials said that the different services would have until May 15 to submit their plans for carrying out the new policy, but that the military wanted to move as quickly as possible. Military officials said that more than 200,000 jobs were now potentially open to women, including in elite Special Operations commando units like the Navy SEALs and Delta Force. A high percentage of men fail to make the cut for those units.“I think we all believe that there will be women who can meet those standards,” General Dempsey said.If a service determines that a specialty should not be open to women, Pentagon officials said that representatives of the service would have to make the case to the defense secretary by January 2016.Officials said repeatedly that they would not lower the physical standards for women in rigorous combat jobs like the infantry, but they said they would review requirements for all the military specialties in coming months and potentially change them to keep up with, for example, advances in equipment and weaponry.“It comes down to standards,” said Gen. Robert W. Cone, the head of the Army’s Training and Doctrine Command. The future requirements for assignment to a combat job, he said, will be “more functional physical fitness tests than situps, pull-ups and two-mile runs.”For example, a woman seeking to join a tank unit might be tested on skills for lifting and loading a heavy shell, while a woman hoping to join an infantry unit might have to pass a test that includes hiking over distances with a heavy pack and dragging a wounded comrade to safety. General Cone pledged that the Army was committed to “gender-neutral” physical fitness tests.Marine officials also said they might change the initial physical standards that recruits have to meet before they are sent off to boot camp."

And the coalition asked a freshman lawmaker, Senator James Sanders Jr. of Queens, to lead the Alcoholism and Drug Abuse Committee. Both are minor committees.But shortly before midnight, several hours after the coalition had announced his appointment, Mr. Sanders said the announcement was mistaken and he had not accepted the position.Mr. Sanders said one of the leaders of the coalition, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, a Bronx Democrat, “was kind enough to make a very generous offer to me, which I subsequently declined.” He declined to explain his reasoning.Mr. Sanders said Mr. Klein was “not to blame” for the mistaken announcement, adding, “I was not as clear as I needed to be.”Racial diversity of the Senate leadership has been an issue since last fall’s election, in which Democrats won 33 of the Senate’s 63 seats. Many of the Senate Democrats are black or Hispanic; all of the Senate Republicans are white.Six Democrats — all but one of them white — joined with the Republicans to form a coalition to lead the Senate, leaving most Democrats in the minority.Civil rights leaders immediately cried foul, saying the coalition would have the effect of denying leadership roles to nonwhite lawmakers. They urged the leaders of the coalition to look beyond their ranks for committee chairmen, prompting the decision on Thursday to offer committee chairmanships to Senators Adams and Sanders.The lone nonwhite member of the majority coalition, Senator Malcolm A. Smith, a Queens Democrat, will lead the Social Services Committee."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/us/politics/obama-and-senators-to-push-for-an-immigration-overhaul.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama and a bipartisan group of senators will begin separate but simultaneous efforts next week to build support for an overhaul of immigration laws, an effort that had long stalled in Washington but was pushed to the forefront again during the 2012 presidential campaign.The group of at least six senators with a long-held interest in immigration issues is preparing to release a detailed set of principles next Friday, laying the legislative foundation for what they hope will become a comprehensive immigration bill. Their initiative coincides with a similar push by the White House. On Friday, the president met with members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, calling the issue “a top legislative priority,” and on Tuesday he is set to give an immigration-focused speech in Nevada, where Hispanic voters are growing in numbers.The Senate proposal will probably include four main elements: border enforcement, employer enforcement, handling the future flow of legal immigration (including temporary agriculture workers and high-skilled engineers) and a pathway to citizenship for those who entered the nation illegally. Mr. Obama’s approach will largely echo his 2011 immigration “blueprint,” which he first outlined in a speech in El Paso, and calls for a pathway to citizenship for the more than 11 million illegal immigrants already in the country.Though all members of the Senate group agree that some pathway to legal residency must be a part of the final proposal, they are still divided on what exactly that route should be. Republican lawmakers are urging that border security be tied to a pathway to citizenship and other requirements like having those who entered illegally go to the back of the line behind immigrants already waiting to enter the country legally, paying fines and back-taxes, and learning English.“You’ve got border security, you’ve got employer verification and you’ve got a temporary worker program that addresses the magnet, so those three things have to go together to address operational control over your border,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, one of the senators mapping out the legislation. “Then you go to the next big thing — the 12 million. How do you deal with the 12 million in a firm, fair way, realizing you can’t put them all in jail and they’re not all going to self-deport?”The bipartisan group, which has been meeting regularly since the November election, includes Mr. Graham, the Democratic Senators Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Charles E. Schumer of New York, and the Republican Senators John McCain of Arizona and Marco Rubio of Florida. Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, and the Republican Senators Jeff Flake of Arizona and Mike Lee of Utah have also taken part in the discussions.“It’s going far better than any of us expected,” Mr. Schumer said in an interview. “On both sides, there is a spirit that everyone is going to have to meet somewhere in the middle, and we’re very close to coming out with a detailed list of principles.”Aides said that the group hoped to have legislation ready by the end of March and was aiming for a vote in the Senate before the August recess. Though Republicans talked about handling immigration reform in steps, the senators are aiming for a comprehensive bill.Mr. Rubio, who has been publicly promoting his own set of principles, was approached by the group in December, said a Republican close to the senator. However, it was unclear until recently whether he would join the bipartisan team or offer his own proposal.In 2010, Mr. Graham and Mr. Schumer outlined a framework for overhauling immigration in a Washington Post op-ed. Their proposal similarly called for four central elements and “a tough but fair path to legalization for those already here,” but it did not advance. It is now being used as a starting point for the group’s efforts.The 2012 election, in which Mr. Obama beat Mitt Romney with the help of 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, has also proved a galvanizing force for Republicans. “Because of the mood of the country that it’s time to move forward on this issue, it’s different than it was some years ago,” Mr. McCain said. “The election results always have an effect on that.”Both Democratic and Republican advocates for immigration changes are hoping that the White House will delay releasing any specific plan of its own to allow a bipartisan bill to emerge from the Senate. While Republicans have previously called upon Mr. Obama to take the lead, they say the timing, now that compromise in the Senate is under way, is inauspicious."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/asia/india-needs-to-reset-its-moral-compass-president-says.html,"NEW DELHI — President Pranab Mukherjee on Friday warned about the danger of corruption corroding Indian public life and called on the country to “reset its moral compass” in light of a grisly gang rape and murder of a young woman that have stirred outrage and protests in India and around the world.Mr. Mukherjee, speaking in a nationally televised address on the eve of Republic Day, the national holiday observing the enactment of India’s democratic constitution, made a blunt call for gender equity and described the Dec. 16 attack on the young woman in New Delhi as a “grave tragedy that has shattered complacency.”“The brutal rape and murder of a young woman, a woman who was a symbol of all that new India strives to be, has left our hearts empty and our minds in turmoil,” Mr. Mukherjee said. “We lost more than a valuable life; we lost a dream. If today young Indians feel outraged, can we blame our youth?”The position of president is largely ceremonial in India’s parliamentary democracy. But Mr. Mukherjee, who became president last year, is one of India’s most experienced and respected political figures. On Friday, he used what is often a bland and celebratory address to deliver a plaintive message to the nation.“When we brutalize a woman, we wound the soul of our civilization,” he said, noting the sanctity of a woman in India’s Hindu religious traditions. “It is time for the nation to reset its moral compass. Nothing should be allowed to spur cynicism, as cynicism is blind to morality. We must look deep into our conscience and find out where we have faltered.”Mr. Mukherjee’s remarks came as the rape and its aftermath continued to shake India. On Wednesday, a special government commission led by a former chief justice of the Indian Supreme Court released a report calling for major reforms in policing as well as legislation to expand criminal penalties for some crimes against women.Meanwhile, on Thursday, a judge presiding over a special “fast track” court in New Delhi began hearing the trial of five defendants in the rape case. The case could last for several months, with a huge list of witnesses, though the judge has invoked a gag order that has tightly restricted what information can be made public about the proceedings.The case has resonated, not only because of the grisly brutality of the attack, but also because of the clumsy and, in some cases, insensitive response of India’s political class. The police were initially called in to beat back protesters, many of them college students. Several politicians and spiritual leaders were quoted making insensitive comments about the case.More recently, political parties have sought to tap into the anger unleashed by the attack — often with unorthodox solutions. In Mumbai, the country’s financial capital, a right-wing Hindu nationalist party, the Shiv Sena, has distributed kitchen knives and chili powder to women, even as they described it as a symbolic gesture.In his address, Mr. Mukherjee spoke about how the rape case had tapped into the disillusionment of India’s younger generation, one that had already been expressing disenchantment with the country’s political system. This group, often described as India’s “demographic dividend,” is struggling to find quality jobs, quality education and opportunity in India’s economy.“The future belongs to them,” Mr. Mukherjee said. “They are today troubled by a range of existential doubts. Does the system offer due reward for merit? Has corruption overtaken morality in public life? Does our legislature reflect emerging India or does it need radical reforms? These doubts have to be set at rest. Elected representatives must win back the confidence of the people.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/europe/us-withdraws-from-project-with-russia-on-civil-society.html,"MOSCOW — The United States is withdrawing from a bilateral Russian-American working group on civil society, a three-year-old project that embodied the spirit of the “reset” between Washington and Moscow, in answer to Russia’s recent crackdown on civil society groups.The “civil society working group” was one of 20 groups convened in 2009 by Presidents Barack Obama and Dmitri A. Medvedev, as Washington made a concerted push to repair relations with the Kremlin and embark on a series of bilateral projects, including cooperation on Iran and Afghanistan, and the signing of a new nuclear treaty. However, relations between the two governments have come under increasing strain over the last year, as President Vladimir V. Putin returned to power accusing American officials of stirring up political dissent in Russia. Nonprofit groups have come under particular pressure, as lawmakers passed new laws severely restricting foreign financing, requiring them to register as “foreign agents,” and expanding the definition of high treason to include assisting foreign organizations.On Friday, Thomas Melia, the deputy assistant secretary of state for democracy, human rights and labor, said in a statement that the decision to withdraw from the civil society working group was made “in light of recent steps taken by the Russian government to impose restrictions on civil society.”Mr. Melia said the working group was a bilateral project “designed to foster the development of civil society,” and that new restrictions imposed in recent months “called into serious question whether maintaining that mechanism was either useful or appropriate,” according to a copy of the statement, provided by the American Embassy in Moscow.The working group had not met in a plenary session for more than a year, amid disputes between the two sides about its scope and format.The fraying of bilateralrelations escalated during political campaigns in both countries and accelerated with a recent legislative tit-for-tat. After Congress passed the Magnitsky Act, a provision punishing Russian officials who are accused of human rights violations, Russia banned all adoptions of Russian children by American families and  banned American financing of nonprofit organizations seen as politically active.Dmitri S. Peskov, Mr. Putin’s spokesman, said he regretted the American decision but played down its importance.“It means nothing, actually,” he said. “We deeply regret that that we’ve been deprived of one of the formats of dialogue, without compensating its absence with a new one. We are very sorry about that. It’s negative for both Moscow and Washington.”But he said it did not pose a great loss, especially because Russia insists its domestic affairs should not be subject to international scrutiny.“We cannot discuss our domestic affairs,” he said. “We can share our views, exchange our opinions, but we can never discuss our domestic affairs.” He added that the commission had not been meeting frequently. “We won’t have any phantom pains after losing something indispensable,” he said.The commission — like the reset policy itself — had come under much criticism from Russian activists, many of whom complained that Washington had lessened its pressure over human rights because it was pursuing strategic goals, like Russian cooperation in Iran and Afghanistan.“In practice, it has turned out that human rights and the rule of law and democracy have all but disappeared from the agenda in the U.S.-Russia dialogue,” said Yuri Dzhibladze, president of the Center for Development of Democracy and Human Rights, an advocacy group based in Moscow. The working group, he said, had become “a symbolic anatomy of the failure of the reset policy.”“This particular working group has not been too helpful, and I’m glad it is gone,” he said. “We should not pretend that this has been a real mechanism for dialogue.”"

Huntley, had waived her right to have a grand jury consider potential charges, an indication that she planned to plead guilty.She has not yet been formally charged in federal court.A spokesman for the office of Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District, would not provide details on the case, though one person with knowledge of the case said that Ms. Huntley would plead guilty to federal mail fraud charges.A lawyer for Ms. Huntley, Sally Butler, did not respond to requests for comment.Ms. Huntley, 74, who served as a state senator for six years and lost a re-election bid in the Democratic primary last year, also faces state charges in connection with the nonprofit group, Parent Workshop Inc.She was arrested on corruption charges in the summer after an investigation by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli.In that case, Ms. Huntley is expected to plead guilty to tampering with physical evidence, a felony, according to one of the people. Prosecutors said the nonprofit agency was a sham that misused taxpayer money.Money from Parent Workshop was supposed to help poor parents navigate the New York City school system.After her indictment on charges of tampering with physical evidence, falsifying business records and conspiracy to commit those crimes, Ms. Huntley was stripped of her leadership positions and committee rankings in the State Senate. She was the ranking Democrat on the Committee on Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities.The wrongdoing in the state case extended to her family and members of her office, according to the state indictment.Also charged in the case were Lynn H. Smith, a niece of Ms. Huntley; Patricia D. Savage, Ms. Huntley’s aide; and David R. Gantt, a former aide to Ms. Huntley. Ms. Smith and Ms. Savage were officers of Parent Workshop.Ms. Smith and Ms. Savage are accused of stealing $30,000 from the group and were charged with several counts of grand larceny.Mr. Gantt was accused of falsifying documents.They are scheduled for trial in February."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/nyregion/coke-executives-give-christine-quinns-campaign-9750.html,"The American soft-drink industry, fighting Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg’s restrictions on sugary drink sizes, is courting a lawmaker who could eventually have the influence to overturn the rules: Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker and a leading mayoral candidate.Executives from the Coca-Cola Company donated nearly $10,000 this month to Ms. Quinn’s campaign, public records show, days before industry lawyers argued against the mayor’s plan in State Supreme Court.The industry, fearful that New York City’s first-in-the-nation limits will erode profits and spawn copycat policies around the country, is hopeful that Mr. Bloomberg’s plan can be undone by legislative or executive action once City Hall changes hands at the end of this year.No other mayoral candidate appeared to benefit from the beverage industry’s largess, although several of Ms. Quinn’s rivals, including Comptroller John C. Liu and one of his predecessors, William C. Thompson Jr., have been outspoken in their criticism of the drink restrictions.The Coke executives’ campaign contributions represented a noticeable sum for Ms. Quinn, who has expressed unease with the soda limits, which would restrict sales of sugary drinks in containers larger than 16 ounces.She has suggested that the measure is punitive and will not necessarily be effective at limiting calorie intake, as Mr. Bloomberg has argued. Still, Ms. Quinn, an ally of his, declined to take up legislation to overturn the restrictions, which were approved by the Board of Health last fall and are set to take effect in March.A spokesman for Ms. Quinn’s campaign declined to comment on Friday on the contribution.The soft-drink industry, which has given millions of dollars to politicians as it fights taxes and restrictions on its products, has aggressively courted New York lawmakers since Mr. Bloomberg unveiled his proposal last spring.This month, the political arm of Coca-Cola contributed $1,000 to the campaign of Councilwoman Letitia James, a candidate for city public advocate who emerged as a leading opponent of the mayor’s plan, records show. In November, Melissa Mark-Viverito, another councilwoman who criticized the mayor’s plan, received $75 from a marketing official at PepsiCo.The contributions to Ms. Quinn, which totaled $9,750 and ranged from $500 to $1,500 apiece, came from 16 high-ranking Coca-Cola employees, some based at the company’s Atlanta headquarters, including Clyde C. Tuggle, the senior chief public affairs and communications officer, and Sonya Soutus, a senior vice president for public affairs.“We support candidates that promote fair policies that enrich the communities and marketplaces where Coca-Cola employees live and work,” Gary McElyea, a spokesman for Coca-Cola, said by e-mail.Officials at Pepsi also contributed $175 each to the campaigns of Daniel R. Garodnick, a councilman, and Reshma Saujani, who is running for public advocate, in the last four months. A manager for Coca-Cola in the Bronx gave $175 to the Council campaign of Robert H. Waterman, a Brooklyn pastor."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/asia/north-korea-turns-its-ire-on-south-korea.html,"SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea turned its anger on South Korea on Friday, warning the South Koreans they could suffer “physical countermeasures” for any enforcement of the tightened international sanctions meant to stop its ballistic missile and nuclear weapons activities.The North Korean warning came a day after it bluntly threatened the United States, saying North Korea had no interest in talks on denuclearizing itself and would forge ahead with its missile and weapons development, with the goal of attaining the capability to hit American territory. North Korea framed the warning, including a threat to stage a third nuclear test, as a deterrent to what it called American hostility and efforts to isolate the country.While the tone of the message was not unexpected after the United Nations Security Council’s unanimous decision this week on North Korea sanctions, the threats represent a new challenge to President Obama as he begins his second term, and to the incoming conservative president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye. She had signaled she would be more open to the North than the current president, but since her election last month she has said she will not tolerate the North’s nuclear program and will deal sternly with what she has called North Korean provocations.In a statement issued in the name of North Korea’s Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, which manages relations with South Korea, the North gave no hint of what countermeasures were envisioned against the South over enforcement of the sanctions.While the North does not follow through on many of its threats, it does have a history of unexpected military attacks — most recently, its shelling of a border island in 2010 that left four South Koreans dead. It was also blamed for sinking a South Korean warship the same year, leaving 46 sailors dead, despite North Korean denials.Those two episodes were among the most serious in decades between the two Koreas, dispelling Washington’s desire to engage North Korea in serious negotiation. While calling for a vigorous enforcement of United Nations sanctions, Glyn Davies, Washington’s special envoy on North Korea, also appealed Thursday to the North’s new leader, Kim Jong-un, not to miss opportunities for a new beginning, stressing that Washington could not improve ties with the North without progress in inter-Korean relations.North Korea’s outburst against South Korea on Friday was the latest installment of a verbal barrage it started after the Security Council on Tuesday adopted a resolution condemning a Dec. 12 rocket launching by the North. The resolution called the launching a violation of earlier United Nations resolutions banning it from testing ballistic missile technology, and called for tightening sanctions against the country. Especially notable was that China, the longtime North Korean protector and advocate, voted for the resolution.Referring to the South Koreans, North Korea said: “If the puppet group of traitors takes a direct part in the U.N. ‘sanctions,’ the D.P.R.K. will take strong physical countermeasures against it,” using the acronym for its official name, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. “ ‘Sanctions’ mean a war and a declaration of war against us.”The United Nations resolution was the fifth against the North for its rocket and nuclear programs since 1993. It calls for tightening existing sanctions, including expanding a travel ban on North Korean officials and broadening the means for United Nations member nations to intercept and confiscate cargo headed for the North.Ms. Park’s office said Friday that the president-elect would soon send a high-level delegation to Washington for a policy consultation at which North Korea was expected to be a focus of discussion.The United Nations sanctions and the North’s angry reactions dissipated early hopes that changes of leadership in the North, the South and in the Obama administration would open the way for easing tensions. North Korea, which has lived through American-led trade embargoes, considers itself a small yet proud nation struggling to maintain its independence in the face of an “imperialist” plot to erase it from the earth. It has typically called any new round of American-inspired sanctions a declaration of war.For the United States, a new entanglement over North Korea could distract from the American focus on pressuring Iran over its disputed nuclear program, which the Iranians say is peaceful but which the West suspects is meant to develop nuclear weapons capability. Talks aimed at resolving that dispute are stalled.Some strategic weapons policy analysts suggested that North Korea’s defiant tone, and the relatively muted American response, had set an example for Iran by demonstrating what can be achieved when an American adversary is armed with nuclear weapons. Iranian leaders, like North Korea’s Kim family, view America as a nuclear-armed bully that respects only the threat of force.Jeffrey Lewis, a nonproliferation expert at the Monterey Institute of International Studies in Monterey, Calif., said he feared that North Korea was now intent on demonstrating the ability to produce a far more powerful nuclear weapon than the two relatively small nuclear devices it had tested so far.“If you think international politics is basically about power and that power is basically about armaments, then having a small number of fission devices is not good enough,” he said. “You want big nuclear devices.” (American intelligence officials believe North Korea has enough plutonium for roughly 6 to 10 weapons.)Others dismissed the idea that Iran is taking any political cues from North Korea. They noted that Iran remained a signatory to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty and that Iranian leaders had repeatedly asserted that they had no interest in nuclear weapons.“They see North Korea is starving and isolated with no resources whatsoever,” said Gary G. Sick, an American academic and Iran expert who served on the National Security Council under the Ford, Carter and Reagan administrations. He called the connectivity on the nuclear issue between Iran and North Korea “a Western argument — I’ve never seen anybody in Iran make that argument.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/europe/alexis-tsipras-greece-opposition-leader-calls-for-debt-renegotiation.html,"The 38-year-old leftist opposition leader in Greece who could become its next prime minister on a wave of simmering popular fury over the government’s austerity measures, called on Friday for a European summit meeting to ease the crushing debts that threaten not only his country but all of Europe.The opposition leader, Alexis Tsipras, whose criticism of international bailouts propelled his party, Syriza, to win the second biggest bloc of parliamentary seats in the June 2012 elections, also said he did not believe Greece would be forced to withdraw from the group of 17 countries that use the euro currency. Greece’s heavy indebtedness has raised fears that the country could leave or be expelled from the euro zone, a possibility that many economists regard as a threat to the euro’s survival.“They say I am the most dangerous man in Europe,” Mr. Tsipras said in an interview with the editorial board of The New York Times. “What I feel is dangerous is the policy of austerity in Europe. The Greek people have paid a heavy price.”Mr. Tsipras was in New York as part of a trip to the United States that has included meetings in Washington with the International Monetary Fund and the Treasury Department. The trip is part of a campaign intended to bolster his credibility as a politician and to counter what his aides call the fictional portrayals of him as a financial bomb-thrower in Greece’s mainstream news media, controlled by the so-called oligarch families of privilege in the country who fear Syriza’s ascent to power.Given the fragility of the conservative-led coalition that took over after the June elections, any no-confidence vote in Parliament could lead to new elections that give Mr. Tsipras the latitude to form a government. Recent polls put Syriza’s popularity at nearly 30 percent, about the same as the current coalition leader, the conservative New Democracy party.This month Mr. Tsipras also visited Germany, Europe’s most powerful economy, which has been the driving force behind the insistence that Greece must endure sacrifices and impose fiscal discipline in exchange for help on its debt burden. Mr. Tsipras has argued that the strategy has not only been an expensive failure but has also increased Greece’s indebtedness relative to the size of its economy, where joblessness and cuts in wages and benefits have stoked widespread anger.After six years of recession in Greece, he said, “we are witnessing a humanitarian crisis.”The symptoms were on display this week in Athens, where striking subway workers, outraged over pay cuts, paralyzed a transit system that carries one million riders a day. The government on Friday used an emergency decree to halt the strike.Mr. Tsipras said he would like to see a summit meeting that would result in an end to the austerity approach, which he said is needed to restart growth and avert a deeper economic malaise.“We are suggesting an overall plan for a European solution,” he said. “A European conference on debt that would include all of the countries of the region facing a significant debt issue.”He drew an analogy to the London Debt Agreement of 1953, in which postwar Germany’s debt was cut by 50 percent and the repayment spread over 30 years.Mr. Tsipras said the German government, led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, has held the possibility of expulsion from the euro zone over Greece as leverage for enforcing its austerity solution, but that in his view neither Germany nor its supporters want to see Greece exit the euro.“The constant threats, that they will kick us out of the euro zone, is a strategy with no foundation,” he said. “It’s just a way to blackmail us.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/us/politics/as-republicans-debate-future-direction-one-senator-steps-aside.html,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. — The next round of Republican primary fights is not far away, which prompted Gov. Bobby Jindal of Louisiana to offer a blunt warning this week: “We’ve got to stop being the stupid party.”With bruising defeats from the last two election cycles still fresh in his mind, particularly the races that helped cost Republicans control of the Senate, Mr. Jindal’s stern message to his party highlighted the divisions among Republicans as they try to restore their brand and rebuild.The critiques many Republicans have about their party are rooted in the divisive primary campaigns that have knocked out veteran lawmakers, only to produce flawed candidates who have uttered highly charged statements that have alienated many voters.The challenge was highlighted anew on Friday as Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, announced his intention to step down next year. In doing so, he avoids a contentious ideological battle that has toppled several fellow Republicans seen in Washington as steady and valuable members of the party’s mainstream.The difficulties facing the Republican Party are framed by Mr. Jindal’s urgent plea, which he delivered here Thursday evening to a meeting of the Republican National Committee, and the retirement of Mr. Chambliss. Mr. Chambliss had faced bracing criticism — and a possible primary challenge on his right flank — for his work with Democrats to find a bipartisan deficit reduction plan that would have included added tax revenues as well as spending cuts.Party elders also argue that the recurring fiscal brinkmanship in Washington has been wrongheaded for Republicans, who often seem to be willing to risk the nation’s economy simply to get their way. At the same time, some Republicans expressed dismay at the inability of conservative House members to see the end-of-year tax deal as a victory since it made permanent nearly all the Bush-era tax cuts, though it raises taxes on the most affluent.Republicans also came under criticism this week for what some saw as clumsy and ill-informed questioning of Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton during hearings  on the attack on the diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. Senator Ron Johnson, Republican of Wisconsin, initially questioned whether Mrs. Clinton’s emotional response at the Senate hearing to the four American deaths  was manufactured to duck questions.  He later said he should not have speculated, but some conservatives applauded the aggressive line. The competing schools of thought illustrate the conflicting currents pulling the Republican Party in opposite directions: Even as Mr. Jindal and an array of leaders are encouraging the party to temper its tone and appeal to a broader set of voters, its core conservative voters continue to punish Republicans who do just that. For his deficit negotiations with seven other senators, Republican and Democrat, Mr. Chambliss had raised the ire of Tea Party groups and other conservatives, who actively promoted primary challenges.Reince Priebus, who was re-elected on Friday to a second term as chairman of the Republican National Committee, said it was imperative for the party to expand its appeal to a wider cross-section of voters. He said the party did not need to dilute its principles, but should raise its tolerance.“There is one clear, overriding lesson from November: We didn’t have enough votes,” Mr. Priebus said. “We have to find more supporters. We have to go places we haven’t been and invite new people to join us.”The message is complicated by the divisions inside the Republican Party. Those were underscored in Georgia, where Mr. Chambliss faced potential challenges from Representative Tom Price, a leading conservative voice in the House, or Karen Handel, a former Georgia secretary of state who lost her run for the governorship, despite the backing of Sarah Palin.In his retirement announcement, Mr. Chambliss expressed confidence that he would have beaten such foes, even as he voiced his frustration that compromise was increasingly impossible in Washington.“I have no doubt that had I decided to be a candidate, I would have won re-election,” he said. “Instead, this is about frustration, both at a lack of leadership from the White House and at the dearth of meaningful action from Congress.”Party leaders debated the future of the Republican Party with an air of humility after losing the White House and seats in the House and the Senate. In interviews here over the last three days, the state officials said they intended to try to bring more discipline to the primary campaigns in 2014 to avoid ending up with a nominee who has little hope of winning a general election.They widely applauded Mr. Jindal’s terse admonition to the party.“He’s right,” said Lenny Curry, chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. “We have allowed the message to get out that the Republican Party is the party of no and doesn’t care about diverse groups of people. It’s just nonsense.”But the conservative groups that have fueled such primary challenges have shown little willingness to back down. The Tea Party movement is watching the fiscal debate carefully and already placing Republicans on notice.Jenny Beth Martin, the national coordinator and co-founder of the Tea Party Patriots, who is based in Georgia, said she was Mr. Chambliss’s 2008 re-election chairwoman in Cherokee County, an outer suburb of Atlanta.After his vote for the Wall Street bailout that year, she said she could not get Republican activists to take her yard signs. Her own husband refused to vote for him. With Mr. Chambliss’s work on the deficit, conservative activists turned on him en masse, she said.“Georgia’s a solid Republican state where the people elected as Republicans should be sticking with the principles of fiscal responsibility,” she said. “When you increase the debt limit, when you raise taxes and haven’t cut even a single penny, that’s not responsible.”Ms. Martin, whose group has actively sought primary challengers for Republican veterans, bristled at Mr. Jindal’s criticism of candidates like Richard E. Mourdock of Indiana and Todd Akin of Missouri.But others in the party latched on to Mr. Jindal’s entreaties.Tom Davis, a former congressman who once headed the Republican’s House campaign arm, said the problem went beyond the party’s failure to win over minority voters. Educated and affluent suburban voters who were once the Republican Party’s backbone have drifted to the Democrats, he said. In their absence, the party is attracting a more populist, less educated core.“Everybody says it’s changing demographics. It’s not just that,” Mr. Davis said. “A lot of former Republicans are voting Democratic.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/us/politics/gay-lawmakers-growing-presence-suggests-shift-in-attitudes.html,"WASHINGTON — When Mark Takano ran unsuccessfully for Congress twice in the early 1990s, his opponents tried to smear him as a “homosexual liberal” and a “nutzoid.” One of them even had pink fliers printed that asked, “A Congressman for Riverside ... Or San Francisco?”When he ran again last year, he won by almost 20 points. “Flash forward 18 years,” Mr. Takano said recently, “and the very macho building tradesmen are behind me. I’m getting pictures with them in their hard hats.”For decades, the words “gay” and “Congress” were usually seen together only in stories of scandal and shame: an arrest after an illicit proposition in an airport bathroom, accusations of trawling for sex on a phone service. When Gerry E. Studds came out 30 years ago, the first congressman to do so, it was only after an affair with a 17-year-old Congressional page was revealed.But in the 113th Congress there are six openly gay or bisexual members in the House — a small but tangible sign that their presence at the highest levels of government is no longer something only whispered about. The Senate has its first lesbian, Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin. The lawmakers’ partners, no longer relegated to the shadows or introduced generically as “friends,” stood beside them on the House floor when they were sworn in this month. Their adopted children are attending Congressional retreats.And this week they sat in President Obama’s presence as he insisted on equality for “our gay brothers and sisters,” words few of them ever expected to hear in a president’s Inaugural Address.Congress has never been an accurate reflection of the country it serves. It remains far whiter, wealthier and more male than the nation’s population. But as their numbers in Congress gradually increase, there is a sense among these newcomers that they are forcing some of their colleagues to rethink gay rights and homosexuality. The presence of openly gay men and women and their families was a factor that many believe was decisive in turning the tide for states where same-sex marriage was legalized by legislatures. Seeing them helped put a human face on a concept that many legislators had thought about only in the abstract.Yet even with the opportunities gay men, lesbians and bisexuals say their membership in Congress presents, their reception has not been a completely warm one. One of the first acts of the Republican-controlled House was to set aside funds to defend the 1996 law that prohibits the recognition of same-sex marriages because the Obama administration has stopped supporting it. And not everyone seems completely comfortable with their presence, like members of a Christian prayer group who seemed taken aback at a recent Congressional retreat when one noted he was married to a man. But in some ways the most telling sign of the gay lawmakers’ advancement in Congress is the fact that their presence is now a little more routine.“It’s becoming — ever so slowly — more than a novelty to be a gay member of Congress,” said Representative David Cicilline of Rhode Island. Like all the openly gay, lesbian and bisexual members, Mr. Cicilline is a Democrat.Representative Jared Polis of Colorado observed that it was not too long ago “when it was just Barney and Tammy.” He was referring to Ms. Baldwin, a member of the House before she was elected to the Senate, and Barney Frank of Massachusetts, who retired but was the first member of Congress to speak openly about his homosexuality.“But with six of us” in the House, “it’s harder to keep track. And it’s always going to be assumed that there are gays and lesbians in the room,” added Mr. Polis, who has a young son with his partner and is the most senior gay member of the House. Together the six of them will lead a caucus that will champion gay rights and other equal protection issues. The other members will include Mr. Cicilline; Mr. Takano of California; Sean Patrick Maloney of New York; Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who is bisexual; and Mark Pocan of Wisconsin.Mr. Pocan was elected to fill Ms. Baldwin’s House seat. In the last Congress, there were four openly gay or lesbian House members and none in the Senate.The retirement of Mr. Frank, long the dominant voice on gay rights in Congress, also opens the door to some of the newer, fresher faces to take more visible and influential roles. “Barney Frank, who we all know and love, is one of those larger-than-life personalities,” Mr. Polis said. “But certainly the way I’d approach this is in a much more collaborative manner.”Seven out of 535 is still relatively small. It equals just over 1 percent of the seats in the House and Senate.“Seven isn’t great,” conceded Denis Dison, a senior strategist with the Victory Fund, which works to elect openly gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgendered people to public office.Mr. Dison said he had recently added up the numbers of people who have served in Congress since the country’s birth. It added up to nearly 12,000, he said, and he can still count on both hands the number of those who were openly gay. “But there was an amazing leap forward in 2012 relative to history,” Mr. Dison added. “And in 2014 if two or three or four more out candidates are elected, this is not going to seem as big an accomplishment.”The makeup of the Republican-controlled House shows just how much of a climb gay rights supporters face. The Human Rights Campaign said that it counts only 184 of 435 members as solid supporters on the issue. By contrast, it counts 220 — a majority — as opponents of gay rights.In the Senate, the group says it considers 42 members opposed to gay rights and 42 in favor.And the new gay members say there have been awkward moments. Mr. Pocan said that when he was at a recent retreat for new members, representatives from a Christian organization stopped in to ask him if he would be interested in attending one of their prayer groups. One of them asked him if his wife had accompanied him to the retreat. He is married and wears a ring.“I said, ‘No, but my husband did,’ ” he recalled. An awkward pause followed. “Then she said, ‘Well, we have more offices to go to now.’ ”For some of the gay members, their freshman orientation sessions were a reminder of just how unequally the law treats them, since the entity that cuts their paychecks and provides benefits — the United States government — is barred from recognizing their relationships.“They would be explaining what your benefits were, then all of a sudden this embarrassed look would flash across their face like, ‘Oh, sorry. I guess this doesn’t apply to you,’ ” Mr. Maloney said.At a ceremonial swearing-in this month by John A. Boehner, the Republican speaker of the House, standing alongside Mr. Maloney were his partner of 20 years and their three adopted children."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/world/africa/us-weighing-how-much-help-to-give-frances-military-operation-in-mali.html,"WASHINGTON — The Obama administration is debating how much more aid it can give the French military forces who are battling Islamic militants in Mali, weighing the benefit of striking a major blow to Qaeda-linked fighters in Africa against concern about being drawn into a lengthy conflict there.The immediate issue is whether and how to supply American aerial refueling planes that would allow French jets to provide close-air support to ground forces moving north into territory held by the extremists. French and American officials have been in discussions for days, according to American and European officials, and administration officials say they expect a decision soon.All indications are that the administration is trying to find a solution, but that any refueling would probably be approved only with restrictions.“The discussions center on cost, and the concern about whether this becomes an open-ended mission for the French in Mali,” one Defense Department official said. “What does that mean about our commitment?”Most of the reservations about whether President Obama has the legal authority to engage in military operations were resolved, officials said, after it was determined that the main targets were linked to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb. But the degree to which President Obama wants to get involved in Mali is still an open question, presenting the president and his national security team with the latest in a series of decisions about how heavily to intervene in remote conflicts.Also in play is the depth of the American commitment to France, which is deploying nearly 3,000 ground troops to stop the expansion of a major terrorist sanctuary in Mali, its former colony.Mr. Obama’s aides say that the model under way in Mali now — with the French taking the lead, and a force from the region backing them up — is exactly what they want to encourage. But some officials say they believe the French went into Mali hastily, in the words of one official “before they understood exactly what they were biting off.”White House officials say they want to understand the broader political and strategic plan to end the conflict before they get more involved.But since France entered the conflict in early January, there has been little time for strategic planning. The United States has begun transporting a 600-member French mechanized battalion and its gear to Mali, and is providing intelligence information, including satellite imagery, American officials said on Friday. “The spigot is opened all the way,” one official said. So far that help has been provided at no cost to the French.But the refueling would bring the American involvement to a new level, directly supporting military attacks. And for Mr. Obama, who devoted part of his Inaugural Address on Monday to a celebration of the end of a war in Iraq and the winding down of the American commitment in Afghanistan, the prospect of getting involved in a conflict against a shadowy enemy far from the United States is unwelcome.The issue also comes as major national security posts are in transition. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has one more week in office, and the Senate is considering the nomination of her successor, Senator John Kerry, along with Chuck Hagel, Mr. Obama’s choice as the next defense secretary. Both have been outspoken in the past about not intervening in conflicts that American partners can handle, or where American interests are somewhat remote. In the case of Mali, one official said, American intelligence assessments have concluded that the Islamic extremists have little ability to threaten the United States. “But they can threaten the region,” he said, “and that’s where the argument for American involvement comes in.”The government of President François Hollande has said it will stay in Mali and the surrounding region as long as needed. The United States has been more hesitant about supporting the new government in Mali, which came to power in a coup mounted by an American-trained military leader.Mr. Obama talked on the phone on Friday with Mr. Hollande, but White House officials did not say whether the leaders had dwelled on the refueling issue. A White House statement said they had talked about the need to quickly establish an African-led force in Mali, as well as the importance of Mali’s establishing a path to elections and to “restoration of democratic governance” in the country.In support of its military operation in Mali, France is now flying a dozen Mirage and Rafale combat and reconnaissance aircraft from an air base in Chad.Several French tankers are providing air-to-air refueling for those planes, but officials in Paris would like to have American tankers ready as a backup if the ground operation faces stiffer resistance than anticipated, or an unforeseen crisis requires France to send more aircraft, a French official said on Friday.“Our major commanders would feel much more comfortable if things are not going as planned or are more difficult, to very quickly have some support from the Americans,” said the French official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe bilateral discussions.American and French officials have offered differing objectives for the military operation in Mali. Jean-Yves Le Drian, the French defense minister, said recently that the goal of France’s military action was to reclaim control of the north from the Islamist militants.“The goal is the total reconquest of Mali,” Mr. Le Drian said. “We will not leave any pockets.”But Gen. Carter F. Ham, the head of the Pentagon’s Africa Command, voiced more limited objectives.“We would all like to see the elimination of Al Qaeda and others from northern Mali,” General Ham said on Thursday in a speech at Howard University here. “Realistically, probably the best you can get is containment and disruption so that Al Qaeda is no longer able to control territory.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/soccer/in-england-manchester-city-advances-to-fifth-round-of-fa-cup.html,"Luton became the first nonleague team in 24 years to beat a top-flight club in F.A. Cup as Norwich was knocked out in the fourth round Saturday.Norwich, which is 85 places above fifth-tier Luton in the English soccer pyramid, was beaten, 1-0, at home after Scott Rendell scored in the 80th minute.There has not been such an upset in the F.A. Cup since Sutton beat Coventry, 2-1, in the third round in 1989. And not since 1949 has a nonleague team managed to overcome a team from the top flight beyond the third round.Luton, an F.A. Cup semifinalist in 1994, won the League Cup in 1988 and was in the top flight until 1992 before dropping down the divisions and enduring financial turmoil.MK Dons of the third tier delivered another upset by beating Queens Park Rangers, who are in last place in the Premier League, 4-2.Arsenal avoided humiliation at Brighton by coming from behind to beat the second-tier club, 3-2.Manchester City relied on Pablo Zabaleta’s late goal as the 2011 Cup winner advanced with a 1-0 victory over Stoke.Zabaleta, a defender from Argentina, stabbed the ball into the net in the 85th minute after Edin Dzeko clipped the ball across from Sergio Agüero’s pass.“We won it two years ago and know how important the competition is — we want to win it again,” Zabaleta said. “It’s always great to score and three goals this season is not bad for a fullback.”There was a setback for City, however, with Vincent Kompany limping off with a calf injury in the first half. He is likely to miss the Premier League match against Queens Park Rangers on Tuesday.SCHALKE LOSES GROUND Schalke lost more ground to league-leading Bayern Munich in the Bundesliga race in Germany after being held to a 0-0 draw at Augsburg.Mainz took full advantage with a 3-0 win at last-place Greuther Fürth to move into fifth place, one point ahead of Schalke, whose Coach Jens Keller is coming under increasing pressure.Elsewhere, Borussia Mönchengladbach stretched its unbeaten run to nine games in all competitions with a 2-1 victory at home over its local rival Fortuna Düsseldorf.Hannover beat Wolfsburg, 2-1, in another local derby, despite playing most of the game with 10 men after Sebastien Pocognoli was ejected in his Bundesliga debut.Eintracht Frankfurt won at home, 2-1, against Hoffenheim, which slipped into the relegation zone.BALLOT FOR U.S. HALL OF FAME Forward Taylor Twellman and defender Tony Sanneh are among five first-time eligible players on the ballot for the United States Soccer Hall of Fame.Twellman, now a broadcaster for ESPN, scored 101 league goals for Major League Soccer’s New England Revolution from 2002 to 2009 and retired after a series of concussions. He had six goals in 30 international appearances. Sanneh made 43 appearances for the United States national team, and his cross led to Brian McBride’s goal in a 3-2 upset of Portugal at the 2002 World Cup.Also eligible for the first time on the ballot, announced Friday, are the current D.C. United coach Ben Olsen, a former midfielder who was M.L.S. Rookie of the Year; and midfielders Wade Barrett and Angela Hucles.Among the 22 players on the ballot, Mauricio Cienfuegos, Roy Lassiter and Tisha Venturini-Hoch are in their final year of eligibility.Voting runs through Feb. 22. Voters include coaches, executives and members of the news media, and a player needs to be on at least two-thirds of the ballots to gain election.A WIN FOR IVORY COAST Ivory Coast rolled over Tunisia, 3-0, in Rustenburg, South Africa, on Saturday to move closer to a place in the quarterfinals at the Africa Cup of Nations.Yaya Touré scored in the 87th minute after Gervinho had given the Ivorians the halftime lead. Didier Ya Konan added the third seconds after coming on as a substitute.The captain Didier Drogba was dropped from the starting lineup for the first time, although he came on for the final 25 minutes, and Kolo Touré was also left out by Coach Sabri Lamouchi as he attempted to kick-start the campaign for the Ivorians, who are favored to the tournament.The victory means Ivory Coast, the only undefeated team in the tournament, could be the first team to advance if Algeria and Togo play to a tie in a later game Saturday. (REUTERS)MOURINHO UNDER FIRE Real Madrid Coach Jose Mourinho again chose not to speak to the news media as he celebrated his 50th birthday on Saturday.Coverage of the Spanish champions was dominated last week by a report in the Marca sports daily that said the team captains Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos had threatened to leave along with several teammates unless Mourinho was dismissed.The club president, Florentino Pérez, said the newspaper was lying and trying to destabilize the club but Marca has stuck by its account, the latest in a string of reports suggesting that not all is well among Mourinho and some of his leading players.The combative Portuguese has drawn criticism this season with his team 15 points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona. Madrid hosts its archrival Wednesday in the first leg of their King’s Cup semifinals.Elimination in the Cup and then a possible defeat against Manchester United in their Champions League Round of 16 series would almost certainly end Madrid’s hopes of winning a trophy this season and increase the pressure on Pérez to replace Mourinho.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/how-texas-keeps-voters-in-the-shadows.html,"Ross Ramsey, executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.For all of the public love politicians give to transparency these days, the state keeps a lot of information out of sight, or in places where it is really inconvenient to view.Their personal financial statements, for instance, don’t have a specific online residence, and because of filing deadlines are often way out of date. Lawmakers file the forms on paper. Anyone who wants to peek must visit the Texas Ethics Commission in Austin or send a request and wait by the mailbox. (The Texas Tribune has requested, paid for and posted those disclosures online, but the state still has not posted them.)It’s translucent, but not transparent.Money spent during the last week of a campaign doesn’t have to be disclosed until after the election. The last report is due eight days before Election Day, and the next one isn’t due for weeks. Campaigns have to report donations during that last week, but not spending. That means when voters cast ballots, they aren’t aware of Hail Mary advertising buys and late get-out-the-vote efforts.It’s one of those “man on the moon” questions, as in: Why is it they can put a man on the moon, but can’t file instant — or daily — reports on campaign spending?It’s opaque, unless you count historical access as transparency. Information that isn’t available to the decision-makers before they go to the polls hardly improves their decisions.Lawyers, for perfectly good reasons, don’t have to disclose their clients’ names; those clients, after all, have a right to hire their lawyers without telling everybody else they’ve done so. But on the public official side, that creates a loophole big enough for a fire engine: a legislator-lawyer doesn’t have to tell the rest of us when a bit of official business might benefit one of his or her unnamed clients.Consultants don’t have the attorney-client privilege that lawyers do, but lawmakers can — and do — list consultant as their occupation without telling us whom they’re being paid to advise.That describes the swap for a citizen Legislature. If legislators are supposed to have real jobs, they’ll run into conflicts. But they can run into conflicts even when they don’t have real jobs — or did you forget about the full-time Congress?Disclosure is supposed to be the remedy. It would be one thing for a legislator to vote in his or her own interests in the dark, and another to do so where voters, future opponents, reporters and other lawmakers can see what he or she has done. At some point in every session, a senator or state representative will jump up and vote for something like that — whether it’s Representative Gary W. Elkins, Republican of Jersey Village, debating a payday lending bill in 2011 while pointing to his ownership of a payday lending operation as proof of his expertise — or every civil lawyer in the Legislature voting on tort reform bills that change the laws they work with in their real jobs.Formal recusals don’t happen often. Representative Donna Howard, Democrat of Austin, recused herself in 2011 when the House was deciding whether she or her opponent had won a close election in 2010. Speaker Joe Straus, Republican of San Antonio, entered a statement in the House Journal in 2009 saying he would recuse on “matters related to the expansion of gambling at parimutuel racetracks in Texas” — a business his family was involved in. As a representative in 2003, Gene Seaman, Republican of Corpus Christi, recused himself from voting on a regional tax that had a direct impact on several of his properties.Sometimes, members “vote a white light” — which means they’re present but not voting yes or no — without saying why. Votes like that and votes that raise eyebrows are a lot more common than formal abstentions.This is allowed: voting on a bill that affects everyone in your industry — doctors on health care, lawyers on law, farmers on agriculture, etc. This is not allowed: voting on a bill that benefits a lawmaker’s own business in particular.It’s a fine distinction, but an important one, separating personal interests from broader industry or community interests. And it doesn’t work if there’s no disclosure to the rest of us — if the decision-makers are separated from information that would be useful in their decisions.That connection, or the lack of it, is why transparency is so popular."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/politics/obama-says-gun-control-advocates-should-listen-to-owners.html,"WASHINGTON – President Obama said that he and his guests go skeet shooting at Camp David “all the time” and that gun control advocates need “to do a little more listening” to understand why so many Americans are wary of government limits on firearms.In an interview released Sunday morning, Mr. Obama acknowledged that getting his package of gun proposals through Congress could be tough, and he expressed empathy for the strong sentiments of gun owners. Like Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who has mentioned that he owns two shotguns, Mr. Obama tried to associate himself with those who enjoy firing guns.“Up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time,” he told The New Republic in the interview, conducted Jan. 16, just after he unveiled his gun proposals.Asked about his family, he said, “Not the girls, but oftentimes guests of mine go up there. And I have a profound respect for the traditions of hunting that trace back in this country for generations. And I think those who dismiss that out of hand make a big mistake.”He added that the experience with guns in rural America differed dramatically from that in urban America. “If you grew up and your dad gave you a hunting rifle when you were 10, and you went out and spent the day with him and your uncles, and that became part of your family’s traditions, you can see why you’d be pretty protective of that,” he said.“So it’s trying to bridge those gaps that I think is going to be part of the biggest task over the next several months,” he added. “And that means that advocates of gun control have to do a little more listening than they do sometimes.”Mr. Obama has proposed reinstating and strengthening an expired ban on new assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, expanding criminal background checks for nearly all gun sales except those within families, and cracking down on straw purchasers who buy firearms for others who would not be able to pass a background check. He also used his executive authority to try to improve the background check database and to revive government research into gun violence.In the interview, Mr. Obama also expressed concern for the state of football in America, particularly at the college level, where there is no union to represent the interests of players.“I’m a big football fan,” he said, “but I have to tell you, if I had a son, I’d have to think long and hard before I let him play football. And I think those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to reduce some of the violence.”Asked about the continuing rebellion in Syria that has led to tens of thousands of deaths, Mr. Obama made clear that he has declined to intervene because he is haunted by a series of questions that he cannot answer satisfactorily.“In a situation like Syria,” he said, “I have to ask, can we make a difference in that situation? Would a military intervention have an impact? How would it affect our ability to support troops who are still in Afghanistan? What would be the aftermath of our involvement on the ground? Could it trigger even worse violence or the use of chemical weapons? What offers the best prospect of a stable post-Assad regime? And how do I weigh tens of thousands who’ve been killed in Syria versus the tens of thousands who are currently being killed in the Congo?”The interview was conducted by Chris Hughes, a founder of Facebook who bought The New Republic last year, and Franklin Foer, the magazine’s editor. Mr. Hughes was coordinator of online organizing for Mr. Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and has contributed money to him since then. The president gave the interview as the magazine is reintroducing itself in the coming days."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/politics/secret-donors-finance-fight-against-hagel.html,"A brand new conservative group calling itself Americans for a Strong Defense and financed by anonymous donors is running advertisements urging Democratic senators in five states to vote against Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s nominee to be secretary of defense, saying he would make the United States “a weaker country.”Another freshly minted and anonymously backed organization, Use Your Mandate, which presents itself as a liberal gay rights group but purchases its television time through a prominent Republican firm, is attacking Mr. Hagel as “anti-Gay,” “anti-woman” and “anti-Israel” in ads and mailers.Those groups are joining at least five others that are organizing to stop Mr. Hagel’s confirmation, a goal even they acknowledge appears to be increasingly challenging. But the effort comes with a built-in consolation prize should it fail: depleting some of Mr. Obama’s political capital as he embarks on a new term with fresh momentum.The media campaign to scuttle Mr. Hagel’s appointment, unmatched in the annals of modern presidential cabinet appointments, reflects the continuing effects of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which loosened campaign finance restrictions and was a major reason for the record spending by outside groups in the 2012 election. All told, these independent and largely secretly financed groups spent well over $500 million in an attempt to defeat Mr. Obama and the Democrats, a failure that seemed all the greater given the huge amounts spent.While the campaign against Mr. Hagel, a Republican, is not expected to cost more than a few million dollars, it suggests that the operatives running the independent groups and the donors that finance them — many of whom are millionaires and billionaires with ideological drive and business agendas that did not go away after the election — are ready to fight again.“We were anxious to get back into the battle,” said Nick Ryan, a Republican strategist and the founder of the American Future Fund, which started as a small, Iowa-based political committee in 2007 and has grown larger since taking a leading role now against Mr. Hagel. “Postelection we have new battle lines being drawn with the president; he kicks it off with these nominations and it made sense for us.”Groups like his would have been able to operate freely against Mr. Hagel even before Citizens United. But the ruling has served to erase what had been traditional fears among donors that their involvement in the fight of the day would lead to legal trouble or, for those who prefer to stay anonymous, unwanted public exposure. That confidence, in turn, has helped spur the increase in the number of political organizations that pop up to engage in the big political entanglement of the moment.American Future Fund was formed under a section of the tax code that allows it to keep its donors secret. It spent more than $20 million seeking to defeat Mr. Obama and the Democrats last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. Other major conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity — partly financed by the industrialist Koch family — and Crossroads GPS are not involved in the Hagel nomination, but have made it clear that they will continue to combat the president’s agenda on several fronts.The outside activity is not confined to Republicans. Mr. Obama’s campaign apparatus has transformed itself into a nonprofit political group, though it said it would disclose the names of its donors (and it is not getting involved in the Hagel fight).After Mr. Obama won re-election in November and Democrats kept their majority in the Senate and made inroads in the House, Republican Party officials and senior strategists with conservative outside groups predicted that some of the big financiers of the larger outside efforts would pull back and reassess their involvement and whether their millions were wasted. But while the donors have said they will insist that the groups they finance find lessons in last year’s losses, their interest and stakes in what happens in Washington have certainly not waned.For instance, the biggest individual financier of the so-called super PACs that sought to defeat Mr. Obama, Sheldon Adelson, is so invested in the fight over Mr. Hagel that he has reached out directly to Republican Senators to urge them to hold the line against his confirmation, which would be almost impossible to stop against six Republican “yes” votes and a unified Democratic caucus.Given the more than $100 million he donated to the anti-Obama effort last year, no lawmakers need to be reminded of his importance to their future endeavors. People briefed on his involvement said Mr. Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation and a longtime supporter of Israel, was calling in conjunction with the Republican Jewish Coalition, a group he has financed for several years.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in December, Mr. Adelson said he was prepared to “double” his investment in politics in the coming year.But it is unclear whether he is directly financing any of the anti-Hagel advertising. An associate of his, speaking about Mr. Adelson’s thinking on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe that expensive television campaigns are the answer to every political push given that Mr. Obama’s re-election team accomplished so much of its success through online and volunteer efforts.Citing similar reasons, another major Republican donor, Foster Friess, said in an interview that he had developed his own skepticism over “the whole idea of these multimedia ads from 45,000 feet.” After last year’s losses he said he was devoting most of his resources to an effort he called “Left-Right, Left-Right Forward March,” which finds projects liberals and conservatives can support together, like water purification in developing countries.Still, he said, “no one in this effort is going to give up the values that they think are important.” For him, that extends to Mr. Hagel, whose “past statements about Israel should be really taken into consideration” Mr. Friess said, adding, “and I would hope they could find a better person to serve in that position.”Whatever its chances of success, the blitz against Mr. Hagel is of a sort that has generally been reserved for elections and some Supreme Court nominations. The last major cabinet skirmish, over President George W. Bush’s nomination of John R. Bolton as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, had no comparable outside media blitz. Though goaded along by a phone campaign organized by the political action arm of the liberal group MoveOn, Democrats succeeded in blocking him in the Senate, forcing Mr. Bush to appoint him during a congressional recess.That was before the Citizens United decision.“This is the first big cabinet fight since Bolton,” said Michael Goldfarb, a strategist for a conservative group opposed to Mr. Hagel called the Emergency Committee for Israel and a founder of a conservative Web site called The Washington Free Beacon, which is running a steady stream of anti-Hagel news articles. “And things have evolved in the last seven years.”The most mysterious of the new groups is Use Your Mandate. Portraying itself as a gay rights group, it has sent mailers to voters in seven states — including New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Montana — and run television ads against Mr. Hagel in New York and Washington. It has sent out posts on Twitter questioning his gay rights record and asking, “Is this what we worked so hard for?” Established gay rights activists have expressed skepticism about the group’s authenticity.It has no Web site and it only lists as its address a post office box in New York. But paperwork filed with the Federal Communications Commission link it back to Tusk Strategies, a bipartisan political group founded by Bradley Tusk, a former strategist for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York.In an interview, Mr. Tusk would only identify its financiers as Democratic “gay and L.G.B.T. people who have been active in campaigns around the country.”Yet federal records show that Use Your Mandate uses Del Cielo Media, an arm of one of the most prominent Republican ad-buying firms in the country, Smart Media, with clients that have included the presidential campaigns of former Gov. Jon M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/world/americas/mexico-statue-of-ex-leader-of-azerbaijan-removed.html,"The Mexico City government removed a large statue of a former president of Azerbaijan from a central boulevard early Saturday, giving in after months of complaints by critics who said that Mexico’s capital was no place for the likeness of a man accused of suppressing democracy and committing human rights abuses. City workers, accompanied by police officers, arrived shortly after midnight at the little park that Azerbaijan’s embassy had paid to renovate. They pried up the statue of Heydar Aliyev, who ruled Azerbaijan from 1993 until just before his death in 2003, and then loaded it onto a trailer and carted it off to a city warehouse. Talks are continuing with Azeri officials to find a new home for the statue. As to whether the embassy wants its money back for the park renovations, the city government’s legal director, José Ramón Amieva, told the local news media on Saturday that the city had not yet received a request for reimbursement."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/politics/david-plouffe-senior-adviser-leaves-white-house.html,"WASHINGTON — Most White House jobs are self-explanatory: Chief of staff. Press secretary. National security adviser. Then there is the job of “senior adviser” — as influential as any, and more than most, but the sort of post whose duties change with each new occupant and his times.And so it is now that President Obama has tapped as his new senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who follows in the hard-to-follow steps of the two Davids most closely associated with Mr. Obama’s rapid rise, election and re-election: first David Axelrod, who left the White House two years ago, and then David Plouffe, whose final day there was Friday.The transition last week draws attention to a West Wing office that at once has been crucial to Mr. Obama’s presidency yet was nearly eliminated once he was re-elected and Mr. Plouffe (pronounced Pluff) kept to his plans to leave the administration.For the president’s first two years, Mr. Axelrod, 57, who is extroverted and disorganized, was the protector of the Obama brand, overseeing the president’s shift from campaign platform to governing agenda on all issues — and doing so amid an economic crisis that forced unanticipated actions like an $800 billion stimulus package and an overhaul of financial industry regulations.For the past two years, the introverted and hyper-disciplined Mr. Plouffe, 45, served as what he called “the connective tissue” between the administration and the re-election campaign, making sure that the actions of one did not threaten the success of the other.In November, with the president re-elected and his second-term agenda defined, Mr. Obama and close advisers initially wondered whether he needed a successor to Mr. Plouffe. Mr. Obama decided that he did — someone who could continue to take the long view, while others managed the daily distractions of their particular portfolios, domestic or international.“The president does want someone who’s thinking down the road a little bit — it’s hard to describe,” Mr. Plouffe said in an interview. “The role is really to make sure you’re thinking about things strategically, you’re thinking about the next move or two or three, you’re providing some guidance on messaging.”Of Mr. Pfeiffer, who is 37 and has been Mr. Obama’s communications director, Mr. Plouffe said: “Ultimately Dan’s going to be someone who’s going to be looked at most authoritatively to describe how a certain strategy would unfold, what the downsides are, what the trap doors are. You can’t really look at it as a direct replacement. Even Axe and I, we didn’t do exactly the same thing.”The job of senior adviser — equal parts counselor, confidant, strategist and truth-teller — is not new to the Obama White House, yet it is a relatively modern invention.The presidential historian Michael Beschloss cites as an early model Louis Howe, who guided the polio-stricken Franklin D. Roosevelt back into politics and ultimately the presidency and was so close a White House counselor that he stayed in the Lincoln Bedroom. But Mr. Beschloss said the role of an in-house strategist took root with President Richard M. Nixon and his reliance on his longtime aides H. R. Haldeman and John D. Ehrlichman.More recent examples that he and others cite include George Stephanopoulos and Paul Begala, who were aides to President Bill Clinton, and President George W. Bush’s advisers Karen Hughes, Karl Rove and Dan Bartlett.The near institutionalization of the job reflects “the whole idea of the permanent campaign,” Mr. Beschloss said. “Presidents have come to recognize that they do not have to worry about politics and their message only in election years.”By definition, a common attribute of these advisers seems to be enjoying a relationship of trust and familiarity, even intimacy, formed with a president by shared experience on the bumpy road to the White House.“An important thing is to view decisions through the prism of ‘Is this true to who we are?’ ” Mr. Plouffe said. “And that’s kind of an instinctive thing, a judgment on ‘Is this consistent with what we campaigned on, and who he is?’ ”While Mr. Plouffe and Mr. Axelrod have worked longer for Mr. Obama, Mr. Pfeiffer is one of “the originals,” as aides refer to those who have been with the president since at least January 2007, when he began his race to the White House. Fewer remain for the second term — among them Denis McDonough, designated as the new chief of staff; Alyssa Mastromonaco, deputy chief of staff; and the presidential assistants Valerie Jarrett and Pete Rouse — which lent weight to the argument for keeping a senior adviser, someone with institutional memory, aides said.While the stylistic differences between Mr. Axelrod and Mr. Plouffe were evident, Mr. Pfeiffer is similar enough to Mr. Plouffe — reserved, competitive and obsessed with how Americans get information online — that White House colleagues joke, “You’re going from one guy from Delaware with lots of P’s and F’s in his name to another.”Mr. Obama, in a surprise public farewell to Mr. Plouffe on Friday, said that “were it not for him, we would not have been as effective a White House, and I probably wouldn’t be here.”In the interview, Mr. Plouffe said, “The first thing I’m going to do is go spend a lot of time with my family,” including taking his son, Everett, 8, and his daughter, Vivian, 4, to and from school. Then he will give speeches, consult with private sector clients “and leave time to help him” — the president — “from the outside, unofficially.”While Mr. Plouffe is likely to be courted by Democrats running for the presidential nomination in 2016, he said he was done with presidential campaigns: “I think that — and I presume David would say the same thing — you’ll never top this.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/style/a-biden-moment.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama had just finished taking the oath and the Marine band played “Hail to the Chief” and the cameras panned to children waving little flags. Inaugurations are momentous things.And then, after the benediction, I opened an e-mail from my friend Matt, who had extracted another unalienable truth from the proceedings:“Biden is a testament to the transforming power of successful hair plugs.”Well yes, he is, though the hair plugs are not a new Biden phenomenon. What’s telling here is that at a spectacle so potent and on a stage so crowded, the eye would be so naturally drawn to the goofball understudy. In that sense, Matt represents a cultural wave.“Transforming” is the key word. In a few short months, the motor-tongued, muscle-car-loving heartbeat-away hell raiser has been transformed from gaffe-prone amusement to someone whose star shines as brightly as his teeth. He is the subject of viral C-Span videos, sitcom infatuations and an “autobiography” of his Onion-inspired alter-ego, “Diamond” Joe Biden, “The President of Vice.” (In his spare time, Mr. Biden also helped avert the fiscal cliff, is spearheading the White House plan to reduce gun violence and might even run for president in 2016.)We might sit at the dawn of the second Obama term, with Hillary in waiting, Republicans in therapy and Congressional approvals in sub-cockroach and colonoscopy territory. But for whatever reason, the perfect flower of this peculiar moment grows from the earthy core of Joseph Robinette Biden Jr.He may not be the most popular politician in America. Mr. Biden’s approval rating stands at 49 percent in the latest New York Times/CBS poll; not bad, but still a shade lower than his boss’s (51 percent). Mrs. Clinton trounces him in early surveys of Democrats eyeing the prospective field for 2016. Yet Mr. Biden wins in a landslide in an unscientific snapshot of comic appreciation, cult appeal and of-the-moment awesomeness. The White House recently received a petition from citizens insisting that a new reality show be created featuring the vice president (2,482 signatures at this writing).Here is one theory on why. In 1968, Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey spoke of something he called “The Politics of Joy,” a slogan he adopted to accentuate his trademark zest and enthusiasm as he ran for president. In fact, the notion was dreadfully off-pitch given the war, assassinations and upheaval of the day, and Mr. Humphrey took some ridicule for it.Mr. Biden, however, represents an updated standard-bearer for the politics of joy, said Joel K. Goldstein, a law professor at Saint Louis University and an expert on the United States vice presidency. (Disclosure: I quote Mr. Goldstein whenever possible, just so I can type the words “expert on the United States vice presidency,” which never fails to amuse me.) While these are not exactly joyous times either — politicians are often reviled and voters are no picnic — Mr. Biden is the one major Washington figure who consistently evokes a sense of thrill in what he is doing.Through receiving lines, pro forma thank-you calls and random glad-handing, he conveys an aura that he would rather be doing nothing else. The video of Mr. Biden swearing in newly elected members and greeting their families in the Old Senate Chamber this month provided 86 minutes of viral eloquence on this.“Spread your legs — you’re going to be frisked,” Mr. Biden ordered the husband of the new North Dakota senator, Heidi Heitkamp, after he was instructed by a photographer to put his hands at his side. Ms. Heitkamp cracked up, and Mr. Biden then explained — helpfully! — that when someone says “drop your hands to your side” to “somebody in North Dakota, they think it’s a frisk.” Now better informed, the Heitkamps went on their way.Mr. Biden also told the brother of the Republican senator Tim Scott that he could “help with” his “pecs.” As everyone knows, Mr. Biden is a fitness god. And not in that trendy P90X Paul Ryan way. “There’s gym strong and there’s old man strong,” explained the “Saturday Night Live” Biden, played by Jason Sudeikis, last October. “When the Amtrak breaks down during my morning commute, I strip down to my tighty-whiteys” and push it “all the way to Washington!”Can’t really see Mitch McConnell doing that, can you? Indeed, the Biden Moment is also born of contrast. Would The Onion put a shirtless John Kerry washing a Trans Am in the driveway of the State Department? Speaker Boehner wearing a ponytail at the Inauguration? Harry Reid getting banned for life from Dave & Buster’s restaurants (“following dozens of complaints from wait staff and numerous incidents”)? Actually those last few might be pretty funny.“THIS ISN’T HAPPENING. This isn’t real.” — Leslie Knope.It really is, it really is! Or at least sitcom real. That was actually Mr. Biden, the real V.P., standing before Leslie, the civic-possessed character played by Amy Poehler, on a recent “Parks and Recreation” episode. Leslie’s fiancé, Ben, surprised her by setting up the meeting with her mega-crush/idol during a trip to Washington. (In an earlier show, Leslie had declared that her ideal man would “have the brain of George Clooney and the body of Joe Biden.”)“You must be Leslie Knope,” Mr. Biden says. “Welcome.”“You’re ... my name just came out of your mouth,” Leslie swoons.“Well, yeah, it did,” he replies.Leslie stammers, clutches the V.P., demurs on his nonexistent offer of Hillary Clinton’s secretary of state job. She caresses Mr. Biden’s face. Nonplused but still welcoming, his reaction is perfect.“You’re very handsome, by the way,” Leslie adds, clutching his arms. Walking out, she turns sharply to a Secret Service agent. “Don’t let anything happen to him, you understand me?” she says firmly. “He is precious cargo.”The scene was shot in two takes last July and was broadcast a few days after the election in November. Ms. Poehler praised Mr. Biden on the NBC Web site for keeping his composure “while I harassed him and invaded his personal space.”Personal space invasion is also a big part of Mr. Biden’s repertory. His relentless flirtation with the mother of Senator John Barrasso at the swearing-in was particularly for-the-ages: it included Mr. Biden touching her face, resting his hand high under her arm during the photo pose, throwing his arm around her at various times, speaking about two inches from her nose and pulling her close for another hug while the two of them posed for a special photo. “I’m 90 years old,” Louise Barrasso told him, to which the V.P. said, “I’ll tell you what, 20 years from now, when I show my kids this picture, you will have to come and sign it.” He gave her one last peck on the cheek and a “God love ya.”One of the keys of Mr. Biden’s comedic appeal is his willingness to play along. “A smart politician just goes with it,” said Ted Widmer, a historian at Brown University and a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. Mr. Widmer said the vice president’s embrace of the Onion’s fixation on him shows a level of acceptance that other politicians can learn from. “These things can’t be stopped anyway,” Mr. Widmer said. “It’s a virus, out of control. So you might as well participate and have fun. It shows a quality of humanity.”This was on shiny display last week — like a showroom Corvette — as The Onion released its e-book autobiography of Mr. Biden. The Onion Biden — a k a “Diamond” Joe Biden — participated in a Reddit “Ask Me Anything” thread to promote “The President of Vice.”To top that, the vice president himself — the real precious cargo! — tweeted in, declaring “#imavetteguy” to his Onion alter-ego. This was later re-tweeted by the president’s account.Personally, my favorite image from the whole Biden Moment occurred during a brief interlude at the end of the Senate swearing-in parade. When there were no more senators left to initiate, photos to mug for or moms to hug, Mr. Biden stood at the front of the chamber looking out at the emptying room. For a split second, he looked lost, maybe even sad. He folded his hands at his waist, twiddled his thumbs and then, with his eyes twinkling again, put out a last plaintive call: “Anyone else want to be sworn in as a Senator today?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/science/donald-hornig-a-bomb-scientist-and-brown-president-dies-at-92.html,"In a small shed at the top of a 100-foot-tall steel tower deep in the New Mexico desert, Donald Hornig sat next to the world’s first atomic bomb in the late evening of July 15, 1945, reading a book of humorous essays. A storm raged, and he shuddered at each lightning flash.It was his second trip to the tower that day as part of the Manhattan Project, the secret American effort to build an atomic bomb. He had earlier armed the device, code-named Trinity, connecting switches he had designed to the detonators.But J. Robert Oppenheimer, the scientific director of the project, had grown nervous about leaving the bomb alone. He told Dr. Hornig to return to the tower and baby-sit the bomb.A little after midnight, the weather had improved, and Dr. Hornig was ordered down from the tower. He was the last man to leave and the last to see the weapon before it changed human history.A little more than five miles away, Dr. Oppenheimer and others waited in a bunker to see if the device they called “the gadget” would actually go off. After Dr. Hornig joined them, he took his position for his next task: placing his finger on a console switch that when pressed would abort the blast, should anything appear awry. The countdown began, his finger at the ready.The bomb was detonated at 5:29:45 a.m. on July 16 as Dr. Hornig and the others watched from the bunker. He later remembered the swirling orange fireball filling the sky as “one of the most aesthetically beautiful things I have ever seen.”Three weeks later, an atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima. Three days after that, another fell on Nagasaki.It was the dawn of the nuclear age and also of a career that took Dr. Hornig to the White House as science adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson and to academic eminence as the president of Brown University in Providence, R.I., where he died on Monday at 92, his family said.Dr. Hornig worked under Johnson from 1964 to 1969, conferring with him on space missions and atom smashers as well as on more practical matters, like providing sufficient hospital beds for Medicare patients and desalting water for drinking.He had actually been President John F. Kennedy’s choice for science adviser. Kennedy had asked him to take the job shortly before his assassination in 1963, and Johnson followed through with the appointment.Working for Johnson was reportedly not easy. The president was said to disdain scientists and academics after so many of them had voiced opposition to the Vietnam War, which made it difficult for his science adviser to lobby for them.But when a power blackout hit the Northeast in 1965, the president turned to Dr. Hornig for guidance, as he did when earthquakes hit Denver. After Senator Robert F. Kennedy was assassinated in 1968, Johnson sought Dr. Hornig’s advice on ways to detect concealed weapons.Under Johnson, Dr. Hornig doubled the budget of what is now the Office of Science and Technology Policy, which he led, and pushed for federal research in housing and transportation. He also helped kill a proposal to put giant mirrors into orbit over Vietnam to spotlight the enemy at night.As the president of Brown from 1970 to 1976, Dr. Hornig established a four-year medical school. He oversaw the merger of Pembroke College, Brown University’s women’s school, with Brown College, the men’s undergraduate school. He faced student protests, including a 40-hour sit-in at Brown’s administrative building, over cost cutting, minority admissions and other matters.He met some student demands but later declared that the university would never again negotiate with students occupying a building. He described his presidency as “bittersweet.”Donald Frederick Hornig was born on March 17, 1920, in Milwaukee and attended Harvard, earning his undergraduate degree there in 1940 and his Ph.D. in 1943, both in chemistry. His dissertation was titled “An Investigation of the Shock Wave Produced by an Explosion,” and he went to work at the Underwater Explosives Laboratory of the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute in Massachusetts.He joined the Manhattan Project after his boss at Woods Hole passed along a mysterious invitation asking him to take an unspecified job at an unspecified location. No explanations were offered, and Dr. Hornig declined. James B. Conant, the president of Harvard, helped persuade him to change his mind.Dr. Honig and his new wife, the former Lilli Schwenk, bought an old Ford with frayed tires and puttered to New Mexico. His wife, who also had a Ph.D. in chemistry, worked for the project as a typist, and then as a scientist.Dr. Hornig is survived by his wife, as well as two daughters, Joanna Hornig Fox and Ellen Hornig; a son, Christopher; a brother, Arthur; a sister, Arlene Westfahl; nine grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren. His daughter Leslie Elizabeth Hornig died last year.After World War II, Dr. Hornig was a professor and a dean at Brown and then moved to Princeton as the chairman of the chemistry department. While at Princeton, he was on President Dwight D. Eisenhower’s scientific advisory committee.Dr. Hornig was briefly a vice president at the Eastman Kodak Company before accepting Brown’s presidency. After leaving Brown, he taught at Harvard’s public health school, retiring in 1990. He was one of the youngest scientists ever elected to the National Academy of Sciences."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/world/americas/chavez-is-optimistic-says-venezuelan-vice-president.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela — President Hugo Chávez is experiencing the “best moment” yet of his recovery from cancer surgery, Vice President Nicolás Maduro said Saturday.He emphatically added that Mr. Chávez would return to Venezuela take charge of the government again.Mr. Maduro spoke on his return from Cuba, where Mr. Chávez had surgery on Dec. 11.“The commander is in the best moment that we have seen him in all these days of struggle and battle,” Mr. Maduro said. “He is smiling, he has a look full of light, he has a special illumination in his thought.”Mr. Maduro said that Mr. Chávez had asked him to deliver a brief message to Venezuelans.“He said tell the people that he is optimistic and has lots of faith in what we’re doing,” Mr. Maduro said, adding that Mr. Chávez was referring to his medical treatment. He said the president was “holding tight to Christ and to life.”He went on to predict Mr. Chávez’s return, but did not say when that might occur.“This blessed land of the Liberator will see our commander president, it will see him, in his time, in his time it will see him here,” Mr. Maduro said. “We’re going to have him, as he should be, as president, in charge of our country.”Mr. Chávez has not been seen since his surgery last month. Unlike the president’s previous trips to Cuba for treatment, this time there have been no photographs or videos or television appearances, and Mr. Chávez has not called in to government-run television programs to make his voice heard.The political opposition has demanded more information about his condition and has asked for a team of medical experts to travel to Cuba to get an update on his health, but the government has rebuffed those requests.Mr. Chávez has refused to say what kind of cancer he has or exactly where it was found in his body. Government officials have not offered many details about his most recent cancer surgery, his fourth since June 2011. But on Saturday, Information Minister Ernesto Villegas said that the purpose of the surgery was “to remove a malignant lesion in the pelvis.” He added that Mr. Chávez had overcome a severe lung infection that occurred after the surgery and was now receiving additional medical treatment, which he did not describe.Mr. Chávez, who was re-elected in October, was unable to return to Venezuela for the inauguration for his new term, which began Jan. 10. The long absence has plunged the country into uncertainty and has led many to question whether he will be able to regain his health and continue as president."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/politics/tom-harkin-of-iowa-wont-seek-re-election-to-senate.html,"WASHINGTON — Senator Tom Harkin, the Democrat from Iowa who championed landmark legislation banning discrimination against people with disabilities, said Saturday that he would retire and not seek re-election next year to a sixth term.The announcement from Mr. Harkin sets the stage for one of the most competitive Senate races in the country in the 2014 midterm elections. It will be a crucial contest in the Republican Party’s quest to win control of the chamber from Democrats.“It’s not easy to walk away, but life is fleeting,” Mr. Harkin, 73, said in an interview Saturday. “I’ve had the privilege to be here for 40 years. Too many people hang on to power for too long, and that’s not right.”In a Washington career that began in 1974 with his election to the House, which was followed a decade later by his elevation to the Senate, Mr. Harkin has been a forceful voice of populism. He said his biggest achievement was the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990, a bipartisan measure he pushed for on behalf of his brother Frank, who was deaf. He was also a leading proponent of overhauling the nation’s health care system.Mr. Harkin sought the Democratic presidential nomination in 1992. But he has played a larger role in subsequent races for the White House as a fierce supporter of the Iowa caucuses that traditionally open the presidential campaign. Barack Obama, as a freshman senator from Illinois, made his Iowa debut at the state’s marquee political event in 2006, the Harkin Steak Fry.The announcement from Mr. Harkin took some Democrats by surprise on Saturday, particularly because he had not signaled his intentions and had a campaign account of nearly $3 million. His is the latest in a series of Senate retirements, and it forces Democrats to try to defend an open seat that would have otherwise been more challenging for Republicans.“I appreciate that Senator Harkin has made this decision so early in the cycle, giving us ample time to recruit a strong Democratic candidate for this seat,” said Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado, the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “Iowa has a strong record of electing great Democrats, and I’m confident that we will elect a new Democratic senator.”Representative Bruce Braley is among the party’s early prospects for Mr. Harkin’s seat. Mr. Braley had been considering running for governor, but aides said Mr. Harkin’s retirement made it certain that Mr. Braley would try to follow the example of Mr. Harkin and jump from the House to the Senate.Republicans, who need to pick up six seats to win control of the Senate, will probably draw a wide field of candidates. Party officials said one early contender could be Representative Steve King, who has drawn criticism from other Republicans for his outspoken opposition to changing the nation’s immigration system.The race in Iowa, one of the nation’s consummate swing states, is still a challenge for Republicans and will be a critical test for the party as it tries to rebuild and recruit candidates who have a wider appeal to voters. Overhauling immigration laws is a top priority of many Republican leaders, and a candidacy by Mr. King could complicate those efforts.Rob Collins, the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said Saturday that Mr. Harkin’s planned retirement “immediately vaults Iowa into the top tier of competitive Senate races next year.”In addition to Mr. Harkin, Senator John D. Rockefeller IV, Democrat of West Virginia, has said he will not seek re-election for a sixth term, and there may be other Democratic senators who retire. The party also is contending with a race in Massachusetts, where the successor to Senator John Kerry, who was nominated to serve as secretary of state, will stand for election in November 2014.Republicans face retirements of their own, including Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, who announced on Friday that he would not seek re-election next year. He was facing criticism from conservatives and could have faced a Republican primary challenge."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/media/from-barbasol-shaving-advice-across-the-generations.html,"A BRAND born in 1919 is joining the parade of products hoping to define what it means to be a man today.Barbasol shaving cream, sold by Perio Inc., is to begin a cheeky campaign on Monday that carries the theme “Shave like a man.” The campaign includes commercials on television and radio; advertisements online; the Barbasol Web site, barbasol.com; promotional T-shirts with sayings that include “It’s like America on your face”; and a presence on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.In fact, behavior on social media is among the subjects that the campaign tackles. To make the message seem less scolding or preachy, the TV commercials take an offbeat tack: manly archetypes of the past — a pioneer on the Oregon Trail in 1854, a baseball player in 1920, a G.I. fighting in 1944 — talk directly to their current-day male descendants.The commercial featuring the soldier begins with the actor speaking to the camera. “Oh, hey, buddy, your great-granddad here,” he says. “In case you haven’t noticed, I’m kind of busy here fighting for your freedom in the Second World War.“But now, you’re using that freedom to hurl insults at celebrities on Twitter?” he says. “Listen, hashtag, if you’re not going to fight like a man, at least shave like a man.”The spot ends with the soldier barking, “And stop L.O.L.’ing everything.” The other television commercials mock 21st-century habits like channel-surfing and juice cleanses.The ads are to run on cable channels with large male audiences, like AMC, the Big Ten Network, CBS Sports, ESPN, the MLB Network and Spike.The campaign is the first work for Barbasol by its new creative agency, GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group. Plans call for ad spending to be increased significantly from recent years, when Barbasol ran an earnest campaign that carried the theme “Close shave America.”Barbasol is not alone in using a wry, wink-wink tone to comment on the state of modern man in a nonconfrontational way.Other companies taking a similar approach include Brut, with a campaign carrying the theme “Let your man out,” and Old Spice, with ads that entreat the target audience to “Smell like a man, man.”It is no coincidence that Brut, Old Spice and Barbasol are all venerable brands that want to sharpen their appeal to younger men while at the same time holding on to current customers.“We have such a good, core group of older, loyal fans, and we didn’t want to alienate them,” said Ken Waldron, vice president for advertising at Perio Inc. in Columbus, Ohio.The device of the “ancestors” speaking to viewers “plays into our heritage and works for the older generation,” he said, and the humor of the improbable intergenerational advice appeals to men in their 20s and 30s.Many younger consumers prefer advertising aimed at them to be humorous, and are more likely to “like” funny ads on social media and share them with friends, Mr. Waldron said.“But humor is hard to do,” he said — and that is one of the reasons Perio chose to work with GSD&M. Mr. Waldron cited the agency’s work for a longtime client, Southwest Airlines, whose campaigns carry lighthearted themes like “Wanna get away?” and “You are now free to move about the country.”Duff Stewart, chief executive at GSD&M, said the agency’s efforts for Barbasol began with this question: “How do you take a historic brand, with all that heritage, and make it relevant today?”“There’s a nostalgia for the traditional concept of manhood,” Mr. Stewart said, and a desire for “getting back to what’s real.”But if the ads had expressed those ideas in an overly serious manner, he said, some people might have found them antagonistic.Instead, said Jake Camozzi, creative director at GSD&M, the agency sought “a unique way to poke a little fun at the cultural trends that are happening today,” without seeming to mock viewers or make them the “butt of the joke.”The goal was to produce something that men would respond to by saying, “It has a little bit of irreverence to it, but it’s the truth,” Mr. Camozzi said.Thus was born what Mr. Camozzi called the hook of the campaign: “the guy from the past telling you to shape up.”“It came from a familial truth,” he said, likening the discussion to “an uncle at the table talking to the younger generation” — in a good-natured manner, not scolding.Barbasol is also “a brand with humor in its heritage,” Mr. Camozzi said. For instance, a vintage print ad with a photograph of a beaming bald man carried the headline, “I like Barbasol so well I shave all over.”The primary competitors for Barbasol are Edge, sold by Energizer Holdings, and various Gillette products, sold by Procter & Gamble, including Gillette Foamy, Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Series.Perio spent $3.7 million to advertise Barbasol in major media in 2011, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, compared with $2.7 million in 2010 and $2.9 million in 2009. The total for the first nine months of last year was $2 million."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/television/stanley-karnow-historian-and-journalist-dies-at-87.html,"Stanley Karnow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and journalist who produced acclaimed books and television documentaries about Vietnam and the Philippines in the throes of war and upheaval, died on Sunday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 87.The cause was congestive heart failure, said Mr. Karnow’s son, Michael.For more than three decades Mr. Karnow was a correspondent in Southeast Asia, working for Time, Life, The Saturday Evening Post, The Washington Post, NBC News, The New Republic, King Features Syndicate and the Public Broadcasting Service. But he was best known for his books and documentaries.He was in Vietnam in 1959, when the first American advisers were killed, and lingered long after the guns fell silent, talking to fighters, villagers, refugees, North and South Vietnamese political and military leaders, the French and the Americans, researching a people and a war that had been little understood.The result was the 750-page book “Vietnam: A History,” published in 1983, and its companion, a 13-hour PBS documentary, “Vietnam: A Television History.” Unlike many books and films on Vietnam in the 1960s and ’70s and the nightly newscasts that focused primarily on America’s role and its consequences at home and abroad, Mr. Karnow addressed all sides of the conflict and traced Vietnam’s culture and history.“Vietnam: A History” was widely praised and a best seller. The documentary, with Mr. Karnow as chief correspondent, was at the time the most successful ever produced by public television, viewed by an average of nearly 10 million people a night through 13 episodes. It won six Emmy Awards, as well as Peabody, Polk and duPont-Columbia awards.Six years later, Mr. Karnow delivered his second comprehensive book and television examination of a Southeast Asian nation. The book, “In Our Image: America’s Empire in the Philippines” (1989), was a panorama of centuries of Filipino life under Spanish and American colonial rule, followed by independence under sometimes corrupt American-backed leaders. It won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for history.Narrated by Mr. Karnow, the three-part PBS documentary “The U.S. and the Philippines: In Our Image” traced America’s paternalistic colonial rule in the Philippines, the shared suffering of Filipinos and Americans under a cruel Japanese occupation in World War II, and Manila’s postwar independence under regimes nominally democratic but repressive, corrupt or indifferent to the miseries of its people.Mr. Karnow also wrote “Mao and China: From Revolution to Revolution” (1972) and was a co-author of or contributor to books based on his years in Asia, including “Asian-Americans in Transition” (1992), “Passage to Vietnam” (1994), “Mekong” (1995) and “Historical Atlas of the Vietnam War” (1995).Early in his career he lived in Paris for a decade, and in 1997 he published a memoir, “Paris in the Fifties.” A nostalgic reporter’s notebook of life among the cafe philosophers, bereted musicians and pseudo-revolutionary artistes, it danced with digressions about taxes, restaurants, the guillotine, Hemingway, Charles de Gaulle and the Devil’s Island penal colony.In its range, learning and appetite for fun, Bernard Kalb, the former CBS reporter and Mr. Karnow’s friend since Vietnam, told The Associated Press in 2009, the memoir was vintage Karnow. “Stanley has a great line about how being a journalist is like being an adolescent all your life,” he said.Stanley Karnow was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 4, 1925, the son of Harry and Henriette Koeppel Karnow. He grew up in a city with more than a dozen daily newspapers and decided early that he wanted to become a reporter. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II. After graduating from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in 1947, he sailed for France, intending to spend the summer. He stayed for a decade.Mr. Karnow married Claude Sarraute in 1948. They were divorced in 1955. In 1959, he married Annette Kline. They had two children, Michael and Catherine, who survive him, along with a stepson, Curtis Karnow, and two grandchildren. His second wife died in 2009.He studied politics at the University of Paris in 1948-49, and from 1950 to 1957 was a Paris correspondent for Time magazine, covering Western Europe and North Africa. As Algeria’s war of independence shook France with increasing violence, Mr. Karnow was posted to North Africa in 1958.In 1959 Mr. Karnow moved to Southeast Asia, established a base in Hong Kong and traveled widely in a region rife with conflicts. He was not typical of the Western correspondents, most of whom worked for one publication, dropped into war zones or political hot spots, wrote a few articles and moved on. He often had more than one employer, including weekly newsmagazines and other publications without daily deadlines, and he was drawn to reporting in greater depth and longer, more analytical writing forms.Mr. Karnow was an Asian correspondent for Time-Life from 1959 to 1962, The London Observer from 1961 to 1965, The Saturday Evening Post from 1963 to 1965 and The Washington Post from 1965 to 1971. He was a diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Post in 1971 and 1972, and a special correspondent for NBC and an associate editor of The New Republic from 1973 to 1975.In his first book, “Southeast Asia” (1962), an illustrated Life World Library volume, he noted that Ngo Dinh Diem, South Vietnam’s authoritarian anti-Communist president, was in danger of being overthrown. In November 1963, President Diem was slain in a military coup that the Kennedy administration had tacitly endorsed.Besides reporting periodically from Vietnam, Mr. Karnow covered news events across the region, including President Richard M. Nixon’s historic trip to China in 1972, for The Washington Post. Although he was one of 87 news representatives chosen by the White House to accompany Nixon to China, Mr. Karnow was also on the White House “enemies list” made public by the Senate Watergate committee in 1973.As China emerged from decades of isolation, Mr. Karnow’s book “Mao and China” examined the nation’s history from the Communist revolution through the Cultural Revolution, and also looked at Chairman Mao’s often conflicting roles in the period.After the Vietnam War Mr. Karnow was a columnist for King Features from 1975 to 1988, wrote for the French newsweekly Le Point from 1976 to 1983 and for Newsweek International from 1977 to 1981, and was an editor with the International Writers Service from 1976 to 1986.He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1958 and was a recipient of many awards, including the Shorenstein Prize for reporting on Asia."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/obama-and-clinton-appear-on-60-minutes.html,"WASHINGTON — They sat side by side, trading laughs and finishing each other’s thoughts. Five years ago, the very prospect of such a moment would have been “improbable,” as one of them put it.But now as the improbable partnership between President Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton winds down with her pending departure from the cabinet, the two rivals-turned-allies sent a public signal of solidarity on Sunday — at a time when one has run his last election and the other is contemplating one more.The unusual joint interview with Mr. Obama and Mrs. Clinton on the CBS News program “60 Minutes” was noteworthy mainly because it happened. Neither broke much ground in describing the journey that took them from bitter opponents for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 to collaborators in dealing with terrorism, war, diplomacy and global economics.But the picture of comity was presumably what the White House wanted when it proposed the interview to CBS in the first place.“I consider Hillary a strong friend,” Mr. Obama said.“Very warm, close,” Mrs. Clinton said.The two laughed off the meaning of the interview for the 2016 election, when many Democrats expect Mrs. Clinton to run again. Mr. Obama could hardly endorse her when his vice president, Joseph R. Biden Jr., appears to be angling for the party’s nomination as well.“You guys in the press are incorrigible,” Mr. Obama told Steve Kroft when he asked about the 2016 race during the interview, which was taped last week. “I was literally inaugurated four days ago, and you’re talking about elections four years from now.”Mrs. Clinton suggested that it might even be illegal for her to answer. “I am still secretary of state,” she said, “so I’m out of politics. And I’m forbidden from even hearing these questions.”Mrs. Clinton said she was still recovering from the concussion she suffered last month after falling and hitting her head. Among other things, she has to wear glasses for the time being instead of contact lenses. “I have some lingering effects from the concussion that are decreasing and will disappear,” she said. “But I have a lot of sympathy now when I pick up the paper and read about an athlete or one of our soldiers who’s had traumatic brain injury.”Mr. Obama defended himself against criticism that he has been too passive on the world stage, pointing to his intervention in Libya, where a revolution aided by NATO warplanes led to the death of the country’s longtime dictator. “Muammar Qaddafi probably does not agree with that assessment,” Mr. Obama said of the criticism, “or at least if he was around, he wouldn’t agree with that assessment.”The president lavished praise on Mrs. Clinton for her discipline, stamina and talent. And they put a glossy shine on history by brushing off the tough primary attacks five years ago as the product of trying to find differences where, they now say, there actually were not that many.“Despite our hard-fought primary, we had such agreement on what needed to be done for our country,” Mrs. Clinton said.“Made for tough debates, by the way,” Mr. Obama added, “because we could never figure out what we were different on.”“Yeah, we worked at that pretty hard,” she said.As for any residual bad feelings, they said it had taken their aides longer to get over it than it had taken them. “What did evolve was a friendship, as opposed to just a professional relationship,” Mr. Obama said. “Friendships involve a sense of trust and being in the foxhole together. And that emerged during the course of months when we were making some very tough decisions.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/media/the-new-republic-aims-to-broaden-its-audience.html,"WASHINGTON — There are not many firsts for a politically savvy, 98-year-old publication like The New Republic. But Franklin Foer, its 38-year-old editor, experienced one recently when he passed a Hudson News store at Union Station here and saw the magazine displayed prominently near the checkout.It’s all part of the plan by Chris Hughes, the 29-year-old co-founder of Facebook, former online campaign adviser to President Obama and The New Republic’s newest owner, to turn around the magazine he bought in March.To Mr. Foer, the sight was thrilling.“It felt like for the past 10 years, the magazine was just trying to stay afloat,” he said. “There were real limits on our ambitions.”Sitting in the K Street offices that The New Republic is renting until it relocates to a space above the International Spy Museum, Mr. Foer said that Mr. Hughes had energized the magazine. “He really thinks of it as a start-up, and that’s exhilarating,” he said. On Monday, readers will be able to see the fruits of Mr. Hughes’s investment for the first time when The New Republic unveils its redesigned print magazine, Web site and app.The magazine, which has long been the journalism equivalent of high-fiber pasta, even for media-hungry political devotees, embraces a broader mix of political reporting and what Mr. Hughes described as “the high and low in the artistic world.”Mr. Hughes said that while the magazine would continue to have arts critics review subjects like books and visual arts, he is just as interested in covering topics like electronica and the HBO series “Girls.”The initial issue reflects the effort to offer more diverse fare: it features an exclusive interview with Mr. Obama, an essay by Walter Kirn, the author of “Up in the Air,” about his personal use of guns, and an article by Judith Shulevitz, a former editor at Lingua Franca and Slate, about why society needs grandmothers.A new feature called “From the Stacks” will highlight pieces from prominent writers who contributed to the magazine in the past; this month’s entry is Edmund Wilson’s dispatch from Franklin D. Roosevelt’s first inauguration. The magazine’s redesigned book reviews include a critique by Michael Lewis of Greg Smith’s book, “Why I Left Goldman Sachs: A Wall Street Story.”The app and Web site have new, technologically friendly features, like audio versions of articles and the ability to let users read pieces on multiple devices, continuing on one at the spot where they left off on another.“We’re holding onto the heritage of the magazine while trying to make it more responsive to what people are interested in and how they read in 2013,” Mr. Hughes said.Behind the scenes, Mr. Hughes and Mr. Foer have been engaged in a delicate balancing act: trying to include The New Republic’s rich history in a magazine designed for the modern media age.In a nod to the past, they not only incorporated “From the Stacks,” but also hired back a longtime editor, Michael Kinsley, to do a series of profiles. To build its future, Mr. Hughes more than doubled the staff, added a New York bureau for the first time since World War II and hired the magazine’s first in-house art department.Mr. Foer said that Mr. Hughes had gently led the twice-a-month magazine out of its college newspaper culture in which editors pulled all-nighters, and put in place a far more organized system in which articles are planned weeks in advance.Mr. Hughes and Mr. Foer also added women’s voices to a magazine that has long been short on them, by hiring Julia Ioffe, a former writer for The New Yorker, and Noreen Malone, a former writer for New York Magazine.Staff members say that working for the revamped magazine reminds them of media start-ups they have worked at like Slate and George, only with the gravity that comes with The New Republic’s past.“It’s as though you’re expanding and reconfiguring a house that has great bones,” Mr. Kirn said. “There are a lot of cues as to how to go forth that come from the original design. But the world has changed.”Mr. Hughes acknowledged that he was slower in transforming the magazine’s business side. But he hired a new head of advertising in November and moved most of that business to New York.On a recent Friday, Mr. Hughes had just returned to his half-decorated New York office from Detroit, where he made a presentation on the magazine to automotive advertisers. As for circulation, Mr. Hughes has even more catching up to do, since The New Republic’s previous owners stopped having its circulation audited in 2005.Since he bought the magazine, subscriptions have grown to 44,177, from 34,000 since March, he said. (In 1993, at the magazine’s peak, the circulation was 102,392, according to the Alliance for Audited Media.) Newsstand sales have increased by 68 percent, to an average of 1,738 copies sold for the last five issues, from 1,034 copies an issue in 2011.In the meantime, Mr. Hughes’s background at Facebook and his experience with the Obama campaign have helped The New Republic’s presence on social media. It has gained 31 percent more Facebook fans and 93 percent more Twitter followers since he took over.Despite these early signs of progress, the road to profitability is uncertain. The demise of Newsweek’s print edition last year is a grim reminder of how difficult it can be for these types of general interest magazines to survive.Fareed Zakaria, former editor of Newsweek International and now a columnist for Time, said that despite his fondness for The New Republic, where he was an intern in 1986, he thought its primary purpose was not financial.“My impression is the goal here is not to make money, but to make an impact politically, culturally, intellectually,” he said.Mr. Hughes, who left Facebook with a fortune estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, later wrote in an e-mail that he expected the magazine to eventually be profitable.“The era of sizable margins for media companies in the late 20th century is probably over, but that doesn’t mean that consumers aren’t still willing to pay for content” Mr. Hughes said. “It is going to take us a couple years, but profitability is our goal.”Even Mr. Hughes’s presumed rivals seem to welcome competition in an industry rife with layoffs, declining advertising and an unclear future.“The challenges for any magazine of ambition have probably never been greater, but I’m rooting for them,” said David Remnick, the editor of The New Yorker. “If we get beat on a story once in a while, that occasional chagrin is nothing compared to having an intellectual and journalistic ecosystem that is healthy, rigorous and various.”The New Republic’s investment in journalism at a time of steep challenges is gratifying to the writers and editors who are part of it. Lisa DePaulo, a freelance writer who helped cover the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., recalled that Mr. Hughes had rented a house where the reporters could work and stay. She said that while the hours had been long, the group setting generated a lot of talk among the writers that reminded her of a magazine reporting culture of the past.“It’s what should be,” Ms. DePaulo said, “and what was lost.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/eric-cantor-the-gop-majority-leader-looks-beyond-debt.html,"WASHINGTON — With House Republicans gathered behind closed doors this month at a resort in Williamsburg, Va., Representative Eric Cantor hushed the crowd with a long slide presentation on the prospects of a government default.The federal debt was climbing quickly. The Treasury Department was using “extraordinary measures” to keep paying the nation’s debts, even if, technically, the government had blown past its borrowing limit. President Obama, he said, would set the day the government would go into default, and Republicans balking at raising the debt limit had no real idea when that day would be. The Republican Party was not in control of the situation.For Mr. Cantor, the majority leader, the goals during the ensuing week — from Williamsburg to the House vote last Wednesday to suspend the debt limit until May — were to make sure the government did not default on its debt in the coming weeks and to get House Republicans beyond an endless, and politically fruitless, discussion about debt, deficits and green-eyeshaded austerity.“We are in a town run by Democrats, and we cannot win the hearts and minds of Americans if we are just talking about numbers, day in and day out,” said a Cantor aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss his boss’s plans. “There are a lot of things Republicans care about.”After lying low for several months, Mr. Cantor is reasserting his presence in the Capitol, even as Speaker John A. Boehner continues his struggles to maintain Republican unity. In the coming weeks, the majority leader plans to lay out a second, softer track for his party beyond the constant cycle of budget showdowns and deficit talks.Notably, that track will include a new push for private-school vouchers for underprivileged children, health care options beyond the old fight over the president’s health care law, new work force training initiatives and a renewed push for science, technology and engineering visas for would-be immigrants.After successfully engineering the latest debt ceiling vote last week, Mr. Cantor flew to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he road-tested those themes as the lone House Republican leader rubbing elbows with the international elite.Citing a struggling single mother with a gifted child in a poor city neighborhood, he told Davos attendees, “We need to create some type of competitive mechanisms” to help her escape the bad schools she is stuck with. Between meetings with King Abdullah II of Jordan; President Shimon Peres of Israel; the International Monetary Fund director, Christine Lagarde; and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations, he spoke of “sane immigration policies,” unemployed youths and a German model for economic output.Mr. Cantor is expected to lay out his domestic vision on Feb. 5 at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right research group.His latest moves follow two episodes this month that attracted wide notice and new questions about Republican unity. He publicly broke with the speaker early this month over the deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, voting against the agreement even as Mr. Boehner voted for it. He then deftly maneuvered to secure passage of a Hurricane Sandy disaster relief package that Mr. Boehner had initially been cool to, bowing to pressure from financial donors in New York and engineering a complex process that satisfied both Northeastern Republicans and fiscal conservatives.On the train ride to the House Republican retreat in Williamsburg, Mr. Cantor, who represents a district in Virginia, walked the aisles and worked the back bench, asking members about their legislative interests and promising attention.Mr. Cantor’s actions lack what many saw in 2011, the first year of Republican House control, as overt disloyalty to Mr. Boehner. Instead, lawmakers and aides say, his eye may be on an emerging potential rival for the speakership, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee.Mr. Ryan has given no sign that he wants the job, but House Republicans say that if anyone can challenge Mr. Cantor for the job, it is Mr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman. Mr. Cantor appears to be shoring up his power before Mr. Boehner’s retirement, which many believe will come in four years, if not two.“I have never felt that there was any real reason to believe Eric is plotting and scheming against the speaker,” said Vin Weber, a former Republican House member who remains close to the leadership. “But when you’re in the leadership, you’re always looking over your shoulder, using your peripheral vision to see who might be coming up on you. That’s the nature of leadership.”Mr. Cantor’s supporters say his moves have nothing to do with leadership intrigue and everything to do with leadership — and with shaping the direction of the party after last year’s electoral defeats.After more than two years of budget fights, the majority leader, more than anyone else in the leadership, is said to want to broaden the discussion. His mantra behind closed doors is “How do we make life work better?” aides say, and he would like the next two years to be at least as much about job creation and economic opportunity as about spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs.Mr. Cantor’s votes — against the fiscal cliff deal but for $60 billion in disaster aid — may have lacked ideological consistency, but they do contain a common thread. All have been good for Mr. Cantor.The work he did for the aid package put him in a small minority of his party. The bill passed 241 to 180, but only 49 Republicans voted yes; 179, including Mr. Ryan, voted no. But its passage pleased rich New York donors like the venture capitalist Kenneth G. Langone and the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who pushed him hard for a vote after the speaker backed off the bill on the last day of the 112th Congress.Those donors, in turn, help keep Mr. Cantor’s two political action committees, the YG Action Fund and the Every Republican Is Crucial PAC, flush so he can spread largess to the young House Republicans who make up the core of his support. Goldman Sachs was the second-largest donor to ERIC PAC in the 2012 political cycle.“I certainly asked a good number of people in New York who he has relationships with to call him and ask for his support,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.Mr. Cantor stayed on the right side of House conservatives — and against Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan — when he shocked Republicans and opposed the last-minute deal that allowed taxes to rise on incomes over $400,000 while averting much broader tax increases that could have put the economy back into recession.The deal passed 257 to 167, but this time Mr. Cantor was with the majority of his conference. Just 85 Republicans voted for it, including Mr. Boehner, who rarely votes; 151 voted against.“This is all about the longer term,” one House Republican said. “Get rid of the image of being too grasping and ambitious. Cooperate with Boehner where it’s not going to hurt him, but don’t run risks in the short term.”Mr. Cantor is in a tricky position. If he becomes too closely associated with Mr. Boehner, he could be swept aside in the event of a broad leadership upheaval. But he cannot look like the architect of upheaval and risk losing the gavel in the melee.Mr. Cantor declined to be interviewed for this article. But Doug Heye, a Cantor spokesman, dismissed any talk of disunity. The top leaders are working well together, he said, but sometimes their beliefs will diverge.“When it comes to the cliff, when it comes to Sandy, he voted his conscience and what he thought was right,” Mr. Heye said of his boss.But even the hint of division is coming at a bad time, with Mr. Obama fresh off a convincing electoral victory and staking out uncompromising positions as the government careers toward the next fiscal deadlines: March 1, when nearly $1 trillion in across-the-board defense and domestic spending cuts begin; March 27, when the stopgap law financing the government expires; and May 16, when the new debt ceiling reprieve expires.“This is an unprecedented time for House Republican leadership,” said Ron Bonjean, who was an aide to J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, a former Republican speaker. “Never before have we lacked a consistent message due to the results of an election, with such high stakes ahead.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/opinion/the-politics-behind-the-guns-debate.html," To the Editor:As a Vietnam veteran, an owner of both a rifle and a pistol, and a not-so-successful sheep hunter, I am one of the millions of Americans with guns as part of our lives. I am also a father. Because I am all of the above I am profoundly thankful that President Obama has challenged us to live within both our rights and responsibilities to save the lives of innocent victims of gun violence.The horror of Newtown has shocked us into the realization that we must change. The families and friends of the victims of Columbine, Virginia Tech, Tucson and Aurora might ask why did it take so long. I don’t know the answer. And we will never know how many lives will be saved if we do act. All we know is the shame we must share if we don’t act.As a former elected official, I have seen the power of people to create change despite the opposition and clout of well-connected and well-financed organizations and lobbyists. So I proudly join all of the veterans, gun owners and hunters who understand and value the rights and responsibilities that come with gun ownership and have the backbone to state their case.Banning assault weapons, restricting ammunition magazines and requiring background checks on all sales are a start. It will not really change our lives as gun owners, but it may change the life of one innocent child by saving it.TONY KNOWLESAnchorage, Jan. 19, 2013The writer was governor of Alaska from 1994 to 2002.To the Editor:Re “Democrats in Senate Confront Doubts at Home on Gun Laws” (front page, Jan. 24):Some Democrats, especially in rural states, fear repercussions at the voting booth if they support legislation limiting any level of gun control. Those proposed limits include restrictions on assault weapons and large ammunition clips and additional screening of prospective gun buyers.Senators in states that manufacture weapons also fear negative economic consequences. They are even afraid to explain to their constituents that proposed legislation would not take away Second Amendment rights to own an arsenal of popular weapons.Perhaps I am completely naïve about politics, but this article did not even mention the possibility that one of our elected representatives might vote his or her conscience on this issue. It seems clear that at least some of our representatives believe that our current lack of gun limitations is unconscionable, but evidently less important than re-election.The National Rifle Association mocks common sense, ginning up false arguments to appease its base and stay in business. Do our representatives in Washington act any differently?JOHN VASISanta Barbara, Calif., Jan. 24, 2013To the Editor:Your article quotes Charlie Houck, a West Virginia banker, as saying, “We give up our rights one piece at a time.” Exactly right, sir.Yesterday morning my wife received a phone call — the local elementary school attended by my two little girls, ages 8 and 6, was locked down. My daughters spent their morning under their desks, terrified; I won’t describe my own or my wife’s state of mind.Later in the day dozens of guns were removed from a house across the street from the school by local and federal law enforcement agents. Yes, Mr. Houck, our rights are being taken away, including the right to live, unafraid, in a country that values the lives of children more than it values firearms.GEORGE OVITTAlbuquerque, Jan. 24, 2013"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/obama-seeks-to-keep-status-quo-despite-talk-of-move-to-left.html,"WASHINGTON — For all the talk that President Obama has shifted leftward, much of his early second-term energy seeks simply to preserve the status quo.Mr. Obama’s Inaugural Address last week celebrated the role of “collective action” in creating conditions for a modern economy, expanding individual opportunity and assisting the poor. He rejected Republican arguments that government benefits create “a nation of takers.”That partisan gibe was telling. He defended two programs, Medicare and Medicaid, begun nearly a half-century ago, and a third, Social Security, that dates from the Great Depression. The federal welfare commitments that Mr. Obama praised in observing that “a great nation must care for the vulnerable” also date back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s time.Yet all those benefits are in the cross-fire of the president’s continuing fiscal battle with Republicans in Congress. That is not because of a shift in philosophy by Mr. Obama or his party, but rather because of the looming cost of the retirements of baby boomers and of the persistent ideological boldness of partisan foes.Mr. Obama expanded the scope of federal obligations during his first term through short-term stimulus programs and the new health care law. Encouraged by his second popular-vote majority in November and hardened by his confrontations with Republicans over the past two years, he has taken a feistier stance toward his adversaries.None of the president’s economic initiatives, however, represent a departure for Mr. Obama himself, or for his party. If President Bill Clinton set out to build a “bridge to the 21st century,” said Simon Rosenberg, the president and founder of the New Democrat Network, Mr. Obama is walking across it.John D. Podesta, an Obama adviser who served as chief of staff in the Clinton White House, called the president’s second-term economic agenda “consistent with where he’s been, consistent with where Clinton was.”Indeed, since World War II both parties have accepted a substantial measure of federal activism “as American as apple pie,” said Kenneth Baer, a former Obama budget aide.Mr. Obama’s problem is that postwar America could afford more pie than a post-baby-boomer America will be able to. And in the era of the Tea Party, Republicans have proved increasingly willing to challenge once-settled assumptions about Washington’s role.In another political moment, Mr. Obama’s attempt to preserve old governing assumptions might be labeled conservative. But Republicans, even after shifting tactics in the wake of a bracing November defeat, say he will have to fight nonstop to advance his agenda.“His entire second term on fiscal issues is going to be essentially defensive,” said Representative Tom Cole, a veteran Republican from Oklahoma. “He’s trying to defend not just the New Deal legacy, but also Obamacare.”Mr. Cole added, “The problem he has is, those programs can’t be defended in their current forms.”But Republicans also have not made their case for the “structural reforms” that they say have been made urgent by trillion-dollar deficits. In fact, they have failed to do so repeatedly.In the 1990s, Speaker Newt Gingrich’s attempt to rein in Medicare and Medicaid spending helped Mr. Clinton win a second term. President George W. Bush, after adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, could not persuade a Republican Congress to pass his plan for a partial privatization of Social Security.In last year’s campaign, the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, backed a plan to overhaul Medicare through spending limits on each beneficiary. But their plan pushed such savings 10 years into the future, while they attacked Mr. Obama for having cut Medicare spending to help finance the health care law.When it comes to Republicans pushing for structural changes in benefit programs, “the record there is not good,” said Peter Wehner, a former Bush White House aide. And the Republican argument will not soon get easier to make.Mr. Obama acknowledges the need for some cuts in entitlement spending, but he campaigned successfully on higher taxes for affluent Americans as an alternative to the deep cuts that Republicans want. By refusing to negotiate this month over raising the nation’s borrowing limit, Mr. Obama forced Republican leaders to set that cudgel aside without accepting the spending cuts they previously insisted on.To swing rank-and-file Republicans behind that capitulation, House leaders promised that Mr. Ryan’s new budget plan this spring would eliminate the budget deficit within 10 years. Doing so, however, will almost certainly require limiting Medicare spending much sooner than 10 years from now — a step that Mr. Wehner said “I’m not sure I’d recommend,” because it could bring more political pain.Yet fiscal pressure on the White House will not let up even if Mr. Obama marshals public opinion against that budget. Absent a negotiated deal to reduce spending, Mr. Cole said, Republicans say they will let $1 trillion in 10-year across-the-board budget cuts take effect under the “sequestration” provision both parties agreed to in 2011. That would squeeze defense and domestic government functions alike.A deal remains possible. In earlier, unsuccessful talks with Republicans, Mr. Obama embraced what Mr. Podesta calls “sensible reforms” to major entitlement programs, including reduced spending for affluent beneficiaries and more modest inflation adjustments.Not even liberal advocates hold out much hope for new expansions in the government’s economic role, or crackdowns on the United States’ trading partners, or stimulus spending to reduce unemployment — notwithstanding Mr. Obama’s second-inaugural swagger.Upon hearing Mr. Obama’s address, “I was troubled by the assumption that the economy’s in recovery, when for most Americans the recovery hasn’t started,” said Robert L. Borosage, a co-director of the liberal Campaign for America’s Future.“He spoke to the progressive coalition,” Mr. Borosage added. But in some ways, he said, the speech “sounded like it came from the Clinton years.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/global/myanmar-signs-deal-with-world-bank-over-debt.html,"YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — The World Bank on Sunday announced a long-awaited deal to allow Myanmar to clear part of its huge decades-old foreign debt, opening the door for lending to jump-start its lagging economy.The bank’s Washington headquarters said in a statement that the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the country’s overseas development bank, will provide a bridge loan to Myanmar to allow it to cover outstanding debt to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which totals about $900 million.Myanmar stopped payments on its old loans in about 1987, making it ineligible for new development lending.The deal is a major breakthrough for Myanmar, with loans likely to go to upgrading its dilapidated infrastructure, including electricity and ports. A result could be to bring in more foreign direct investment, already attracted by the country’s relatively low-cost economy.The deal is also likely to draw criticism, because it comes as Myanmar’s army is pushing hard against ethnic Kachin rebels in the country’s north, echoing the counterinsurgency campaigns of previous military governments.A former general, Thein Sein, became the country’s elected president in 2011 and began reversing almost five decades of military repression by instituting political and economic reforms.He won the substantial easing of economic and political sanctions imposed against the junta by the United States and other nations. But some democracy activists say the rewards have been too much, too fast, allowing some abuses to continue, like repression of ethnic minorities.Myanmar ran up $8.4 billion of debt during the socialist government of Gen. Ne Win from 1962 to 1988, and $2.61 billion of debt after a new military junta took over in 1988, making for a total of a little more than $11 billion.The largest creditor before 1988 was Japan, with loans of $6.39 billion, and the biggest post-1988 creditor was China, with $2.13 billion."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/ryan-says-obama-ignores-fiscal-woes-to-fight-gop.html,"Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the former vice-presidential candidate, said on Sunday that President Obama was ignoring the nation’s problems and was choosing instead to focus on the “political conquest” of the Republican Party.“When you saw his speech, say, at the inauguration, it leads us to conclude that he’s not looking to moderate, that he’s not looking to move to the middle,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview on the NBC News program “Meet the Press.” “He’s looking to go farther to the left, and he wants to fight us every step of the way politically.”In his first major interview since the November election, Mr. Ryan also warned that more partisan gridlock was in store as lawmakers prepared to renew the debate over balancing the budget and raising the country’s debt limit. His remarks echoed those of other Republican leaders, including Speaker John A. Boehner, who said last week that Mr. Obama was seeking to “annihilate” the Republican Party.Republicans were put on the defensive after Mr. Obama’s inauguration speech, in which he laid out a starkly liberal vision for his second term, declaring his support for same-sex marriage, gun restrictions and changes in immigration laws.With his stature increased within the party, Mr. Ryan, who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, will increasingly be expected to set the tone for Republicans, particularly on fiscal issues.In a rebuke to the president on Sunday, Mr. Ryan said that if Hillary Rodham Clinton had beaten Mr. Obama in the Democratic primaries in 2008 and had gone on to win the presidency, “we would have fixed this fiscal mess by now.”“I don’t think that the president thinks that we actually have a fiscal crisis,” he said. “He’s been reportedly saying to our leaders that we don’t have a spending problem, we have a health care problem. That just leads me to conclude that he actually thinks we just need more government-run health care.”But Mr. Ryan acknowledged that the Republican Party needed to reach out to more Americans, and he signaled a willingness to compromise on some issues.“We obviously have to expand our appeal,” he said. “We have to show how our ideas are better at fighting poverty, how our ideas are better at solving health care, how our ideas are better at solving the problems that arise in people’s daily lives.”On immigration, he said he was hopeful that legislation could be passed this year, if Mr. Obama did not “play politics.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/americas/letter-said-to-be-from-chavez-read-at-summit-meeting.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela’s vice president read an 11-page letter bearing the signature of President Hugo Chávez to a regional summit meeting on Monday, the latest effort by the government to show that its absentee leader remains in charge.For more than six weeks, Mr. Chávez has not been seen in public and his voice has not been heard in Venezuela (except for a recording of him singing the national anthem and old videotapes shown repeatedly on television). He remains hospitalized in Cuba, where he underwent cancer surgery on Dec. 11.His silence has led to widespread speculation that he may be dying or that his illness is so severe that he may not be able to function as president. But government officials who have shuttled to Cuba insist that Mr. Chávez is instructing them and is in charge.The opposition criticized the government over the weekend, after officials announced that they would read the letter from Mr. Chávez at the summit meeting.“Someone who can sign letters and crack jokes, can’t he speak to the country?” Henrique Capriles, the opposition candidate who lost to Mr. Chávez in the October election, said on Sunday, referring to recent comments by the newly appointed foreign minister, Elías Jaua, who said that he had visited Mr. Chávez and that the two had joked and laughed. Mr. Capriles, a state governor, was quoted in the newspaper El Nacional on Monday.While officials have previously delivered messages that they say came from Mr. Chávez, Monday’s letter, signed in red ink, was the longest.Vice President Nicolás Maduro read it aloud to the heads of state and other officials attending the meeting in Santiago, Chile, of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States, an organization that Mr. Chávez helped found to promote regional cooperation. It excludes the United States and Canada.“As all of you know, since December of last year I am battling again for my health,” the letter said. “Because of that, these lines are a way to make myself present in this summit.”The letter included quotes from Simón Bolívar, the Venezuelan independence hero whom Mr. Chávez venerates, the Chilean poet Pablo Neruda and other Latin American writers and historical figures.It condemned the United States trade embargo against Cuba and sided with Argentina in its dispute with Britain over the Falkland Islands.Mr. Chávez said in the letter that he would be following events at the summit meeting from Havana.Television cameras showed Mr. Maduro reading the typed letter. Mr. Maduro visited Mr. Chávez in Cuba last week and said on Saturday that he had brought the letter back with him. He also said the president had sent a message to Venezuelans that he was optimistic about his medical treatment and was “holding tight to Christ and life.”Mr. Maduro has returned from other trips to Cuba with similar messages, although they have often been greeted with skepticism by the opposition.In late December, Mr. Maduro attended a military ceremony and read a five-page holiday greeting to the armed forces said to have been written by Mr. Chávez. But two days later, officials canceled New Year’s Eve celebrations in Caracas and urged people to pray for the president after announcing new health complications.Mr. Chávez was too sick to return to Venezuela to be sworn in for the new term on Jan. 10. A letter to the National Assembly informing legislators that Mr. Chávez would not attend the ceremony was signed by Mr. Maduro, prompting questions over why Mr. Chávez was unable to sign.Government officials now say Mr. Chávez’s condition is favorable, but they have declined to specify a homecoming date."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/us/politics/congress-faces-deep-seated-resistance-to-immigration-plan.html,"GREENVILLE, S.C. — At Tommy’s Country Ham House, a popular spot downtown for politics and comfort food, not much has changed since 2007, the last time conservatives here made it crystal clear to politicians how they felt about what they see as amnesty for people who entered the country illegally.“What we need to do is put them on a bus,” said Ken Sowell, 63, a lawyer from Greenville, as he ate lunch recently at the diner. “We need to enforce the border. If they want to apply legally more power to them. I don’t think just because a bunch of people violate the law, we ought to change the law for them.”Six years ago, the intensity of that kind of sentiment was enough to scuttle immigration overhaul efforts led by President George W. Bush and a bipartisan group of lawmakers, including Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, both Republicans.Now, as a new bipartisan group of eight senators, including Mr. Graham and Mr. McCain, try again — this time with President Obama as their partner in the White House — members of Congress will have to overcome deep-seated resistance like that expressed in the restaurant if they are to push legislation forward.Republicans are betting that opposition from Tea Party activists and the party’s most conservative supporters will have less impact because of the dire electoral consequences of continuing to take a hard line regarding immigrants. The senators on Monday released a blueprint for a new immigration policy that opens the door to possible citizenship ahead of a Tuesday speech on the subject by Mr. Obama in Las Vegas.There is some evidence that the politics of immigration may be changing. Sean Hannity, the conservative host at Fox News, said days after the 2012 presidential election that he has “evolved” on immigration and now supports a comprehensive approach that could “get rid of” the issue for Republicans. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, a rising star in the Republican Party, is pushing his own version of broad immigration changes — and getting praise from conservative icons like Grover Norquist and Ralph Reed.But the Republican-controlled House remains a big hurdle. Speaker John A. Boehner on Monday was noncommittal about the emerging proposal, with a spokesman saying that Mr. Boehner “welcomes the work of leaders like Senator Rubio on this issue, and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal.”Representative Lamar Smith, Republican of Texas and a senior member of the Judiciary Committee, said that “when you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration.”And if the lunch rush conversation at Tommy’s is any indication, many Republican lawmakers will soon return home to find their constituents just as opposed to the idea as they were before. Concern about immigration varies regionally. But in many Congressional districts around the country, the prospect of intense opposition carries with it the threat of a primary challenger if Republican lawmakers stray too far from hawkish orthodoxy on the issue.“The people who are coming across the border — as far as I’m concerned, they are common criminals,” said Bill Storey, 68, a retired civil engineer from Greenville. “We should not adopt policies to reward them for coming into this country illegally. I have all the regard for them in the world if they come through the legal system, but not the illegal system.”Charlie Newton, a construction worker in the Greenville area, praised the work ethic of Hispanic co-workers, but said he opposes any laws that would provide benefits to illegal immigrants, including help becoming citizens.“I think we need to help our own people before we keep helping somebody else,” he said.The president’s proposals are expected to include more border enforcement, work site verification systems that allow employers to check the status of their employees online, and a road map to citizenship for the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants now living in the country. Democratic senators could begin work on a bill in the next couple of weeks.In the Fourth Congressional District in South Carolina, which includes Greenville, the formal arrival of such a plan is likely to anger the constituents of Trey Gowdy, a Republican House member who was elected in the 2010 Tea Party wave and is now the chairman of a key subcommittee that will deal with immigration.Mr. Gowdy has already taken a hard line, signing on last year to the “Prohibiting Backdoor Amnesty Act,” which aimed to reverse Mr. Obama’s plans to delay deportations for some young illegal immigrants. The congressman will be under pressure to change his mind from the White House and its allies, including groups like the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. But when he goes home to Greenville, Mr. Gowdy may find that his constituents want him to hold firm in his opposition.“If you had to go find the heartburn, you’d find it in Greenville,” said Katon Dawson, a former chairman of the Republican Party in South Carolina. Mr. Dawson, who supports comprehensive immigration changes, said the matter was likely to become a hot-button issue again, as it was in 2006 and 2007.“All I’d ever hear is, ‘Why don’t you enforce the laws that we already have?’ And then I’d hear, ‘Why don’t you just build the fence?’ ” Mr. Dawson said, describing the comments he expects to hear again during the immigration debate.Mr. Gowdy referred questions about the immigration debate to the Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Representative Robert W. Goodlatte of Virginia. But veterans of South Carolina politics say the reaction in his district, and others like it across the country, will help determine the fate of the national legislation.Bruce Bannister, the Republican majority leader of the South Carolina House of Representatives, said much of that response will depend on how the White House and its allies in Washington frame the debate.“The amnesty provisions that got everybody fired up — I think you’re not going to see states like South Carolina ever support that, even though we recognize that shipping or sending home all the folks that came here illegally is almost impossible,” Mr. Bannister, who represents Greenville, said.Josh Kimbrall, a conservative radio talk show host in South Carolina, agrees with Mr. Bannister. Mr. Kimbrall supports immigration law changes, but says Republicans like Mr. Bush and Mr. McCain allowed their effort in 2007 to be portrayed in a bad light by opponents.“It’s how you message it,” Mr. Kimbrall said. “In Greenville, it’s the rule of law. As soon as the word amnesty is thrown in, very few people are willing to go along.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/an-italian-bank-caught-in-the-vortex-of-election-politics.html,"MILAN — The chief executive of a regional Italian bank embroiled in a scandal with political and even Europe-wide implications said Monday that recent revelations of past mismanagement and questionable deals would not impede efforts to turn around the beleaguered institution.“This is still a solid bank,” Fabrizio Viola, chief executive of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, said Monday at a news conference in Milan.In the past week revelations of transactions that may have disguised the extent of the bank’s losses during the global financial crisis have become political fodder ahead of Italy’s national elections next month.And the disclosures have raised questions about the degree of scrutiny given Monte dei Paschi di Siena by Mario Draghi, who was still head of Italy’s central bank when the problems developed. Mr. Draghi, of course, is now president of the European Central Bank.At issue is whether Monte dei Paschi di Siena, or M.P.S. as it is known, hid losses it incurred after acquiring the Italian bank Antonveneta in 2008, for €9 billion — a price that even at the time was widely derided as far too high. Now under scrutiny are two complex transactions M.P.S. conducted with Deutsche Bank and Nomura that critics say enabled M.P.S. to mask some of its losses.Mr. Viola, part of the new management that came to the bank last year, said Monday that an investigation now under way would produce findings by mid-February, ahead of national elections scheduled for Feb. 24 and 25.With M.P.S. based in Siena, in a part of northern Italy that is a stronghold of the leftist Democratic Party, the conservative former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is trying to be a spoiler in next month’s elections, has been trying to lay blame for the scandal at the Democratic Party’s doorstep. Meanwhile, the current prime minister, Mario Monti, has had to defend his government’s decision to bail out the banks with loans granted last year.More broadly, though, the problems at M.P.S. provide an extreme example of an old-line banking pattern that analysts say is still disturbingly commonplace in Europe. As with most Italian banks, M.P.S.’s primary shareholder is a local foundation, which receives dividends that are to be used to pay for social projects as well as cultural and charitable enterprises. That gives M.P.S. an extensive veil of political relationships that can be hard for any national overseer to peer through.The same combination of local political influence and lax control has also afflicted many banks in Germany and Spain, with taxpayers left suffering the consequences. Indeed, grave lapses by national regulators are among the main reasons European leaders have decided to put the European Central Bank in charge of bank regulation.But now there is a possible snag in the plan: Mr. Draghi, who is expected to lead that overhaul, was at least nominally the overseer of M.P.S. while it was digging itself into a deep hole.Many analysts, though, question whether Mr. Draghi — or any Italian regulators — would have had enough information to recognize the bank’s problems, since there appears to have been a deliberate attempt to conceal losses. And in any case, the Bank of Italy may not have had legal power to prevent M.P.S. from making bad decisions.But at the very least Mr. Draghi’s proximity to the scandal is untimely as the E.C.B. and euro zone leaders finally seemed to be rebuilding credibility in the common currency. The decision to create a centralized banking supervisor at the E.C.B. is a big part of the effort to restore confidence in the euro zone.“Italy is a country where even national regulators can have a trouble getting a grip on what is happening at the local level,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. Mr. Véron stressed that there was no evidence Mr. Draghi deserved any blame for the Monti dei Paschi scandal.But Mr. Véron said, “It clearly does create perception problems, because there’s a question mark about the appropriateness of the Bank of Italy’s response at the time.”“At this point it’s only a question mark,” Mr. Véron said. “We don’t have any facts.”A spokesman for the E.C.B. declined to comment Monday.Several of Germany’s landesbanks, regional institutions typically owned jointly by state governments and local savings banks, have also gotten into serious trouble in recent years and required bailouts which cost taxpayers billions of euros. Like M.P.S., many landesbanks got in over their heads when they tried to respond to the increasing dominance of big investment banks by getting into investment banking themselves.M.P.S.’s problems stem partly from its attempts, starting in the 1990s, to avoid being acquired by larger rivals, said Filippo Ippolito, an assistant professor in finance at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. Mr. Ippolito is from Siena and worked for several years at Monti dei Paschi more than a decade ago.The city foundation that owned a majority of the bank wanted to keep its headquarters in Siena. But attempts by bank management to join the major leagues turned out badly, including an abortive attempt to get into investment banking and, in 2007, the ill-fated €9 billion acquisition of Antonveneta.In retrospect, Mr. Ippolito said, Siena would be much better off if it had allowed M.P.S. to be acquired years ago.“The great fear of the Sienese in the 90s was in losing control of the bank,” Mr. Ippolito said. “Now they are losing control anyway and it’s not worth anything. The worst outcome is coming true.”The scandal may also have implications for two of the largest banks operating in Europe. Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and Nomura, a Japanese bank which has a large presence in London, were involved in transactions that may have allowed Monti dei Paschi to conceal losses.A spokesman for Nomura said the bank would not comment. Deutsche Bank issued a statement Monday saying said the financing transaction with Monti dei Paschi in 2008 “was subject to our rigorous internal approval processes and also received the requisite approvals of the client who was independently advised.”“There will be polemics and rhetoric about evil foreign bankers,” said Federico Fubini, an economics reporter at the Milan daily Corriere della Sera. “But upon closer look, the M.P.S. affair reflects the Italian way of doing things, one that has contributed to the current crisis of competitiveness.”Bank board members appointed by foundations have more political than financial competence, said Tito Boeri, who teaches economics at Bocconi University in Milan, which can lead to bad judgment, like the “crazy idea to buy Antonveneta to maximize power,” he said.Italian newspapers on Monday said that investigators were looking into the possibility that a bribe had been paid as part of the acquisition of Antonveneta, which was bought from the Spanish bank Santander. But Mr. Viola, the M.P.S. chief executive, said Monday that no evidence had emerged that illicit money had passed hands. Should any evidence emerge, he said, the bank would present itself as an injured party in court.Though Mr. Berlusconi, of the People of Liberty Party, and Mr. Monti, who leads a centrist coalition, have not failed to underscore the links between M.P.S. and the Democratic Party, political analysts say it is unlikely that the revelations will have much effect on national elections next month. Opinion polls in the past week tend to support that view.But the murkiness may have thwarted the Democratic Party’s ability to lure fresh voters, said Stefano Folli, a political analyst for economic daily Il Sole 24 Ore, limiting their overall numbers and making it more difficult for the party to control both houses of Parliament.“Right now the Democratic Party hovers between 29 and 32 percent, after Monte dei Paschi, I doubt it will go any higher,” but it will not go any lower either, he said, as long as “no further scandals emerge.” Current polls show that because of the way the Italian parliamentary seats are allotted, the center-left will win the lower house but may not have control of the senate.Mr. Viola said Monday that the political brouhaha over the bank was distorting the issue at stake, “out of line with respect to the problem.Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, the current Bank of Italy governor, Ignazio Visco, said: “M.P.S. is a sound bank. The Bank of Italy does not act as a police force, but promotes sound and prudent management.”Others say that any responsibility, or blame for lapses, should be shared by the Finance Ministry, which oversees banking foundations.New revelations are expected to emerge Tuesday when Italy’s financial stability committee — which includes representatives of the Finance Ministry, the Bank of Italy and other regulars — will meet in Rome to discuss the M.P.S. affair.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/nyregion/congress-gives-final-approval-to-hurricane-sandy-aid.html,"WASHINGTON — Congress gave final approval on Monday to an emergency aid package of nearly $51 billion to help millions of victims of Hurricane Sandy, ending the legislation’s long and complicated odyssey.By a 62-to-36 vote, the Senate approved the measure, with 9 Republicans joining 53 Democrats to support it. The House recently passed the bill, 241 to 180, after initially refusing to act on it amid objections from fiscal conservatives over its size and its impact on the federal deficit.The newly adopted aid package comes on top of nearly $10 billion that Congress approved this month to support the recovery efforts in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states that were battered by the hurricane in late October.The money will provide aid to people whose homes were damaged or destroyed, as well as to business owners who had heavy losses. It will also pay for replenishing shorelines, repairing subway and commuter rail systems, fixing bridges and tunnels, and reimbursing local governments for emergency spending.President Obama praised the vote, saying, “I commend Congress for giving families and businesses the help they deserve, and I will sign this bill into law as soon as it hits my desk.”Leaders from storm-damaged states welcomed the vote in the Senate, though the aid package does not cover the entire $82 billion in damage that the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut identified in aid requests to Washington.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, joined with Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, both Democrats, saying, “Despite the difficult path in getting to this moment, the Senate membership clearly recognized early on the urgency and necessity of approving the full aid package.”“To all Americans,” they added, “we are grateful for their willingness to come to our aid as we take on the monumental task of rebuilding, and we pledge to do the same should our fellow citizens find themselves facing unexpected and harsh devastation.”In the debate leading up to the vote in the Senate, lawmakers from the storm-tossed region faced one major hurdle: an amendment backed by fiscal conservatives that proposed cuts in other programs to pay for the storm aid.Republican supporters of the amendment argued that Congress had to begin imposing fiscal discipline on itself and that the aid package included unrelated spending items, like $274 million for Coast Guard initiatives in the Bahamas and Great Lakes.“At some point, we need to make choices,” Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, told his colleagues. “We can’t have everything. That’s how you get trillion-dollar deficits.”But lawmakers from the region argued that the government had an obligation to respond quickly to the emergency in the Northeast without miring the process in a debate over deficit spending.Supporters of the package also warned that amending the bill would further delay aid from getting to victims by forcing the measure to be considered yet again in the House, where it has already faced fierce resistance.“It’s been 91 days since Sandy struck,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said. “We’ve waited 91 long days. We can’t wait any longer.”In the end, the amendment was defeated, 62 to 35, largely along party lines.The Senate action brings an end to a fierce Congressional debate that had lasted since Dec. 7, when Mr. Obama proposed a $60.4 billion emergency bill to finance recovery efforts.The Democratic-led Senate passed the measure, with minor changes, within a few weeks. But the Senate measure eventually died in the House after Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, adjourned the previous Congress without taking it up.Mr. Boehner eventually agreed to take up the matter this year after coming under intense criticism from leading Republicans in and out of Congress, including Governor Christie."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/middleeast/israeli-secularists-find-their-voice-in-yair-lapid.html,"JERUSALEM — Speaking to a group of ultra-Orthodox men shortly before he officially entered politics, Yair Lapid, a proudly secular talk-show host, declared that in a century-long competition to define Israel’s character, “we lost and you won.”“Not only in terms of numbers,” Mr. Lapid said in late 2011 at a college for religious students, but also in politics “and as a consumer force and in the streets and in the culture and in the educational system — you won in all these places.”Now, Mr. Lapid’s stunning success in last week’s election, in which his new Yesh Atid became Israel’s second largest party, is being viewed by many voters, activists and analysts here as a victory for the secular mainstream in the intensifying identity battle gripping the country.The catchphrase of Mr. Lapid’s populist campaign, and now a core principle of the negotiations to create Israel’s next governing coalition, is “sharing the burden.” That refers directly to lifting the widespread draft exemptions for the ultra-Orthodox, integrating them into the work force, and shifting the balance of who pays taxes and who receives government aid. But it is also code for a broader sociological shift, a call to push back against the ultra-Orthodox minority’s outsize influence in the public sphere, including efforts to gender-segregate buses, sidewalks and stores in their neighborhoods and strict rabbinical controls on marriage, divorce, conversion and adoption statewide.“All of a sudden there was a change in seculars in Israel — they see themselves also as a sector that needs to fight for themselves,” said Mickey Gitzin, director of Be Free Israel, a group founded in 2009 that advocates for equality and religious pluralism. “People say, ‘Wait a minute, I don’t see myself as part of a society where women cannot sit in the front of the bus.’ People don’t want to be part of such an extreme society.”Shmuel Jakobovits, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who runs the Torah Institute of Contemporary Issues in Jerusalem, said he, too, sees the election as about far more than how many yeshiva students should be drafted.“The community is growing, and it’s perceived as a potential threat to the character of the rest of the country,” Rabbi Jakobovits said. “The underlying issue is that there’s an ideological contest over the soul of the state of Israel and the Jewish people.”In a survey of Israeli Jews last summer conducted for another pro-pluralism group, Hiddush, 47 percent identified the religious-secular divide as the most acute in society, more than twice as high as the next ranked choice of politics, at 19 percent, followed by rich and poor, at 15 percent. In a separate Hiddush poll the week before the election, 67 percent said a party’s position on matters of religion and state — including the draft and civil marriage — would influence their vote.“There are elements in the making of a Kulturkampf,” said Uri Regev, a Reform rabbi who runs Hiddush, using the 19th-century German term for culture war. “These issues have a way of coming out and messing up solidarity, messing up politics. It’s time to deal with them in a way that is a root canal; that’s what’s necessary.”The ultra-Orthodox, known here as Haredim, now make up nearly 10 percent of the Jewish population, up from 6 percent a decade ago. But their concentration in some Jerusalem neighborhoods and certain cities around the country — often helped by huge, subsidized housing projects geared to their large families — has led many less-religious Jews to flee from what they call Haredization.Clashes have increased along with the population shift. Buses have stopped running advertisements depicting people because portraits of women were constantly vandalized. Religious soldiers have boycotted military ceremonies where women sing. Those who drive on the Sabbath are sometimes harassed. And in late 2011, an international uproar was set off when a group of Haredi men spit at an 8-year-old Modern Orthodox girl on her way to school, calling her a prostitute because her clothing was seen as not modest enough.“I am so tired of the ultra-Orthodox,” Merav Basher, 39, said to explain her vote for Yesh Atid, Hebrew for There is a Future. “I wanted to make sure to give them as little power as possible.”Ms. Basher lives in Modiin, a city halfway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv where there was a recent flare-up with a neighboring Haredi community over access to public parks. Mr. Lapid received 27 percent of the vote there. He did even better in well-to-do Tel Aviv suburbs like Hod Hasharon, Kfar Shmaryahu and Savion, leading many to describe Yesh Atid as a “white tribe” of upper-class descendants of Eastern European Jews.“If there’s one thing Israelis hate, it’s to be a frier,” said David Tal, 50, a tour guide from Modiin, using a slang Hebrew term for “sucker.” “The Haredim have become an issue which makes people feel like suckers, and Lapid connected to that.”Mr. Lapid, 49, is hardly the first politician to galvanize the secular middle class into a voting bloc. His father, Yosef Lapid, known as Tommy, did so a decade ago with the Shinnui Party. But the elder Mr. Lapid “was much more militant and much more aggressive,” said Benjamin Brown, a professor of Jewish thought at Hebrew University, citing cartoons he thought bordered on anti-Semitic and slogans suggesting Haredim were “the source of all evil in our society.”The younger Mr. Lapid, in contrast, recruited two Orthodox rabbis to his slate for Parliament, and he talks about uniting Israel’s tribes. “Definitely the music is different,” said Professor Brown, who is also a researcher at the Israel Democracy Institute. “Maybe it really reflects a difference in essence. I’m not sure.”The first test will be the issue of the draft. The Supreme Court last spring invalidated a law exempting thousands of yeshiva students from serving, but the government has so far failed to come up with a plan for integrating them.Mr. Lapid, who won 19 of Parliament’s 120 seats and has emerged as a power broker in the negotiations to form a new government, wants to cut the exemptions to a few hundred and impose sanctions on those who do not serve. He also wants to require more math, science and English in Haredi schools.But there is staunch opposition from the ultra-Orthodox, who have been part of nearly every coalition since 1977, gaining leverage as their numbers have grown, to 16 lawmakers in the current government from 10 in 1992. Last week, two Haredi parties, Shas and United Torah Judaism, won 18 seats combined, which their leaders have pointed out is one shy of Mr. Lapid’s showing.“If they try to compel the Haredim,” Meir Porush of United Torah Judaism told the Israeli newspaper Maariv, “then we are heading toward a deep rift.”Beyond the draft, Mr. Lapid’s party platform said it would “work to promote” civil marriage, including for same-sex couples, and “rectify inequality in family laws.” On his Facebook page, Mr. Lapid wrote that “as far as women’s exclusion is concerned there can be no compromise or negotiation.”In the speech to the ultra-Orthodox at Ono Academic College, Mr. Lapid spoke pointedly about overhauling the draft and the core curriculum, but also called for a sort of détente.“I realize you don’t want your kids to play with my kids in the public playground, and I try very hard not to take offense,” he said. “But there’s no reason why we can’t find a way to live next door to each other without my having to fear that you’ll proselytize my kids, and without you having to fear that I’ll corrupt your kids.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/middleeast/iranian-journalists-arrested-accused-of-ties-to-foreign-media.html,"Security forces in Iran have arrested journalists from at least four Iranian newspapers and one news agency over the past few days and accused them of consorting with hostile foreign news media, the state-run press reported Monday. Iranian rights advocates called the arrests part of a broader campaign of intimidation to forestall political unrest before the presidential election in June.The official accounts did not clarify how many journalists had been arrested, the precise nature of the accusations against them or when they might be formally charged. The Committee to Protect Journalists, a media advocacy group based in New York, said at least 11 journalists had been seized, calling the crackdown the largest on Iranian news media since the unrest that swept the country four years ago.Accounts by the Mehr news agency and other official news outlets said many of the journalists had been taken into custody on Sunday after the raids on the outlets, all of which are regarded as reform-minded. One of the newspapers, Etemad, is close to a former president, Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, and had been raided the previous day as well.None of the arrests were reported by the raided organizations themselves. Some Iranian journalists said the omissions appeared to reflect fears of further antagonizing the Revolutionary Guards and affiliated security forces whose loyalties lie with the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.The Mehr news agency said the arrested journalists had been accused of “collaborating with some of the Persian-language foreign media” — apparently an allusion to the Persian services of both the BBC and the Voice of America. The Fars news agency, without citing sources, said the suspects had tried to contact the foreign news media and had sought training on photography and filming with cellphone cameras. “Moreover, they wanted to learn how to assemble the pieces and send them to the BBC,” Fars said.The Iranian Students’ News Agency quoted the culture minister, Mohammad Hosseini, as saying none of the accusations were media related.“We are investigating this issue, and once we have more information, we will inform the media,” he was quoted as saying. “It seems that these individuals have been arrested for security reasons.”But Sherif Mansour, the program coordinator for the Middle East and North Africa for the Committee to Protect Journalists, assailed the raids, saying, “With this wave of arrests, the authorities appear to be attempting to pre-emptively silence independent news coverage ahead of the presidential elections in June.”Hadi Ghaemi, executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran, an advocacy group based in New York, said the arrests came against the backdrop of increased political tensions in Iran over the coming election and Ayatollah Khamenei’s wish to avoid a repeat of the mayhem that followed the disputed 2009 campaign, which reformist candidates said was rigged in favor of the incumbent, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Although the next vote is five months away, Ayatollah Khamenei and his subordinates have been warning that Iran’s domestic and foreign enemies will use the campaign to foment discord in attempts to subvert the Islamist government that has been in power since the 1979 revolution.“There is a lot of nervousness in the regime, including a lot of infighting,” Mr. Ghaemi said. “This is the beginning of an attempt to have a very controlled and quiet election coming up, and not result in any popular outbursts.”News organizations in Iran that are regarded as reformist, he said, “were the easiest to quiet down.”Some political infighting in Iran broke into the open last week with the disputed dismissal of the central bank governor, a move that appeared to precipitate a roughly 10 percent drop in the value of the rial, the national currency, already weakened from what government critics call economic mismanagement and the effects of Western sanctions on Iran.Cliff Kupchan, an Iran analyst at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consulting firm in Washington, said it appeared that Ayatollah Khamenei has become increasingly unsettled by Iran’s acute economic problems because of the possibility of instability. Mr. Kupchan said the ayatollah’s worries may have been reflected in a Jan. 15 statement by the commander of the Revolutionary Guards, Brig. Gen. Nasser Shabani, that economic troubles could cause regional unrest.“Currently, the state of the economy is a national security issue, and it is very likely that Khamenei and his apparatus, the office of the leader, have become directly involved in major economic decisions,” Mr. Kupchan wrote Monday in an advisory to clients."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/americas/ex-dictator-is-ordered-to-trial-in-guatemala-for-war-crimes.html,"MEXICO CITY — A Guatemalan judge on Monday ordered Efraín Rios Montt, the former dictator, and his intelligence chief to stand trial on charges of genocide and crimes against humanity in connection with the massacres of villagers in remote highlands three decades ago.The ruling clears the way for a public trial for Mr. Rios Montt, a former general who ruled Guatemala for 17 months in 1982 and 1983 during the bloodiest period of the country’s long-running civil war. It is a stunning decision for Guatemala, where the military still wields significant power behind the scenes and the country’s elected governments have struggled to build democratic institutions.“The principle function of the state and its officials is to protect its citizens,” said Judge Miguel Angel Gálvez before finding that there was sufficient evidence to try Mr. Rios Montt, 86, and another former general, José Mauricio Rodríguez Sánchez.The two are accused because they had final command over troops that killed 1,771 people in the Mayan-Ixil region as soldiers carried out a scorched-earth campaign to hunt down left-wing guerrillas.In a telephone interview after the judge’s ruling was announced, the prosecutor, Orlando López, said that all the evidence the attorney general’s office had submitted, including the testimony of 140 witnesses and internal military documents from the time, was enough to ensure that a trial would go ahead.“Legally, we were certain,” Mr. López said. “But politically we considered that it would be difficult because of the circumstances, with a former military man in the government.”President Otto Pérez Molina is a former general who has said he does not believe that the killings during the war amounted to genocide.A United Nations truth commission determined that the military had carried out “acts of genocide,” including in the Mayan-Ixil villages during the war, in which 200,000 people died.Mr. Rios Montt’s defense lawyer, Danilo Rodríguez, argued in court last week that his client never signed orders to eliminate the Ixil Indians or identified them as an internal enemy.“After the truth commission, people said it was not enough, this is a compromise, justice is being crippled,” said Almudena Bernabeu, a lawyer with the Center for Justice and Accountability in San Francisco, who has worked with victims’ groups to bring a case under Spain’s universal jurisdiction rule.Cases brought by survivors’ groups against Mr. Rios Montt and the top military leadership had been stalled in the country’s weak judicial system for more than a decade.“For Rios Montt to be tried breaks the wall of impunity,” said Victoria Sanford, an anthropology professor at the City University of New York who has written about Guatemala’s civil war. “It says genocide is genocide and it is punishable by law.”As a legislator until last January, Mr. Rios Montt was protected from prosecution. Prosecutors filed charges when his term expired, but his lawyers’ appeals delayed the case.Scholars of Guatemala said that a number of factors combined to get the case to court, including the tenacity of the attorney general, Claudia Paz y Paz, and successful efforts to appoint more independent judges.Anita Isaacs, a political scientist at Haverford College who studies Guatemala’s attempts to deal with its war crimes, also suggested that the military itself might have changed its stance on Mr. Rios Montt’s case. “There was a hope that if he could be brought to trial, this could be the end of the armed conflict,” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/europe/max-kampelman-who-led-arms-talks-with-soviet-union-dies-at-92.html,"Max Kampelman, an American diplomat enlisted by Democratic and Republican presidents to negotiate cold war treaties with the Soviet Union on nuclear weapons and human rights, died on Friday at his home in Washington. He was 92.The cause was congestive heart failure, his son Jeffrey said.Mr. Kampelman, who was a legislative counsel to Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota in the 1950s, had become a prominent lawyer in Washington when he received a call from another Minnesotan, Vice President Walter F. Mondale, in 1980.President Jimmy Carter wanted Mr. Kampelman to represent the United States at the coming East-West meetings in Madrid, in which the United States was seeking to bring the Soviet Union and some Eastern European countries into compliance with world human rights accords signed in Helsinki, Finland, in 1975.Mr. Kampelman took the job reluctantly and only after being assured it would last just three months. Instead it lasted three years — deep into the first term of President Ronald Reagan, who retained Mr. Kampelman as lead negotiator. When an agreement was announced in July 1983, Mr. Kampelman was careful not to give the Soviets too much credit.“We cannot in good conscience permit a limited negotiating success, important as we believe it to be, to make us forget, much to our regret, that signatures on a document do not necessarily produce compliance with its provisions,” Mr. Kampelman said in Madrid, days after the agreement was announced.His comments, which included recounting a laundry list of past Soviet violations, such as the 1979 invasion in Afghanistan and the 1981 imposition of martial law in Poland, angered Soviet delegates.The toughness and cleareyed patience he displayed in Madrid impressed the Republican administration. Less than two years later — even after Mr. Kampelman had served as an adviser to Mr. Mondale in his 1984 presidential campaign — President Reagan appointed him to lead arms-control talks with the Soviets in Geneva. The president said he had “no more important goal” in his second term than to reduce nuclear weapons.Mr. Kampelman, who had no previous experience negotiating arms control, said of the Soviet Union in advance of meetings in March 1985: “We cannot wish it away. It is here and it is militarily powerful. We share the same globe. We must try to find a formula under which we can live together in dignity. We must engage in that pursuit of peace without illusion but with persistence, regardless of provocation.”Mr. Kampelman returned to his private law practice in 1989, but the negotiations eventually led to the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, reducing nuclear weapons. When Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the last president of the Soviet Union, toured the United States as a private citizen in May 1992, his schedule included a meeting with Mr. Kampelman.Mr. Kampelman also served as chairman of WETA, the public television station in Washington, and was a founder and moderator of “Washington Week in Review” (now “Washington Week”) on PBS.Max M. Kampelman was born on Nov. 7, 1920, in New York City. (He had no middle name, only an initial.) His parents, Jewish immigrants from Romania, lived in the Bronx and sent him to Jewish schools. Mr. Kampelman graduated from New York University in 1940 and enrolled in law school in the university’s night program soon afterward, working to support himself during the day.Mr. Kampelman opposed Communism as a young man, but he also opposed war, and he requested conscientious objector status during World War II. He was eventually sent to the University of Minnesota, where he was one of 36 volunteers who served in an experiment to study the effects of severe weight loss through what essentially was controlled starvation.Even as Mr. Kampelman’s weight fell to 100 pounds, he continued to study toward his law degree at N.Y.U., which he received in 1945. He later received master’s and doctoral degrees in political science from the University of Minnesota.Mr. Kampelman began working as a Humphrey aide when he was mayor of Minneapolis in the 1940s and later joined his Senate staff. His political views underwent a transformation along the way: he went from being a declared pacifist to a centrist regarded as a hawk by left-leaning Democrats.“The development of atomic and hydrogen bombs led me to doubt my earlier faith in the power of nonviolence to overcome evil in international relations,” he said in an interview.He left Mr. Humphrey’s staff in 1955 — the two remained close friends, and Mr. Kampelman worked on Humphrey’s failed presidential campaigns in 1968 and 1972 — and spent much of the next quarter-century in private law practice.In addition to his son, he is survived by two daughters, Julia Stevenson and Sarah Kampelman, and five grandchildren. His wife, the former Marjorie Buetow, died in 2007; the couple were married for 58 years. A son, David, died in 2004, and a daughter, Anne Wiederkehr, died in 2006."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/opinion/violence-against-women-act-is-reintroduced.html,"Turning to a critical piece of unfinished business, Patrick Leahy, the Democratic chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, joined last week with a Republican colleague, Michael Crapo of Idaho, to reintroduce legislation to reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act, the 1994 law central to the nation’s efforts to fight domestic violence, sexual assault and stalking.Their bill cleared the Senate last April in a 68-to-31 vote, but it was blocked in the Republican-led House largely over provisions that would expand protections against abuse for gay and immigrant victims.The reintroduced Senate bill would provide services, like shelters and legal help, for victims of abuse regardless of their sexual orientation or immigration status. But it omits the original bill’s modest increase in the number of special visas, known as U-visas, available to undocumented immigrants who are victims of domestic violence and sexual assaults.House Republicans opposed any increase in that number and sought to end the current ability of U-visa holders to apply for permanent residency after three years, a move that would have eliminated an important incentive for frightened victims to contact law enforcement and assist in prosecutions. (They also noted that there was a procedural problem with having a U-visa fee in the original Senate bill.) The new bill also incorporates steps to reduce the inexcusable national backlog of untested rape kits. These changes might make it easier to push this legislation through the House.In the meantime, the Senate needs to take up the bill as soon as possible before its schedule and attention is fully focused on other big legislative priorities, like gun violence, immigration reform and debt reduction.There is no need for another set of hearings or another Judiciary Committee vote. The Senate’s majority leader, Harry Reid, should use the window before Congress breaks for its Presidents’ Day recess in February to secure Senate passage of the latest version of the Leahy-Crapo bill. That move would help put pressure on Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders in the House to stop playing ideological games and reach agreement with the Senate on extending this lifesaving law."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/dispute-with-antigua-and-barbuda-threatens-us-copyrights.html,"WASHINGTON — A long-simmering trade conflict between the United States and Antigua and Barbuda appears to be boiling over.Antigua and Barbuda, which has a $1 billion economy, is planning on getting legal retribution from the United States’ $15 trillion economy over its refusal to let Americans gamble at online sites based in the Caribbean nation — perhaps by offering downloads of American intellectual property, like Hollywood films, network television shows or hit pop songs. On Monday, the World Trade Organization gave its go-ahead for Antigua and Barbuda’s tentative plan.“The economy of Antigua and Barbuda has been devastated by the United States government’s long campaign to prevent American consumers from gambling,” Harold Lovell, Antigua’s finance minister, said in a statement. “These aggressive efforts to shut down the remote gaming industry in Antigua have resulted in the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and seizure by the Americans of billions of dollars belonging to gaming operators and their customers.”The conflict’s roots are a decade old. The World Trade Organization said that the United States had violated its trade agreements by preventing Americans from betting at sites based in Antigua and Barbuda. Because Washington is unwilling to make the betting legal, the countries have been locked in a dispute over what constitutes fair trade practices and fair compensation.The online gambling industry was at one point the second-largest employer in the Caribbean country, its government has said, and economists estimated its worth at $3.4 billion. Gambling employment has dropped to fewer than 500 people from more than 4,000 as a result of the United States’ trade policy, it said.On Monday, a dispute settlement body in Geneva gave Antigua and Barbuda the nod to, in essence, violate American intellectual property rights to make up its losses, calculated at $21 million a year.It remains murky just how the Antigua and Barbuda government might go about it. But trade watchers suggested it might set up a site where viewers could pay a pittance to watch a film or television show with an American copyright. The United States might not be able to shut the site down under international law.“We are disappointed with Antigua and Barbuda’s decision to abandon constructive settlement discussions,” Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, said in an e-mail. “As recently as Friday, our two countries held high-level discussions on possible settlement options that would have brought real benefits to Antigua’s businesses and people.”The Obama administration said that the proposed plan might further hurt trade relations between the two countries.“If Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft of intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua’s own interests,” Ms. Harmon said. “Government-authorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major impediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries.”Trade experts said that Antigua and Barbuda’s plan for retribution seemed designed to provoke American filmmakers and recording artists into pushing for Congress to allow foreign Internet gambling sites to serve American customers.They also noted that it was the United States that had pushed for the unusual “cross-retaliation” mechanism at the W.T.O., where trade violations that hurt one industry could be countered with trade actions against a completely different industry.“The irony is rich, rich, rich,” said Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group.“The practical question is, Is there a majority in the House and Senate to vote to revoke the ban, and would Congress do it because the W.T.O. told them?” she said, saying it was unclear how the two countries would proceed."

Ryan, that President Obama is “not looking to moderate, that he’s not looking to move to the middle.”It is the Republicans who have failed to acknowledge that their extreme positions are out of sync with the American people and who need to moderate their views, not the Democratic Party. Republicans show a fundamental misunderstanding of the political center by repeatedly claiming that everything the president proposes is too far to the left.Republicans have a tough road ahead of them if they intend to show how their ideas, which promote the interests of the rich, are, in Mr. Ryan’s words, “better at solving the problems that arise in people’s daily lives.”JAY N.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/opinion/a-better-immigration-plan-from-president-obama.html,"President Obama hit the right notes when he made the case for overhauling the immigration system in a speech in Las Vegas on Tuesday. He spoke one day after a bipartisan group of eight senators released their own blueprint for a comprehensive reform bill, and the back-to-back events gave the odd sensation — rare during the Obama administration — of seeing Congress and the White House moving in more or less the same direction.“Now is the time,” Mr. Obama said, noting that Washington was having a bipartisan moment on immigration not seen since George W. Bush was president and Senator Edward Kennedy was leading the push for reform. The president restated the familiar and still-sound principles behind an immigration overhaul: a more secure border and workplace; legalization for 11 million undocumented immigrants; and a modernized system of legal immigration that eliminates backlogs, reunites families and has enough visas for valued workers and entrepreneurs. He also gave a helpful reminder that it’s wrong to cast immigration as a battle of “them” and “us.” A false distinction, he said, because most of us used to be “them.”The fiercest point of debate and the biggest obstacle to a bill, of course, is whether and how to get “them” — that is, 11 million undocumented immigrants — out of the shadows, free to live and work here legally and to become citizens if they wish. “It should be clear at the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship,” Mr. Obama said, stressing the “is.” An objectionable part of the senators’ blueprint is that it refuses to put undocumented immigrants on a path to permanent residency and citizenship until a host of border-enforcement actions is completed first.Given existing immigration backlogs and the possibility of other administrative hurdles being placed in the way, any future path to citizenship could be so long and burdensome as to be all but imaginary. Mr. Obama, to his credit, made the citizenship path a central part of his plan and did not make it contingent on adding still more troops, border fencing and aerial drones.Mr. Obama released his own list of immigration-reform principles separately on Tuesday, and it is far better than the plan put forward by the senators. Besides the forceful language on citizenship, it offers ways to end backlogs in family-sponsored immigration, urges more staffing and improvements in immigration courts and added protections for immigrants who assert their labor rights. It also declares that members of same-sex couples should have the same opportunities to sponsor their partners for visas that others do.Mr. Obama noted in his speech that the coming debate will be heated, and he warned of “folks trying to pull this thing apart,” as immigration reform opponents have reliably done in the past. The Senate Judiciary Committee will be holding hearings next month, and then the battle will begin in earnest.Mr. Obama said on Tuesday that if Congress gets bogged down, he will be ready to offer his own bill and “insist that they vote on it right away.” We hope that won’t be necessary and that Congress gets the message, adopts the best of his stated principles and keeps the process moving, on the rails, in the right direction."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/politics/give-up-pay-many-lawmakers-would-feel-little-pain.html,"WASHINGTON — In principle, it sounds self-sacrificing, even noble: Congress swears off collecting its paychecks until it passes a budget.But behind the “no budget, no pay” proposal, which the House passed last week when it voted to temporarily extend the debt limit, is also a basic reality: many of those who support the concept are so wealthy that their Congressional paychecks represent little more than a rounding error.Take Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who led the charge on the measure in the House. He has a net worth between $3.8 million and $9.7 million, according to an analysis of his most recent financial disclosure by the Center for Responsive Politics.That is not exactly a fortune befitting a Rockefeller or a Kennedy, but it is more than enough to cushion any discomfort he might feel from missing a few paydays. Many of the other lawmakers who have championed “no budget, no pay,” both Republicans and Democrats, are similarly wealthy.Congress, for all its democratic trappings, has long been richer than a typical collection of 535 Americans. But the gap between the financial standing of members and the population as a whole appears to have grown in recent decades, analysts of financial disclosure forms say.As many ordinary Americans have struggled to get by in recent years, members of Congress were largely insulated from the economic downturn, based on their net worth. The median net worth of American households is $66,740, while for the 535 members of Congress it is about $966,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Congressional lawmakers earn at least $174,000 a year.The Democratic co-sponsor of the “no budget, no pay” bill in the Senate, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, is worth between $3.6 million and $11.7 million, according to the center’s tallies. The other Senate co-sponsor, Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, is worth less but is still doing just fine, with a net worth of between $2.8 million and $3.4 million. The Senate may pass the measure as early as Wednesday.When the debt limit extension passed the House last week, the chamber’s three wealthiest members voted yes:  Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas (net worth estimated at $500 million, from Clear Channel Communications, founded by his wife’s family); Darrell Issa, Republican of California ($480 million, from Viper car alarms); and Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado ($215 million, from the greeting card Web site Blue Mountain).Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, also pushed for the provision. His estimated net worth is as high as $52 million, and he returns 15 percent of his Congressional paycheck each year.“One thing I’ve never called for is an outright reduction in salary, because I do appreciate that members come from different walks of life,” Mr. Rigell said. But as imperfect a solution as withholding pay might be, he said the concept was sound. “I am convinced that is a big enough lever to influence the institution,” he said, “and it needs it.”Since 1974, Congress has been required to pass a nonbinding annual budget. But the Senate has failed to pass a budget in the past three years, in part because Democratic leaders did not want to subject embattled members to tough spending votes.As moneyed as Congress is these days, some members would feel the pinch if they stopped receiving their paychecks. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has a reported net worth of no higher than $300,000, making him one of the few nonmillionaires to support the bill. That also makes him the fifth-poorest member of the Senate, according to the figures from the Center for Responsive Politics.In the House, more than a few members have an estimated net worth that is a negative figure, meaning their financial liabilities are greater than their assets.Disagreements about the provision’s effectiveness aside, some have raised questions about whether it is constitutional.The debt limit extension bill says that if either chamber of Congress fails to approve a budget resolution for the next fiscal year by April 15, members’ paychecks are to be held in an escrow account until a measure passes — or, if that never happens, until the end of the 113th Congress in early 2015.Opponents have argued that this may run afoul of the 27th Amendment, which says lawmakers cannot vary their compensation in a single Congress.“It’s clearly unconstitutional, and we shouldn’t do unconstitutional things,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who noted almost as a point of pride that he was one of the House’s poorest members.But Mr. Nadler said he had other issues with the plan as well, including that he felt it was coercive and could force members to vote for legislation they thought was flawed.And he said he was concerned about the precedent it would set. “If you want only millionaires to be in Congress,” he said, “this is a good idea.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/politics/senate-panel-approves-kerry-for-secretary-of-state.html,"WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Senator John Kerry as secretary of state on Tuesday, filling a key position on President Obama’s retooled national security team.The nomination was approved by a vote of 94 to 3. Only three senators, all Republicans, opposed the nomination: Ted Cruz and John Cornyn of Texas, and James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma. Mr. Kerry voted present.Mr. Obama’s first choice for the job, Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew as a candidate after Republicans criticized her for comments she made after last September’s deadly attack on the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya.Mr. Kerry, a Massachusetts Democrat who has served in the Senate since 1985, had strong support on both sides of the aisle. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee, the panel he has led for the last four years, gave his nomination unanimous approval hours before the Senate vote.In a statement, Mr. Obama took note of Mr. Kerry’s bipartisan support. “John has earned the respect of leaders around the world and the confidence of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate, and I am confident he will make an extraordinary secretary of state,” the president said.Mr. Kerry, who is a Vietnam veteran, a former presidential nominee and the son of a diplomat, will be inheriting a difficult agenda. The conflict in Syria has killed more than 60,000 people. The international envoy on the Syrian crisis, Lakhdar Brahimi, who reported to the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday, has made no headway. Egypt is in turmoil. By Mr. Kerry’s own account, relations with Russia have deteriorated.As chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee during Mr. Obama’s first term, Mr. Kerry was a loyal ally of the White House and served as an interlocutor with President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, among others.During a nearly four-hour confirmation hearing last week, Mr. Kerry demonstrated familiarity with a broad range of issues, but he did not present any new ideas on how to address them.Hillary Rodham Clinton, whose last day as secretary of state is Friday, said at a global forum at the Newseum on Tuesday that she expected Mr. Kerry to undertake a new effort to narrow differences between Israel and the Palestinians.Taking note of the recent Israeli parliamentary elections, in which a centrist coalition made significant gains, Mrs. Clinton said that the shifting political landscape might facilitate progress.“I actually think that this election opens doors, not nails them shut,” she said. “I know that President Obama, my successor, soon to be Secretary of State John Kerry, will pursue this.”Mr. Kerry, 69, suggested in his confirmation hearing last week that he would try to make headway in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, though he provided no specifics as to how.“I have a lot of thoughts about that challenge,” he said. “We need to try to find a way forward, and I happen to believe that there is a way forward.”Mr. Obama has also named former Senator Chuck Hagel, Republican of Nebraska, to succeed Leon E. Panetta as secretary of defense, and John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s chief counterterrorism adviser, as director of the Central Intelligence Agency, permanently succeeding David H. Petraeus, who resigned in November.Mr. Hagel and Mr. Brennan will surely face more questions than Mr. Kerry did from senators of both parties when their confirmation hearings are held, though their nominations are expected to be approved.Mr. Hagel’s hearing is scheduled for Thursday, and Mr. Brennan’s for Feb. 7.No date has been set for Mr. Kerry’s resignation from the Senate. The governor of Massachusetts, Deval Patrick, a Democrat, will make an interim appointment to succeed Mr. Kerry until a special election can be held."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/perry-changes-tack-on-rainy-day-fund.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — For years, Gov. Rick Perry has urged Texas lawmakers to resist the temptation to tap the billions of dollars in a state emergency account known as the Rainy Day Fund.Generated largely by taxes on oil and gas production, the fund has been a frequent source of political turbulence, as Democrats have sought to use it for public education and other services while Republicans have resisted, arguing that it was meant to cover emergencies and not recurring expenses. In January 2001, in his first State of the State speech at the Capitol here, Mr. Perry told legislators that the fund was an insurance policy against an economic downturn, adding that “we should keep our hands off of it while our economic picture remains uncertain.”Twelve years later, in his seventh biennial State of the State address, Mr. Perry returned to the Capitol on Tuesday with a very different message, telling lawmakers that the time had come to draw $3.7 billion from the fund for a one-time investment in water and transportation infrastructure. The fund has a balance of about $8.1 billion but continues to grow.“We need to maintain a strong Rainy Day Fund,” Mr. Perry told the lawmakers and political figures assembled in the House chamber. “While we cannot — and we will not — raid that fund to meet ongoing expenses, we also shouldn’t accumulate billions more than is necessary.”Mr. Perry’s call to use the Rainy Day money has yet again turned the fund into a lightning rod for partisan politics. Several Republican lawmakers and leaders had already proposed using the fund for water and transportation, while Democrats and education advocates said the governor and other conservatives were favoring such projects over crucial services that they said had been decimated by Republican cutbacks.The governor and other Republicans do not view their shift on the fund as backpedaling. They said a record-breaking drought had created a sense of urgency to find a way to finance the state’s 50-year water plan, which calls for spending $53 billion on reservoirs and other projects. And they said that vastly different circumstances were at play. In the last legislative session, in 2011, Democrats wanted to tap the fund to offset cuts to public education as the state was facing a budget shortfall. Now, the state has a budget surplus as Republicans seek to make the one-time water investment.“The Rainy Day Fund was created to ensure we had a sufficient amount in reserve in case of disaster and to maintain Texas’ strong credit rating,” Mr. Perry said. “And due to our economic success, this fund will soon have $12 billion in it, significantly more than the amount we need to meet those obligations.”In Texas, financing public education, in particular, is more politically charged than paying for new roads and reservoirs. Democrats have argued that the state — bolstered by the Rainy Day Fund and a surplus of $8.8 billion — has ample resources to restore some or all of the $5.4 billion in cuts made to public education in the 2011 session. Republicans, who control the Legislature, have vowed not to undo the cuts.“What I heard was a lot about investing in infrastructure, roads, water, but not nearly enough about investing in our people,” said State Representative Gene Wu, a Democrat from Houston. “Our teachers are still some of the lowest-paid teachers anywhere in this great nation, and we’re asking more of them. We’re asking them to work harder, asking them to be more accountable, but we’re not paying them any more.”Mr. Perry’s speech was a kind of testament to his vision of Texas exceptionalism. The governor said the state remained a national destination for employers and job seekers, pointing to the nearly 1.4 million private-sector jobs that have been created in the state over the past 10 years. “Texas is not merely strong, but exceptional,” he said.Such talk struck some as more bombast than reality. State Representative Naomi R. Gonzalez, a Democrat from El Paso, said she was not sure what parallel universe Mr. Perry was living in, adding that her constituents’ concerns about how to make ends meet went unmentioned by the governor.Mr. Perry used the speech to promote the initiatives he wants the Legislature to support, including tax relief of at least $1.8 billion. His remarks were interrupted as activists with the Texas Organizing Project, a group that advocates for low-income people, stood and shouted for an expansion of Medicaid while he was discussing the tax plan. On the chamber floor, it was nearly impossible to hear them — Republican lawmakers rose from their seats and applauded, drowning out the protesters as they were rushed out by state troopers.“I didn’t know there would be that much excitement about tax relief,” Mr. Perry said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/world/asia/outgoing-south-korean-leader-creates-furor-with-pardons.html,"SEOUL, South Korea — With less than one month left in office, the departing president of South Korea, Lee Myung-bak, granted special pardons on Tuesday to political allies, a longtime friend and dozens of others who have been convicted of corruption and other crimes. The pardons ignited a rare quarrel between him and the president-elect.The office of the incoming president, Park Geun-hye, had warned Mr. Lee for days not to “abuse his presidential power” by granting pardons in his last days in office that would “go against the will of the people.”Mr. Lee ignored that appeal. “This is not an abuse of presidential authority,” Mr. Lee was quoted by his office as saying during a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. “It is carried out according to law and procedure.” His office said Mr. Lee noted that far fewer people had been granted presidential clemency during his five years in office than under his predecessors.The highly unusual dispute between Mr. Lee and Ms. Park, who are members of the governing Saenuri Party, rekindled a long-running controversy in South Korea over the president’s clemency power. Presidents typically issue pardons several times during their terms, often just before national holidays, and hundreds or thousands of people at a time may be freed from prison or have restored civil rights that were revoked by a criminal conviction, like the right to run for political office. But the beneficiaries have often been prominent politicians, big businessmen and close associates of the president. Civic groups and others complain that such pardons help foster persistent corruption among the country’s political and business elite by allowing the well connected to escape justice.On the campaign trail, candidates for president often warn that people convicted of corruption should not expect a pardon. But once elected, they invariably announce a special amnesty near the end of the single five-year term they are allowed under the Constitution.Mr. Lee, whose term ends Feb. 25, continued that pattern with special pardons for 55 people on Tuesday, including Chun Shin-il, a businessman and longtime friend, and Choi See-joong, a close ally and former cabinet member. Both were convicted of bribery and have served less than half of their prison terms.The pardons also erased the criminal records of two allies of Mr. Lee who were convicted of bribery but avoided prison terms: Park Hee-tae, a former National Assembly speaker, and Kim Hyo-jae, a former senior aide.Ms. Park’s spokesman, Yoon Chang-jung, assailed the step. “Pushing ahead with pardoning those involved in irregularities and corruption will receive a national reproach,” Mr. Yoon said on Tuesday. “President Lee should bear all responsibility.”The Democratic United Party, the main opposition group, raised suspicions that Ms. Park’s criticism of Mr. Lee was insincere and meant to shield her from any public anger over the pardons. In fact, a close ally of Ms. Park was among those pardoned on Tuesday.“We are appalled by the brazen arrogance, self-righteousness and lack of communication that President Lee is demonstrating until his last day in office,” the party’s spokesman, Jung Sung-ho, said in a statement. “President-elect Park Geun-hye should be held responsible, too, for doing nothing to stop the pardons except uttering a few words of criticism.”Ms. Park’s transition team was thrown into disarray on Tuesday when her choice for prime minister withdrew his name because of reports raising suspicions that he and his family accumulated a fortune through real-estate speculation. The nominee, Kim Yong-joon, also headed the transition team."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/politics/gop-pulls-back-on-immigration-not-on-guns.html,"WASHINGTON — As Congress and the White House prepare to refight two epic policy battles from the past — a new agenda to stem gun violence and another to address the nation’s  heavily criticized immigration system — political, demographic and economic shifts  are propelling  immigration changes  forward as forcefully as they are pulling lawmakers away on guns.Bruised by successive presidential defeats in which Hispanic voters played  a significant role, Republicans are eager to join in producing legislation that would make it easier for people to immigrate to the United States or stay here in some cases if they entered illegally. The cause has been helped by years of a sputtering economy, which has reduced the flow of illegal immigrants, and thus the red hot anger directed at them, as well as increased border security.But while Republicans are drawing back from their outspoken stance on immigration, as well as opposition to gay marriage and other social issues, they have found gun rights a secure policy to defend, often with the help of Democrats from conservative states, and are almost certain to oppose any agenda beyond changes to background checks for gun owners.The dynamic in Washington mirrors the sentiment back home for many lawmakers. “We are getting closer to a balanced approach,” said Chad Connelly, chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party, about immigration.  “We got spanked in November, and I think what Republicans are looking for is something that enforces border security while making it easier to come here.”Changes to gun laws, he said, have no such support. “They will have a rough row to hoe,” he said. “I have some donors who own gun stores who said they can’t keep stuff in the store.”One of the most significant changes between 1994, when the omnibus crime bill instituting an assault weapons ban passed, and now, is the number of competitive House seats; there were more than 160 back then, now there are fewer than 100.This means that Republicans in politically mixed districts who feel the pressure to vote for new gun control measures “are fewer and farther between than there have ever been,” said David Wasserman of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. Democrats in Republican districts — there are about a dozen of them — would also be disinclined toward such legislation.Further, there are Senate Democrats up for re-election in 2014 who are loath to get behind the president’s broad gun agenda, which includes a renewal of the assault weapons ban, a restriction on size of ammunition magazines and new background checks. “I am a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights,” said Senator Mary L. Landrieu, Democrat of Louisiana, who said she is hearing both sides of the issue back home. “Over all, the state is probably more supportive of less restrictions than more.”Tellingly, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, said on Monday that he was “committed to ensuring that the Senate will consider legislation that addresses gun violence and other aspects of violence in our society early this year,” but added that when it came to President Obama’s immigration agenda, he would “work tirelessly to make reform a reality in the Senate.”In 1994, a group of House Republicans banded together to support a broad crime act that included an assault weapons ban. Part of the bill included tough crime measures that appealed to some of them, but it was still an enormous lift; in the end 46 Republicans supported the measure while 131 opposed it.“I jumped off the cliff with Jon Kyl, who was running for the Senate that year,” said former Representative Jim Kolbe of Arizona, referring to his colleague, the former conservative House member and senator from Arizona. The two flew to Tucson, where they faced angry voters at a public meeting, Mr. Kolbe said.“We explained why we did it, why we thought it was a reasonable trade but a lot of people were very unhappy,” Mr. Kolbe said. He noted that the National Rifle Association remained supportive — an unlikely outcome today.On the flip side, Republicans, who were deeply divided just two years ago on immigration issues now largely believe their party needs to be behind some legislation. Senator John McCain of Arizona, who made tough border enforcement the cornerstone of his 2010 re-election campaign, stood with Democrats this week to nearly reverse his position once again on the issue, saying he would seek a bipartisan plan.“Necessity is the mother of political invention,” said Bill Whalen, a fellow at the Hoover Institution. “Republicans are looking at a third straight presidential defeat if they don’t improve their image with Hispanic voters.” He added, “You don’t have a lot of Republicans walking around town saying he lost an election because of our bad relationship with the gun control lobby.”A gun bill that is limited to background checks, however, still remains a strong possibility in Congress this year, if the Republican leadership of the House would bring such a measure on the floor. “I was a co-sponsor of a conceal carry bill in Nebraska that had a significant background check component,” said Senator Deb Fischer, a newly elected Republican from Nebraska.Such a measure, many gun experts say, may actually do the most to stem gun violence, because it would help keep weapons out of the hands of the mentally ill and criminals. “We might be in a happy place where effectiveness conforms with political feasibility,” said Jon S. Vernick, the co-director of Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/politics/full-transcript-of-president-obamas-remarks-on-immigration-reform.html,"The following is the complete transcript of President Obama’s remarks on immigration on Tuesday in Las Vegas. (Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service.)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you. Thank you so much. Thank you. (Cheers, applause.) Thank you.Well, it is good to be back in Las Vegas. (Cheers, applause.) And it is good to be among so many good friends. Let -- let me start off by thanking everybody at Del Sol High School for hosting us. (Cheers, applause.) Go, Dragons! Let me especially thank your outstanding principal, Lisa Primas. (Cheers, applause.)There are all kinds of notable guests here, but I just want to mention a few. First of all, our outstanding secretary of Department of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano is here. (Cheers, applause.) Our wonderful secretary of the interior, Ken Salazar. (Cheers, applause.) Former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis. (Cheers, applause.) Two of the outstanding members of the congressional delegation from Nevada, Steve Horsford and Dina Titus. (Cheers, applause.) Your own mayor, Carolyn Goodman. (Cheers, applause.)But we also have some mayors that flew in because they know how important the issue we’re going to talk about today is, Marie Lopez Rogers from Avondale, Arizona -- (cheers, applause) -- Kasim Reed from Atlanta, Georgia -- (cheers, applause) -- Greg Stanton from Phoenix, Arizona (cheers, applause) -- and Ashley Swearengin from Fresno, California.(Cheers, applause.)And all of you are here -- (cheers) -- as well as some of the top labor leaders in the country, and we are just so grateful. Some outstanding business leaders are here as well. And of course we got wonderful students here. (Sustained cheers, applause.) So I could not be prouder of our students.Now, those of you who have a seat, feel free to take a seat. I don’t mind. (Laughter.)AUDIENCE MEMBER: I love you, (Obama ?)!PRESIDENT OBAMA: I love you back! (Cheers.)Now, last week -- last week I had the honor of being sworn in for a second term as president of the United States. (Cheers, applause.) And during my inaugural address, I talked about how making progress on the defining challenges of our time doesn’t require us to settle every debate or ignore every difference that we may have. But it does require us to find common ground and move forward in common purpose. It requires us to act.And I know that some issues will be harder to lift than others. Some debates will be more contentious. That’s to be expected.But the reason I came here today is because of a challenge where the differences are dwindling, where a broad consensus is emerging and where a call for action can now be heard coming from all across America.I’m here today because the time has come for common-sense, comprehensive immigration reform -- (cheers, applause) -- (inaudible). Now’s the time. Now’s the time. (Cheers, applause.) Now’s the time. (Chanting.) Now’s the time.I’m here because -- I’m here because most Americans agree that it’s time to fix a system that’s been broken for way too long.AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Right!PRESIDENT OBAMA: I’m here because business leaders, faith leaders, labor leaders, law enforcement and leaders from both parties are coming together to say now is the time to find a better way to welcome the striving, hopeful immigrants who still see America as the land of opportunity. Now’s the time to do this so we can strengthen our economy and strengthen our country’s future.Think about it. We define ourselves as a nation of immigrants. That’s who we are, in our bones. The promise we see in those who come here from every corner of the globe, that’s always been one of our greatest strengths. It keeps our workforce young, it keeps our country on the cutting edge, and it’s helped build the greatest economic engine the world has ever known.After all, immigrants helped start businesses like Google and Yahoo. They created entire new industries that in turn created new jobs and new prosperity for our citizens.In recent years 1 in 4 high-tech startups in America were founded by immigrants. One in 4 new small-business owners were immigrants, including right here in Nevada, folks who came here seeking opportunity and now want to share that opportunity with other Americans.But we all know that today we have an immigration system that’s out of date and badly broken; a system that’s holding us back instead of helping us grow our economy and strengthen our middle class.Right now we have 11 million undocumented immigrants in America, 11 million men and women from all over the world who live their lives in the shadows. Yes, they broke the rules. They crossed the border illegally. Maybe they overstayed their visas. Those are the facts. Nobody disputes them.But these 11 million men and women are now here. Many of them have been here for years. And the overwhelming majority of these individuals aren’t looking for any trouble. They’re contributing members of the community. They’re looking out for their families. They’re looking out for their neighbors. They’re woven into the fabric of our lives.Every day, like the rest of us, they go out and try to earn a living. Often they do that in the shadow economy, a place where employers may offer them less than the minimum wage or make them work overtime without extra pay. And when that happens, it’s not just bad for them, it’s bad for the entire economy, because all the businesses that are trying to do the right thing, that are hiring people legally, paying a decent wage, following the rules -- they’re the ones who suffer.They’ve got to compete against companies that are breaking the rules. And the wages and working conditions of American workers are threatened too.So if we’re truly committed to strengthening our middle class and providing more ladders of opportunity to those who are willing to work hard to make it in the middle class, we’ve got to fix the system. We have to make sure that every business and every worker in America is playing by the same set of rules. We have to bring this shadow economy into the light so that everybody is held accountable, businesses for who they hire and immigrants for getting on the right side of the law. That’s common sense, and that’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.And -- (cheers, applause) -- now, there’s another economic reason why we need reform. It’s not just about the folks who come here illegally and have the effect they have on our economy; it’s also about the folks who try to come here legally but have a hard time doing so and the effect that has on our economy. Right now there are brilliant students from all over the world sitting in classrooms at our top universities. They’re earning degrees in the fields of the future, like engineering and computer science. But once they finish school, once they earn that diploma, there’s a good chance they’ll have to leave our country.Now, think about that. Intel was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Instagram was started with the help of an immigrant who studied here and then stayed here. Right now in one of those classrooms, there’s a student wrestling with how to turn their big idea, their Intel or Instagram, into a big business.We’re giving them all the skills they need to figure that out, but then we’re going to turn around and tell them to start that business and create those jobs in China or India or Mexico or someplace else. That’s not how you grow new industries in America. That’s how you give new industries to our competitors. That’s why we need comprehensive immigration reform.Now -- (cheers, applause) -- now, during my first term, we took steps to try and patch up some of the worst cracks in the system. First, we strengthened security at the borders so that we could finally stem the tide of illegal immigrants. We put more boots on the ground on the southern border than at any time in our history. And today, illegal crossings are down nearly 80 percent from their peak in 2000. (Applause.)Second, we focused our enforcement efforts on criminals who are here illegally and who endanger our communities. And today, deportations of criminals -- (applause) -- is at its highest level ever.And third, we took up the cause of the dreamers, the young people who were brought to this country as children -- (cheers, applause) -- young people who have grown up here, built their lives here, have futures here. We said that if you’re able to meet some basic criteria, like pursuing an education, then we’ll consider offering you the chance to come out of the shadows so that you can live here and work here legally, so that you can finally have the dignity of knowing you belong.But because this change isn’t permanent, we need Congress to act, and not just on the DREAM Act.We need Congress to act on a comprehensive approach that finally deals with the 11 million undocumented immigrants who are in the country right now. That’s what we need. (Cheers, applause.)Now, the good news is that for the first time in many years Republicans and Democrats seem ready to tackle this problem together. (Cheers, applause.) Members of both parties in both chambers are actively working on a solution. Yesterday a bipartisan group of senators announced their principles for comprehensive immigration reform, which are very much in line with the principles I’ve proposed and campaigned on for the last few years. So at this moment it looks like there’s a genuine desire to get this done soon. And that’s very encouraging.But this time action must follow. We can’t allow -- (applause) -- immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate. We’ve been debating this a very long time. So it’s not as if we don’t know technically what needs to get done.As a consequence, to help move this process along, today I’m laying out my ideas for immigration reform. And my hope is that this provides some key markers to members of Congress as they craft a bill, because the ideas that I’m proposing have traditionally been supported by both Democrats like Ted Kennedy and Republicans like President George W. Bush. You don’t get that matchup very often. (Laughter.) So -- so we know where the consensus should be.Now of course, there will be rigorous debate about many of the details. And every stakeholder should engage in real give and take in the process. But it’s important for us to recognize that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place. And if Congress is unable to move forward in a timely fashion, I will send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.AUDIENCE MEMBERS: Yes! (Cheers, applause.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: So -- so the principles are pretty straightforward. There are a lot of details behind it. We’re going to hand out a bunch of paper so everybody will know exactly what we’re talking about. But the principles are pretty straightforward.First, I believe we need to stay focused on enforcement. That means continuing to strengthen security at our borders.It means cracking down more forcefully on businesses that knowingly hire undocumented workers. To be fair, most businesses want to do the right thing, but a lot of them have a hard time figuring out who’s here legally, who’s not. So we need to implement a national system that allows businesses to quickly and accurately verify someone’s employment status. And if they still knowingly hire undocumented workers, then we need to ramp up the penalties.Second, we have to deal with the 11 million individuals who are here illegally. Now, we all agree that these men and women should have to earn their way to citizenship. But for comprehensive immigration reform to work, it must be clear from the outset that there is a pathway to citizenship. (Cheers, applause.)We’ve got to -- we’ve got to lay out a path, a process that includes passing a background check, paying taxes, paying a penalty, learning English, and then going to the back of the line behind all the folks who are trying to come here legally, that’s only fair. (Cheers, applause.) All right? So that means it won’t be a quick process, but it will be a fair process and it will lift these individuals out of the shadows and give them a chance to earn their way to green card and, eventually, to citizenship. (Cheers, applause.)And the third principle is we’ve got to bring our legal immigration system into the 21st century because it no longer reflects the realities of our time. (Cheers, applause.) For example, if you are a citizen, you shouldn’t have to wait years before your family is able to join you in America. (Cheers, applause.) You shouldn’t have to wait years.If you’re a foreign student who wants to pursue a career in science or technology or a foreign entrepreneur who wants to start a business with the backing of American investors, we should help you do that here because if you succeed you’ll create American businesses and American jobs, You’ll help us grow our economy, you’ll help us strengthen our middle class.So that’s what comprehensive immigration reform looks like -- smarter enforcement, a pathway to earn citizenship, improvements in the legal immigration system so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and the brightest all around the world.It’s pretty straightforward.The question now is simple. Do we have the resolve as a people, as a country, as a government to finally put this issue behind us? I believe that we do. (Applause.) I believe that we do. I believe we are finally at a moment where comprehensive immigration reform is within our grasp. But I promise you this. The closer we get, the more emotional this debate is going to become.Immigration’s always been an issue that inflames passions. That’s not surprising. You know, there are few things that are more important to us as a society than who gets to come here and call our country home, who gets the privilege of becoming a citizen of the Untied States of America. That’s a big deal. When we talk about that in the abstract, it’s easy sometimes for the discussion to take on a feeling of us versus them. And when that happens, a lot of folks forget that most of us used to be them. (Cheers, applause.) We forget that.And it’s really important for us to remember our history. You know, unless you’re one of the first Americans, a Native American, you came from someplace else. (Cheers, applause.) Somebody brought you.You know, Ken Salazar -- he’s of, you know, Mexican-American descent, but he -- he points out that his family’s been living where -- where he lives for 400 years.(Cheers.) So he didn’t -- he didn’t immigrate anywhere. (Laughter.)The Irish, who left behind a land of famine; the Germans, who fled persecution; the Scandinavians, who arrived eager to pioneer out west; the Polish; the Russians; the Italians; the Chinese; the Japanese; the West Indians; the huddled masses who came through Ellis Island on one coast and Angel Island on the other -- (cheers, applause) -- you know, all those folks, before they were us, they were them. (Laughter.)And when each new wave of immigrants arrived, they faced resistance from those who were already here. They faced hardship. They faced racism. They faced ridicule. But over time, as they went about their daily lives, as they earned a living, as they raised a family, as they built a community, as their kids went to school here, they did their part to build the nation. They were the Einsteins and the Carnegies, but they were also the millions of women and men whose names history may not remember but whose actions helped make us who we are, who built this country hand by hand, brick by brick. (Cheers, applause.)They all came here knowing that what makes somebody an American is not just blood or birth but allegiance to our founding principles and the faith in the idea that anyone from anywhere can write the next great chapter of our story.And that’s still true today. Just ask Alan Aleman. Alan’s here this afternoon. Where’s Alan? He -- he -- he’s around here. There he is right here. (Cheers, applause.) Now, Alan was born in Mexico. (Cheers, applause.) He was brought to this country by his parents when he was a child. Growing up, Alan went to an American school, pledged allegiance to the American flag, felt American in every way. And he was, except for one -- on paper. In high school, Alan watched his friends come of age, driving around town with their new licenses, earning some extra cash from their summer jobs at the mall. He knew he couldn’t do those things. But it didn’t matter that much; what mattered to Alan was earning an education so that he could live up to his God-given potential.Last year, when Alan heard the news that we were going to offer a chance for folks like him to emerge from the shadows, even if it’s just for two years at a time, he was one of the first to sign up. And a few months ago he was one -- one of the first people in Nevada to get approved. (Cheers, applause.) In that moment Alan said, I felt the fear vanish. I felt accepted.So today Alan’s in his second year at the College of Southern Nevada. (Cheers, applause.) Alan’s studying to become a doctor. (Cheers, applause.) He hopes to join the Air Force. (Cheers, applause.) He’s working hard every single day to build a better life for himself and his family. And all he wants is the opportunity to do his part to build a better America. (Applause.)So -- so in the coming weeks, as the idea of reform becomes more real and the debate becomes more heated and there are folks who are trying to pull this thing apart, remember Alan and all those who share the same hopes and the same dreams. Remember that this is not just a debate about policy. It’s about people. It’s about men and women and young people who want nothing more than the chance to earn their way into the American story.And throughout our history, that’s only made our nation stronger. And it’s how we will make sure that this century is the same as the last, an American century, welcoming of everybody who aspires to do something more, who’s willing to work hard to do it, and is willing to pledge that allegiance to our flag.Thank you. God bless you. And God bless the United States of America. (Cheers, applause.)Copyright © 2013 by Federal News Service, LLC, 1120 G Street NW, Suite 990, Washington, DC 20005-3801 USA.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/nyregion/solicitations-by-aide-to-john-c-liu-will-be-focus-in-fraud-case.html,"A senior aide to John C. Liu, the New York City comptroller, solicited campaign donations on his behalf from friends and family members and offered to reimburse them, according to statements by a lawyer and a prosecutor on Tuesday in Federal District Court in Manhattan.The aide, Sharon Lee, who once served as press secretary for the comptroller’s office, is expected to testify for the government under an order of immunity at the trial next week of Mr. Liu’s former campaign treasurer, Jia Hou, a federal prosecutor said in court.Ms. Hou and a co-defendant, Xing Wu Pan, a former fund-raiser, have been charged with conspiring to defraud the city by using so-called straw donors on behalf of Mr. Liu’s campaign. In such a scheme, people contribute to a candidate with money reimbursed by others.In the case of Ms. Lee’s solicitations, only one person, her mother, made a donation, and she was not reimbursed, according to a letter to the judge from Ms. Hou’s lawyer.Ms. Lee, who still works for the comptroller’s office in a research and liaison role, has not been charged with a crime. Her lawyer, Andrew M. Lankler, declined to comment.She has been one of Mr. Liu’s most trusted aides, and is a longtime loyalist from the days when he was an ambitious city councilman from Flushing, Queens. For many years, she was his primary spokeswoman, on the Council and at the outset of his tenure as comptroller. She remains a constant presence at his government and campaign events, enjoying the kind of access that few aides can claim.The prosecutor, Justin Anderson, said nothing in court to indicate Mr. Liu had been aware of Ms. Lee’s actions on his behalf. Mr. Liu’s campaign finances have been under federal investigation for several years. He has denied wrongdoing; his lawyer, Paul Shechtman, declined to comment.Mr. Anderson, responding to questions from Judge Richard J. Sullivan, said Ms. Lee had solicited the donations from family members and friends around the same time that Ms. Hou was soliciting a straw donation. Mr. Anderson said Ms. Lee was not expected to testify that she had been instructed to make such solicitations, but because she and Ms. Hou had both performed senior roles for the comptroller, a jury could “infer that their actions were coordinated.”Sheryl E. Reich, one of Ms. Hou’s lawyers, said in a letter to the judge that government materials made available to the defense show that only one person made a donation in response to Ms. Lee’s requests — her mother — and that she was never reimbursed.Ms. Reich said the materials also show that Ms. Lee, whom she called a campaign volunteer, never told Ms. Hou “of either the solicitations or, specifically, the offer to reimburse her mother.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/politics/obama-in-speech-leaves-room-for-a-tough-fallback.html,"In laying out his proposal for an immigration overhaul in a speech in Las Vegas on Tuesday, President Obama offered both carrots and sticks to persuade lawmakers in Congress to pass the ambitious legislation this year.Speaking before an energized and sometimes jubilant crowd of supporters at Del Sol High School, Mr. Obama offered his broad principles for an immigration bill. They included a pathway to citizenship for 11 million illegal immigrants in the country, enhanced enforcement at borders and in workplaces, and changes to make legal immigration more efficient, especially for foreigners with advanced skills, investors and family members of immigrants already here.Mr. Obama described his principles as “key markers” for Congress as it debates the volatile issue, but in his speech and in a more detailed fact sheet the White House distributed, many of the most potentially divisive points of contention were left vague.As the president noted, his principles sounded remarkably like the blueprint released Monday in Washington by a bipartisan group of eight senators, led by Charles E. Schumer of New York, a Democrat, and John McCain of Arizona, a Republican, which called for a “tough but fair” path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, tougher border security, and more enforcement to prevent unauthorized foreigners from taking jobs.But at this early stage in the negotiations, critical differences between Mr. Obama and the still small group of Republicans who were willing to participate in the bipartisan senators’ blueprint — including Mr. McCain and Jeff Flake of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida — lurk in the fine print.So the president left open recourse to a tougher position. “It’s important for us to recognize,” Mr. Obama said, “that the foundation for bipartisan action is already in place.” If Congress gets bogged down in “endless debate,” he said, he would send his own bill to Capitol Hill and insist on a quick vote.Mr. Obama used his speech to give himself dual options: being involved in the debate as it unfolds in coming months in Congress, while also staying distant enough to be able to force the action in the direction of policies he favors, if he finds it necessary.While he is negotiating with lawmakers working to forge a bill that can win Republican votes, Mr. Obama must also manage the scrutiny and soaring expectations of Latino and immigrant groups, labor and religious leaders as well as business and farm organizations, all of which are much better prepared to mobilize for comprehensive legislation than they were in 2007, when a previous effort at an overhaul failed.Those groups were present in force on Tuesday, most of them invited to Las Vegas by the White House. The choice of the Nevada city was a nod to the fast-growing Latino population that provided crucial votes for the re-election in 2010 of Harry Reid, the Senate majority leader, and of Mr. Obama last year.There was something for all of the groups in Mr. Obama’s speech. Appealing to Hispanics and young illegal immigrants who call themselves Dreamers, he spoke at length about one of them, Alan Aleman, a Mexican-born youth from Nevada who received a deportation reprieve under a program Mr. Obama started last June. Appealing to labor, he framed his proposals as an effort to create fair rules for the middle class. Appealing to business, he promised legal improvements “so that we continue to be a magnet for the best and brightest all around the world.”A swell of praise came from many of those groups after the speech.Richard Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said Mr. Obama had showed “tremendous determination” to get comprehensive legislation passed this year. Mr. Trumka said the labor movement was unified behind that effort and would wage a full-scale campaign this year to support it.Hector E. Sanchez, the chairman of the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda, a coalition of 30 of the country’s largest Hispanic groups, called the meeting “a beautiful celebration.” But he said Latinos would be demonstrating in the streets and watching the debate closely. “For us, the priority is citizenship,” he said. “We don’t want a path that is extremely long and painful. Our community has already suffered enough.”Probably the biggest fight that is looming between the White House and skeptical Republicans is over how long and how direct that pathway will be for illegal immigrants. Republicans were quick to point out that the president made no mention of a central piece of the senators’ blueprint: measures to increase security at borders and in workplaces that would have to be in place before any illegal immigrants could be put on a course leading to citizenship.Mr. Rubio said that without such triggers in place, enforcement might fail and “we will be back in just a few years dealing with millions of new undocumented people in our country.”Other Republicans were even more doubtful. “This administration has a poor record of enforcing our immigration laws already on the books,” said Representative Robert W. Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee. He said Americans would have “a lot of questions about how this would work.”Despite the urgency from Mr. Obama and supporters of the overhaul, Mr. Rubio said Republicans would not be rushed. “The president’s speech left the impression that he believes reforming immigration quickly is more important than reforming immigration right,” Mr. Rubio said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/gunman-opens-fire-at-phoenix-office-complex.html,"PHOENIX — A gunman opened fire at an office complex here on Wednesday, killing one man and injuring two others before speeding away, the police said. Three other people were hospitalized for stress brought on by the shooting.A police spokesman identified the gunman as Arthur Harmon, 70.The gunman opened fire just outside the lobby of the office complex after a mediation session at a law firm in the building over a lawsuit he had filed against a call center based in Scottsdale, Ariz., the authorities said. The call center’s chief executive, Steven Singer, 48, who was at the session, was killed.The shooting took place around 10:30 a.m. in the lobby of a three-story commercial building on North 16th Street, in the heart of the city. The police spokesman, Sgt. Tommy Thompson, said it was “not random.” The gunman “came here for a reason,” he said from the scene.Among the injured was Mark Hummels, a lawyer at Osborne Maledon, who was representing Mr. Singer, according to a statement released by the firm. He was shot in the neck and lower back and remained in serious condition after surgery at John C. Lincoln Hospital, the statement said.A woman in her 30s was being treated at the hospital for gunshot wounds that did not appear to be life-threatening, the police said.Some witnesses told the police that they saw an “older white man” talking to two people before he opened fire. Others heard gunfire from inside their offices and hid under their desks.Don Jacksa, a software engineer who works in the building, said he and his co-workers “locked the doors and waited.” Jeremiah Barnes, a driver for a rehabilitation clinic, said he was on his way out to lunch when he spotted a white car driving erratically in reverse out of the parking lot, barely missing incoming cars.A middle school near the scene of the shooting was placed on lockdown as SWAT teams scoured the office complex, looking for the gunman.In the afternoon, officers entered Mr. Harmon’s home, some eight miles north of the office complex, but emerged several minutes later, empty-handed. As of early Wednesday evening, he remained at large. Sergeant Thompson said he should be considered “armed and dangerous.”One neighbor said Mr. Harmon was a retired salesman, reserved yet friendly to those he knew. Another neighbor said he liked to sit in his front yard, drinking beer, and to work on his car."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/nyregion/shirley-l-huntley-ex-state-senator-pleads-guilty-in-fraud.html,"A former state senator pleaded guilty on Wednesday to funneling over $87,000 in taxpayer money through a nonprofit agency that she was running to cover shopping for herself and her relatives.At her appearance in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, the former senator, Shirley L. Huntley, a Democrat who had represented Queens and had fiercely denied any wrongdoing, softly recounted her crimes to a courtroom filled with family members and other supporters.Judge Jack B. Weinstein addressed her in disappointment: “I’m sorry to see you here.”“I’m sorry to be here,” Ms. Huntley responded.Ms. Huntley, 74, had claimed the agency she founded, Parents Information Network Inc., was focused on giving parents more of a voice in their local schools. Instead, prosecutors said, she siphoned the money she received as “member items,” or grants for legislators to support social causes, from the State Education Department. For a three-year period beginning in 2005, Ms. Huntley wrote more than $21,000 in checks to herself from the agency’s account, made more than $34,000 in A.T.M. withdrawals and wrote almost $25,000 in checks to others who later returned the money to her in cash, according to court records.As part of her plea agreement, Ms. Huntley will pay the state the full amount she stole, $87,700. She faces up to two years in prison under the federal sentencing guidelines for the charge, conspiracy to commit mail fraud. A sentencing date has not been set.Ms. Huntley still faces state corruption charges in connection with a scheme to steal from a related nonprofit agency she founded, Parents Workshop Inc. She is expected to plead guilty to one felony charge of tampering with evidence, said a person with knowledge of the case who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was continuing.Ms. Huntley was a state senator for nearly six years until she lost a re-election bid in the 2012 Democratic primary. She joins a long line of former New York State senators recently indicted or convicted of a felony."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/politics/internet-and-federal-act-ease-overseas-us-voting.html,"WASHINGTON — Voting from abroad continued to become easier in last year’s U.S. election, thanks to the combined effects of federal law and Internet resources, according to a new study by the Overseas Vote Foundation, a nonpartisan voter-assistance group.Whereas a full half of expatriate American voters surveyed by the group after the 2008 election reported not receiving a ballot or receiving it too late, that figure declined to one-third for the 2010 election and to just one-fifth in last year’s presidential election.“The tipping point is in the use of technology,” said Claire M. Smith, research manager for the foundation. “There’s no going back.”She said that more than 80 percent of survey respondents had used the Internet last year to help register or request a ballot form and that for the first time in five election cycles, more than half received a blank ballot electronically (via e-mail attachment, fax or Internet download).The foundation surveyed more than 13,500 voters in 160 countries. Most of the names came from the foundation’s mailing list, so the findings cannot be considered scientific. But Ms. Smith said that by several standards — country of residence, state of origin, education level and economic status — they closely mirrored what is known about the American expatriate population.Ms. Smith said the Military and Overseas Voter Empowerment Act of 2009, passed in response to complaints by overseas civilian and military voters about a frustrating system, “does appear to have had a positive impact: More people are getting ballots on time, and they were able to submit ballots earlier.”The act requires that states provide ballots at least 45 days before an election, or obtain a waiver if they are unable to comply. “The vast majority of election officials were able to get their ballots out on time,” Ms. Smith said.More user-friendly election Web sites — operated by private groups like the Overseas Vote Foundation, or by governmental entities — have helped, too.The use of technology, however, has brought its own problems. Both voters and election officials sometimes received electronic files that would not open, arrived corrupted or refused to print.“Obviously, it’s a learning process and there’s a learning curve,” said Ms. Smith.She also said service members overseas faced sometimes daunting obstacles in voting.“A transport to Afghanistan crashed carrying ballots,” she said. “Many soldiers overseas requested e-mail ballots, but they would get caught in spam filters or could not get through military security settings on their e-mail.”A persistent hurdle, Ms. Smith said, is lack of awareness of election deadlines and resources. For example, most states now offer Web sites where individuals can check their registration status. But only 28 percent of those surveyed used such tools in 2012. And many do not know they can print out and use a Federal Write-in Absentee Ballot if a requested ballot fails to arrive in time.The foundation is urging election officials to offer more-energetic outreach to ensure that voters understand how the process is meant to work."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/politics/on-immigration-obama-acts-as-if-he-has-the-upper-hand.html,"WASHINGTON — As the specifics of immigration legislation take shape on Capitol Hill, President Obama is making it clear that he wants the overhaul on his terms.Officials in the West Wing are convinced that the politics of the immigration issue have firmly shifted in their direction. That belief is fueling the president’s push for quick action and broad changes that go beyond what Republicans are signaling would be acceptable if they are to back legislation that allows a path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants.The administration’s confidence — which was communicated to immigration advocates in a series of conference calls and meetings last week — is rooted in the sense among the president’s political advisers that Republicans are eager to embrace broad immigration changes as a way of improving their electoral appeal among Hispanic voters.“We’re giving them some space,” said Dan Pfeiffer, a senior adviser to the president. But in the meantime, he said, “we’re going to continue to make the case to the country about why immigration reform should be done and to put pressure on Republicans that they need to do it.”While aides say Mr. Obama is open to some negotiation over the contours of the immigration changes he laid out Tuesday in Las Vegas, senior administration officials are convinced that there is little risk in pushing hard for Mr. Obama’s immigration priorities, betting that Republicans will think twice about voting down a bill championed by a president who is highly popular among the very voters they covet.The principles Mr. Obama embraced this week differ in some central ways from the effort under way in the Senate, where Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, and six other senators are working toward a bill that could be debated and voted on as early as this summer.Mr. Rubio and the other senators have said illegal immigrants would not be given a pathway to citizenship until the government had taken certain measures — so far unspecified — to secure the border. The White House fears that could become a source of endless delays for immigrants eager to become citizens. The Senate outline also includes a guest worker program for low-income workers, something Mr. Obama and his allies have been concerned about in the past.In legislative fights over health care and stimulus spending in his first term, the president and his team earned scorn from their own supporters for being too willing to compromise. Liberal activists who helped Mr. Obama get elected in 2008 criticized him for trading away a public insurance option to secure passage of the Affordable Care Act.But immigration advocates and White House officials say the dynamic is different now. With his re-election secured and the Republican electoral problems obvious, the president is more likely to stand his ground, they say.“They know that the political momentum is on their side,” said an immigrant advocate whose group participated in conference calls with White House officials last week. “They are pretty confident that they have a broad cross section of civil society behind him on this.”Asked whether White House officials seemed willing to compromise with Republicans to ensure passage, the advocate said, “That is not the message we heard at all.”Mr. Obama, in an interview Wednesday with the Spanish-language network Univision, rejected Mr. Rubio’s criticism that he was not paying enough attention to border security.“We have done more on border security in the last four years than we have done in the previous 20,” the president said. “We’ve actually done almost everything that Republicans asked to be done several years ago as a precondition to move forward on comprehensive immigration reform.”The president’s aides said he would welcome legislation that met his principles but that could also earn broad, bipartisan support in the Senate. They believe that a vote of 80 or more senators from both parties would put more pressure on Republican lawmakers who control the House. But the White House is also willing to fight for a more partisan immigration measure if need be, advisers said. Already there is evidence that Mr. Obama may end up with a messy political fight in spite of the show of bipartisan spirit on display in the Senate this week.In a statement, Mr. Rubio said he was “concerned” by Mr. Obama’s unwillingness to require border security enhancement before illegal immigrants are eligible for citizenship. Mr. Rubio told Rush Limbaugh, the conservative radio host, that the president could “either decide he wants to be part of a solution, or he can decide that he wants to be part of a political issue.”Other Republicans were more scathing about any effort to provide citizenship to illegal immigrants. Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, on Wednesday called Mr. Rubio “amazingly naïve” and “nuts” for believing that Mr. Obama would ever enforce the border.“It didn’t happen under Reagan, but it’s going to happen under President Obama?” Mr. Vitter said in an interview on Laura Ingraham’s radio program.In his speech in Las Vegas, Mr. Obama made it clear what he would do if the senators failed to produce legislation that could pass the Senate and the House. If that happens, he promised to “send up a bill based on my proposal and insist that they vote on it right away.”But in the meantime, aides said Mr. Obama would insist that any final legislation met his goals. White House officials describe Tuesday’s speech in Las Vegas as the opening act in a sustained campaign.Speaking to another Spanish-language network, Telemundo, Mr. Obama said Wednesday that he hoped to see legislation pass by the end of the year, if not in the first six months.One area of potential disagreement is likely to be the speed and certainty with which illegal immigrants can apply for and earn citizenship. Mr. Rubio is pushing for legislation that would deny green cards or citizenship applications until an independent board certifies that the government has secured the border.One senior administration official played down the differences between Mr. Obama’s proposals and those of the bipartisan group.“At the end of the day,” the official said, “we think we know how to get this done in a way that’s fair.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/politics/boston-lawyer-chosen-for-kerrys-senate-seat.html,"BOSTON — Gov. Deval Patrick on Wednesday appointed William Cowan, a Boston lawyer who is a longtime friend and former aide, to serve as an interim United States senator until voters chose a successor to John Kerry in a special election set for June 25.Mr. Cowan, 43, who is known as Mo, is a former partner in the politically connected law firm of Mintz Levin and will become Massachusetts’ first black senator since Edward Brooke, a Republican, held the seat from 1966 to 1978. His appointment makes Mr. Cowan the second black member to be seated in the current Senate, after Tim Scott of South Carolina was appointed by Gov. Nikki R. Haley.Mr. Patrick had said he wanted to appoint someone who did not want to run for the seat later because that person would have to conduct a campaign while learning the ropes in the Senate, and would be unlikely to do either job well. At a packed news conference at the State House, Mr. Cowan said he would not seek the permanent office or use the appointment as a springboard later. “This is going to be a very short political career,” he vowed.The clock is now ticking toward the special election. It promises to be another bruising campaign, with two Democratic congressmen likely to face off in a primary in April.The biggest question remaining in this drawn-out episode, which began last fall when Mr. Kerry’s name surfaced as a possible successor to Hillary Rodham Clinton as secretary of state, is whether former Senator Scott P. Brown, a Republican, will jump in.Mr. Brown has remained mum on the subject, and his camp has sent few signals about his intentions, but he may find the opportunity hard to resist.Polls show him beating Representative Edward J. Markey, the only Democrat who has officially declared his candidacy. Mr. Brown has high name recognition and money left over from his unsuccessful race last year against Elizabeth Warren.If he entered the race and won, Mr. Brown would be in the awkward position of becoming the junior senator to Ms. Warren, even though she has been in office only a few weeks. The Senate historian said that those who return to the Senate after leaving — like Dan Coats of Indiana and Frank R. Lautenberg of New Jersey, for example — lose their seniority, although the distinction has little meaning beyond a way to refer to a state’s senators in the formal oratory of the Senate floor.Still, it would be unusual for a state to have two senators who had run against each other, especially in a race that was particularly hard fought.The June 25 special election would be Mr. Brown’s third statewide Senate race in three years, starting with his win in a special election in January 2010 to finish Senator Edward M. Kennedy’s term. If he won, he would presumably run in 2014 for a full six-year term — or four statewide races in nearly five years.So far, the only Democrat in the race is Mr. Markey, 66, a liberal and dean of the state’s Congressional delegation. Several Democrats, including Mr. Kerry, have closed ranks behind him in the hopes of discouraging anyone else from getting in and avoiding a bruising primary.But Representative Stephen F. Lynch, a conservative Democrat from South Boston, is expected to announce Thursday that he will challenge Mr. Markey. The primary would be held on April 30.The rough and tumble of the coming campaign seemed far away at Wednesday’s news conference, which was attended by Mr. Cowan’s wife, Stacey, and their two young sons.“He’s cool,” Lt. Gov. Timothy Murray said of Mr. Cowan. “Tom Brady, George Clooney, James Bond and the president have nothing on Mo.”Mr. Cowan, who usually wears a bow tie but opted not to for this occasion, is a former chief of staff and chief legal counsel to Mr. Patrick, the state’s first black governor. From 1997 to 2009, he practiced civil litigation as an associate and later a partner in the Boston office of Mintz, Levin, Cohn, Ferris, Glovsky & Popeo. He also served as a special assistant district attorney in Middlesex County. He left the Patrick administration last year to return to the private sector, but said this brief detour to Washington was a sacrifice worth making because he wanted to give something back to the state that had given him so much.Mr. Cowan said at the news conference that he was proud to take the post, noting that his mother, who was home in North Carolina recovering from knee surgery, was a child of the segregated South and had not attended college. The death of Mr. Cowan’s father at a young age left her to raise her children alone.Despite her hardships, he said, “My mother told me that days like this were possible.”He seemed to be a quick study in the senatorial art of not answering questions definitively. Asked, for example, if he would vote for military cuts if they cost jobs in Massachusetts, he called for “a balanced approach,” with some cuts and some revenue growth.Mr. Patrick showed similar deftness, skirting a question about why he had not picked former Representative Barney Frank, who had asserted that he would have loved the interim appointment.Mr. Cowan said that he would be relying on Mr. Kerry’s staff in Washington and in Massachusetts for guidance and that he intended to continue Mr. Kerry’s work. “There won’t be any daylight there at all,” he said.Mr. Patrick, who has served as a mentor to Mr. Cowan, was asked whether he saw some of himself in Mr. Cowan.“I’m not that cool,” the governor replied."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/opinion/as-the-senate-debates-gun-control.html," To the Editor:Justin Cronin’s love letter to responsible gun ownership (“Confessions of a Liberal Gun Owner,” Op-Ed, Jan. 28) doesn’t change this liberal’s position one iota. I, too, grew up in the Northeast, where I learned to handle firearms for target and skeet shooting as a teenager in summer camp. The Army trained me to assemble and fire a military rifle and .45-caliber pistol responsibly. I know the satisfaction of competently handling and firing a deadly weapon.Yet when I picture that dark movie theater in Aurora, Colo., and what might have happened had one or more legally armed people attempted to return that shooter’s fire, I cannot endorse a society in which even responsible, licensed citizens among us routinely carry firearms.Even highly trained, experienced police officers are challenged to make split-second, potentially deadly decisions when confronted with real-world shooters mixed in with civilians. It’s only a matter of time before some innocents end up getting shot by a would-be vigilante. And please explain just how the police are expected to correctly determine which shooter is the perpetrator?The pro-gun folks are right: Responsible gun ownership is legal and generally no more threatening to others than driving a car. Nevertheless, people do get drunk or high on drugs, fight with their partners or co-workers, or get depressed and suicidal. Every day, people do stupid things with their cars and their guns, sometimes injuring or killing others.Our shamefully high incidence of gun deaths is clear evidence that we don’t take this responsibility seriously enough. Gun ownership should require mandatory training, licensing, insurance and annual registration.DEAN FOXFoster City, Calif., Jan. 28, 2013To the Editor:After a month of hysterical hand-wringing, it is a relief to see a rational discussion of gun ownership, self-defense and social meltdown.Compared with most of the world, the United States has been spared huge social upheaval caused by war or natural disaster. But when our luck finally runs out and society falls apart, self-defense will be central to individual survival, and all the current feel-good moralizing will seem fatally naïve. Helplessness is neither admirable nor moral.LAURENCE FRANKHillsborough, Calif., Jan. 28, 2013To the Editor:The most striking fact of Justin Cronin’s confession is the event that led him to purchase his first firearm. It was when nothing happened to him.Yes, evacuation during Hurricane Rita must have been fraught with fear, anxiety, confusion, tension. But where was the violence? In the writer’s imagination, in hindsight. He succumbed to the fear that something “could have” happened, even though nothing did.The gun debate orbits around the fear of boogeymen, minorities, strangers. How ironic that most legal gun owners neither live in the most dangerous American cities nor have they been victims of crime. Only when Americans stop being afraid will we make any true progress.SHAHRYAR MOTIABrooklyn, Jan. 28, 2013To the Editor:So let’s get this straight. In their pious Jan. 30 Op-Ed essay, “Bipartisan Hunting Buddies,” James A. Baker III and John D. Dingell say that one way to curb gun violence is for parents to yank their kids away from their video games and take them out to kill something small and defenseless? They also call for “common sense” in making gun laws. There seems to be a disconnect here.TERRY SHAMESBerkeley, Calif., Jan. 30, 2013To the Editor:Re “Selling a New Generation on Guns” (“Bearing Arms” series, front page, Jan. 27):It comes as no surprise that the gun industry, like Big Tobacco at one time, deliberately targets children in order to groom a new generation of consumers.As the reporting makes abundantly clear, the National Rifle Association and the National Shooting Sports Foundation are trade organizations whose only mission is to increase sales. Behind their meretricious arguments that firearm use somehow develops “life skills” or teaches responsibility is the real bottom line: profits.PATRICK WALSHPrinceton, N.J., Jan. 27, 2013The writer is a former infantry officer.To the Editor: Re “What We Don’t Know Is Killing Us” (editorial, Jan. 27):That the gun lobby has effectively shut down government-financed research on gun violence for 17 years exposes just how shaky its self-confidence is. Many of us are willing to accept gun ownership in exchange for sane public safety measures based on objective data. So if guns ultimately make us safer in and out of our homes, then why not give researchers a chance to prove it? Until the gun lobby is willing to face facts, it will be running scared, and with good reason.ANDREW SOFERJamaica Plain, Mass., Jan. 28, 2013To the Editor:The Jan. 29 column by Joe Nocera, “And in Last Week’s Gun News...,” was brilliant. Listing both accidental and purposeful shootings day by day plainly reveals the depth and ordinariness of our gun culture.Anger and the wish to kill will always be part of human life, but we do not have to make it so easy and commonplace to destroy the lives of neighbors, strangers and family members, instantaneously.It is the gun culture that needs to be killed. And that will not be easy. The time to do it is now, while we still have the capacity to be appalled.BOBBIE GOTTSCHALKCo-founder, Seeds of PeaceWashington, Jan. 29, 2013"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/nyregion/fbi-raids-offices-of-doctor-tied-to-menendez.html,"The Federal Bureau of Investigation on Tuesday raided the offices of a prominent South Florida eye surgeon who is a wealthy Democratic Party donor with close ties to Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.Agents remained all day Wednesday at Vitreo-Retinal Consultants Eye Center, the West Palm Beach offices of the doctor, Salomon Melgen. They also searched several other offices that the doctor has in the area, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. Dr. Melgen, 58, owns over a dozen Florida-registered companies.At the West Palm Beach office, agents from the F.B.I. were joined by the Office of the Inspector General of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, which investigates fraud in Medicare, Medicaid and other agency programs.At midmorning, investigators carried in a crowbar, and a locksmith arrived shortly after noon. A few hours later, they hauled away more than 30 cardboard boxes and placed them into the back of an unmarked van and into a white vehicle.Other than acknowledging that the F.B.I. was “conducting law enforcement activity” there, the agency declined to comment.“The government has not informed Dr. Melgen what its concerns are,” Lawrence Duffy, a lawyer for Dr. Melgen, said in a statement. “However, we are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times.”Records show Dr. Melgen, who is best known for his association with Democratic politicians, including Senator Menendez, owes the Internal Revenue Service more than $10 million.The raid came just four days after a conservative Web site alleged that the F.B.I. was looking into accusations that Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen frequented under-age prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.The site included videos from alleged prostitutes and e-mail exchanges between an F.B.I. agent and a source in the Dominican Republic, who first referred the case to a nonprofit group in Washington.In a statement, the senator called the allegations involving prostitutes “false” and “manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog.” The senator’s office said Wednesday night that Mr. Menendez had reimbursed Dr. Melgen $58,500 for two flights that he had taken aboard his private jet in 2010.The senator also called Dr. Melgen “a friend and political supporter.”Dr. Melgen told The New York Times last week, “I can assure you that all of the allegations are false.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/politics/senate-hearing-to-focus-on-gun-violence.html,"WASHINGTON — The universe of potential changes to federal gun laws seemed to shrink Wednesday during an occasionally tense Senate hearing on gun violence as lawmakers and proponents of more gun rules tussled with gun rights advocates over the availability of some types of weapons and ammunition. In the end, chances for a ban on assault weapons dimmed, and compromise seemed elusive.The hearing, the first held by the Senate Judiciary Committee since the mass shooting last month at a Newtown, Conn., school, began on a poignant note as former Representative Gabrielle Giffords, who was critically injured in a 2011 shooting, addressed the committee slowly but with passion, essentially begging panel members to come up with legislation to address gun violence.“Too many children are dying,” she said to a packed, hushed hearing room. “Too many children.”After Ms. Giffords’s brief testimony, the four-hour hearing quickly devolved into a litany of competing statistics and chilling anecdotes, laying bare the deep national divide between those who believe gun availability contributes to the nation’s most violent crimes and those who think it helps prevent them.Wayne LaPierre, the chief executive of the National Rifle Association, spoke ruefully of the many years he has spent trotting to Capitol Hill to testify about gun violence, and grew irritated under the questions of friend (Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, a vocal supporter of gun rights) and foe (Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, where an honor student in Chicago was fatally shot hours before the hearing).Mr. LaPierre said he did not support the measure that appeared to be gaining the most support among both parties — enhanced background checks for gun buyers — raising the prospect that perhaps even modest changes to gun laws would be hard to accomplish. “Universal background check, which sounds, whatever,” he said, “ends up being a universal federal nightmare imposed upon law-abiding people all over this country.Mr. LaPierre’s strong defense of existing gun laws, which he argued were poorly enforced, and his occasional pique were a contrast with Ms. Giffords’s husband, Mark Kelly, a gun-owning former Navy captain and a retired astronaut, who quietly pulled, bit by bit, at the arguments against stronger background checks, which he and Ms. Giffords seek.“I’ve been shot at dozens of times,” Mr. Kelly said. “I would suspect that not many members of this panel, or even in this room, for that matter, have been in any kind of a firefight. It is — it is chaos. I think there are really some very effective things we can do. And one is, Senator, the background check. Let’s make it difficult for the criminals, the terrorists, and the mentally ill to get a gun.”The greatest area of disagreement centered around the availability of so-called assault weapons, which some Democratic senators seek to ban, and restrictions of large-size magazines, which several Republican senators and their witnesses argued would endanger potential victims of crime and infringe on the rights of law-abiding Americans.Ms. Giffords, who made her way through the hearing room slowly, passing by several senators to bid them hello and give them a kiss, sat next to her husband and slowly began her remarks.“This is an important conversation for our children, for our communities,” Ms. Giffords said. “For Democrats and Republicans. Speaking is difficult, but I need to say something important. Violence is a big problem,” she continued. “We must do something. It will be hard. But the time is now,” she said, emphasizing the last word. “You must act. Be bold. Be courageous. Americans are counting on you.”With that, Ms. Giffords made her way quietly out of the room.Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the committee, began by noting that “the Second Amendment is secure and will remain secure and protected,” adding, “Americans have the right to self-defense and to have guns in their homes to protect their families.”Mr. Leahy, who has a record of supporting measures like an assault weapons ban but also of defending the rights of gun owners in his largely rural state, said: “No one can or will take those rights or our guns away,” and added: “But lives are at risk when responsible people fail to stand up for laws that will keep guns out of the hands of those who will use them to commit mass murder. I ask that we focus our discussion on additional statutory measures to better protect our children and all Americans.”Mr. Leahy promoted his own bill that would give law enforcement officials more tools to investigate so-called straw purchasing of guns, in which people buy firearms for others. But he did not push for a ban on assault weapons, and except for Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, who has her own bill in which a ban renewal is central, most people’s comments focused on background checks and mental health provisions to prevent the wrong people from obtaining guns.Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, set the tone for gun-rights advocates by noting that while the tragedy of Newtown has shocked and rattled the nation, the events should not “be used to put forward every gun-control measure that has been floating around for years.”The hearing took some turns into gender and class politics, as Mr. LaPierre suggested that armed security details were the purview of the wealthy and the well connected, leaving regular Americans in peril.“If you’re in the elite, you get bodyguards,” he said, adding, “Criminals don’t obey the law anyway.” He also said that to the hard-working American “we’re going to say you can have a bolt-action rifle, but you can’t have an AR-15.”While advocates of more gun control tugged at emotions with anecdotes of random gun violence, one witness, Gayle Trotter, a senior fellow at the conservative Independent Women’s Forum, argued for female gun ownership, citing the case of women protecting their children against an intruder. “An assault weapon in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon,” she said."

In so doing, the union is passing over Mr. Thompson, who is running again, as well as Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, and John C.

New York City, although overwhelmingly Democratic, has not elected a Democrat as mayor since 1989, and labor unions are eager to end that lengthy streak.“Chris has shown not just that she is a progressive candidate, but that she is a progressive candidate who knows how to use the levers of government,” Mr. Appelbaum said. “We just can’t be complacent and put up anyone as the Democratic standard-bearer. She provides the best vehicle for progressives for the first time in 20 years.”Mr. Appelbaum said that while he liked the other major Democrats, Ms. Quinn was “a clear choice” this year. He said that union leaders voted unanimously for Ms. Quinn because the union wanted to “send a message to other progressives.”“She’s not Bloomberg,” he added.The retail workers have wrestled with Ms. Quinn over measures to require that some businesses pay a “living wage,” and to mandate paid sick leave for some workers. The Council ultimately passed a watered-down living wage measure, but Ms. Quinn has blocked action on the sick leave bill.“She sees it as her responsibility to make sure it’s done in the appropriate way, instead of just looking to create a political issue that can be used in a mayoral campaign,” Mr. Appelbaum said. “I feel comfortable with her.”Mr. Appelbaum also credited Ms. Quinn with seeking to prevent a Walmart from opening in the city, and to limit the deportations of immigrants who commit minor crimes.Labor endorsements are much-sought in New York City politics, but their value is the subject of considerable debate. Many unions have a track record of siding with losing candidates, and political consultants say that in mayoral campaigns, union members are likely to form their own political opinions, rather than simply follow the guidance of union leaders, when choosing candidates. But labor unions could play a big role in the 2013 election, when all of the Democratic candidates plan to participate in a public financing system with relatively low spending limits.In an interview, Ms. Quinn said that she was “thrilled” because “Stu is one of the leading progressive Democratic voices,” and that, if elected, she looked forward to a “real partnership” that would create “a powerful one-two punch for working men and women.”She added that “if Stu Appelbaum thinks I am the best candidate to go toe-to-toe against the Republicans, I’m incredibly honored by that assessment.”“I take that as a huge Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval,” she said.In recent mayoral elections, many unions either endorsed Mr. Bloomberg or endorsed no one. But this year, some of the major unions have pledged to seek to play more active roles, including unions representing teachers (the United Federation of Teachers); health care workers (Service Employees International Union 1199); building employees (Local 32BJ of Service Employees International Union); and hotel workers (Hotel Trades Council).The consensus is that Mr. de Blasio would benefit most from the backing of labor, because Ms. Quinn has the support of many business and pro-Bloomberg Democrats, and Mr. Thompson is counting on heavy support from African-Americans. So far, only one other union has declared a preference in the race: United Food and Commercial Workers Union Local 1500, which is backing Ms. Quinn this year after supporting Mr. Bloomberg in 2009."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/nyregion/aides-go-on-trial-but-comptroller-john-c-liu-faces-judgment.html,"In 2009, a confidential informer who had been providing information to the Federal Bureau of Investigation for more than a decade told the authorities about an illegal campaign finance scheme that was benefiting John C. Liu, a councilman from Flushing, Queens, who would soon be elected New York City comptroller.The informer said that an acquaintance of his, a large Liu donor, was moving “money around” because he could not legally contribute money in a single lump sum, and Mr. Liu “was aware” that he was trying to “conceal the nature” of his contributions, a court filing shows.That tip led to a sprawling federal investigation into Mr. Liu’s campaign finances, and the filing of criminal charges, not against Mr. Liu, but against two allies — a former campaign treasurer and a fund-raiser — who are scheduled for trial in Manhattan next week.The F.B.I. and federal prosecutors have not said whether their exhaustive investigation of Mr. Liu is nearing an end, but people briefed on the inquiry who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter, have said the investigation has all but concluded. They noted that while agents and prosecutors were far from exonerating Mr. Liu, the undercover phase of the investigation and the wiretaps had failed to yield evidence that could support charges against him.Nonetheless, court filings have already presented an unflattering portrait of Mr. Liu, a Democrat who is running for mayor, and his campaign finances, raising questions about his management style, his character and what he might have known about any misconduct.In essence, the trial could render a public judgment on him.Mr. Liu, 46, has insisted that he committed no wrongdoing. He has continued to attend political events, raise money and tend to the daily demands of his comptroller’s post, in which he oversees the city’s $70 billion budget and helps manage its more than $120 billion in pension funds. Last year, he almost seemed to be challenging prosecutors when he told an interviewer that his campaign staff, which is separate, had acted “with the highest level of ethics.”“If there’s anything that my campaign is guilty of, or my supporters or my staff or, by extension, me, then prove it,” he added in the interview with NY1.Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, declined to comment, as did the F.B.I. Mr. Bharara has previously alleged that the former treasurer, Jia Hou, was “a central figure in a coordinated scheme to break the city’s campaign finance laws,” and that the fund-raiser, Xing Wu Pan, had sought to “subvert” the campaign finance laws.Ms. Hou and Mr. Pan have been accused of conspiring to illegally funnel campaign contributions to Mr. Liu through “straw donors” — people whose contributions are reimbursed by others.A criminal complaint charges that Mr. Pan, for example, used straw donors to arrange for a $16,000 contribution to Mr. Liu’s campaign — from a purported Texas businessman who called himself Richard Kong but who was actually an undercover F.B.I. agent participating in a sting operation.Related allegations were apparently raised against another senior Liu aide, Sharon Lee. A court hearing this week revealed that Ms. Lee was expected to be compelled to testify for the government under an immunity order to say she solicited campaign contributions from friends and family members and offered to reimburse them. She has not been charged with a crime.Court filings show that the authorities obtained judicial approval to listen in on Mr. Liu’s phone conversations for a year and a half, starting in 2010, and that the government obtained 10 wiretaps on 6 phones belonging to Mr. Liu; a top aide, Mei-Hua Ru; Mr. Pan, and others.Mr. Liu’s lawyer, Paul Shechtman, said last week that the original 2009 tip from the informer that appears to have prompted the investigation remained “uncorroborated.” An F.B.I. affidavit says the informer, who has been convicted of federal crimes, was not a paid source and “has never been found to be untruthful in any material respect.”“Whatever the outcome of the trial,” Mr. Shechtman said, “the evidence will show that John Liu has tried as much as anyone ever in public life to run a clean campaign.” He said the jury would hear a recording of Mr. Pan telling an undercover F.B.I. agent who was posing as a campaign donor that “if he contributes to John Liu’s campaign, John will do nothing in return.”“That speaks volumes about John Liu,” Mr. Shechtman added.Still, despite Mr. Shechtman’s characterization of Mr. Liu’s efforts, his campaigns — both for comptroller in 2009 and the current race for mayor — have been criticized for refusing to make required disclosures under the city’s campaign finance law, including reporting the names of people, known as bundlers, who collected contributions for Mr. Liu from other donors.A 2011 article in The New York Times cited some two dozen irregularities in Mr. Liu’s campaign finance reports. In some instances, people listed as having given to Mr. Liu said that they had not or that someone else gave for them, or were listed as employees of companies they did not work for.Court documents filed in the Hou and Pan case suggest Mr. Liu was actively involved in managing his campaign, and was among those who had access, for example, to the campaign’s shared online Google document, one filing shows.Mr. Pan’s lawyers have told Judge Richard J. Sullivan of Federal District Court that they may call Mr. Liu as a defense witness. Even if he does not testify, his name is likely to be cited by witnesses and in documents introduced before the jury.The defendants, Ms. Hou and Mr. Pan, are each charged with conspiracy and attempted wire fraud; Ms. Hou, 26, also faces counts of obstruction of justice and making false statements. Each count carries a maximum 20-year prison sentence.Ms. Hou and Mr. Pan are longtime supporters of Mr. Liu, who was the first Asian-American elected to a citywide office in New York.In a court affidavit, Mr. Pan, who is in his mid-40s, called himself “a minor fund-raiser” for Mr. Liu and described what he portrayed as almost overbearing efforts by the government to win his cooperation in the Liu investigation. He said F.B.I. agents visited him about a month before his arrest in November 2011. “They told me that I had to do whatever they demanded of me, such as allowing them to listen in on my telephone conversations with Mr. Liu and his staff, and even wearing a recording device when I met with anyone from the Liu campaign,” Mr. Pan said.In interviews with the F.B.I. before their arrests, neither Mr. Pan nor Ms. Hou implicated Mr. Liu in wrongdoing, the agency’s summaries show.Ms. Hou’s lawyer, Gerald B. Lefcourt, has contended in court papers that the government undertook an “obsessive pursuit” of Mr. Liu.“As each tactic failed to find evidence of criminal conduct, rather than abandoning the quest, the government simply came up with a new tactic,” he wrote. “Yet for all the resources expended, a case against John Liu has never been made.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/investigation-to-focus-on-governors-handling-of-penn-state-abuse-case.html,"HARRISBURG, Pa. — First it was a criminal case. Then it enveloped a university athletic program. Now the Penn State child sexual abuse scandal has infiltrated the realm of politics.Pennsylvania’s new attorney general is set to name a special prosecutor in the coming days to investigate Gov. Tom Corbett’s handling of the case, specifically why nearly three years elapsed before criminal charges were brought.Attorney General Kathleen Kane, a Democrat elected in November, confirmed her plans in an interview here. She suggested that when he was attorney general Mr. Corbett, a Republican, slow-walked the investigation of a longtime football coach at the center of the scandal while campaigning for governor.Mr. Corbett, who was elected in 2010, has flatly rejected the suggestion that he delayed the case.But polls show that a majority of Pennsylvania voters are critical of his handling of the investigation, and Ms. Kane’s inquiry is likely to cast a shadow over his bid for a second term in 2014.Ms. Kane was elected by the largest margin of any candidate on the state ballot last November — even President Obama — and said she had no interest in challenging Mr. Corbett for governor in two years. But other members of her party acknowledged that there is a risk if her investigation becomes seen as a vendetta.“Clearly, this is a very delicate issue on the political side,” said Jay Costa, the Democratic minority leader in the State Senate. “If she creates an atmosphere that this is a witch hunt or whatever and she has already reached a conclusion, that’s not good.”Mr. Corbett, 63, recently returned to the Penn State matter, an unhealed wound for many Pennsylvanians even after the conviction last year of the former coach, Jerry Sandusky, for molesting 10 boys. In early January, the governor brought a lawsuit to lift the stiff penalties imposed on Penn State by the National Collegiate Athletic Association as a result of the episode.The suit seeks to rescind a $60 million fine, a four-year ban on postseason football games and the forfeit of 112 Penn State football victories over a dozen years. It was filed six months after Mr. Corbett called on Pennsylvanians to accept the punishment, and it was widely viewed as calculated to win support from the legions of alumni who bleed Penn State blue and white.Many Pennsylvania newspaper editorial boards concluded that the action was transparently political.Mr. Corbett’s approval ratings are historically low for a first-term governor of his state. “I don’t think there’s any doubt” that Mr. Corbett’s handling of the case is “a contributing factor in his poor job performance” in polls, said G. Terry Madonna, who directs the Franklin & Marshall College Poll. “Do I think it’s an issue that will play out? The answer is yes.”Beyond tarnishing its legendary football program, the Penn State scandal pointed at a cover-up by university leaders, including a former president who is awaiting trial.Mr. Corbett declined to be interviewed for this article. He has denied delaying or mishandling any aspect of the investigation.“The governor is happy to talk to anybody about it, including Kathleen Kane,” said his spokesman, Kevin Harley. “The proof is the conviction of Jerry Sandusky on 45 of 48 counts, and he will spend the rest of his life in jail because of the work of the men and women in the attorney general’s office and the State Police.”Ms. Kane, 46, is a former county prosecutor who specialized in child sex abuse cases. She questioned why it took 33 months to arrest Mr. Sandusky in late 2011 after Mr. Corbett, as attorney general, received a complaint against Mr. Sandusky in the spring of 2009.“It’s never taken me that long” to build a case against a molester, Ms. Kane said in the Harrisburg office she had just moved into, a Carpe Diem paperweight on her desk, adding that speed matters because child abusers seek new victims. “I was on the campaign trail almost two years; I didn’t go a single place without somebody asking me why it took so long.”She also questioned the influence of campaign donations Mr. Corbett received from a charity Mr. Sandusky founded, the Second Mile, whose board members contributed to Mr. Corbett’s run for governor. Investigators at the time suspected Mr. Sandusky of using the foundation, which helped troubled youth, to find victims.Mr. Corbett’s spokesman said he could not have returned the Second Mile contributions because at the time the case was before the grand jury and he was sworn to secrecy.Ms. Kane also questioned whether Mr. Corbett devoted enough staff to the investigation and whether agents were trained to pursue child abusers.Mr. Corbett has said his investigation moved slowly because for a long time there was only a single accuser against Mr. Sandusky. Investigators feared that the evidence was too weak to win a conviction.“The criticism that Ms. Kane has is that she would never have put this in a grand jury,” Mr. Corbett told The Philadelphia Inquirer last week. “My observation is, I don’t think she’s ever been involved in a grand jury or understands how it operates.”Ms. Kane replied that in her 12 years as an assistant district attorney in Lackawanna County, she brought at least a half-dozen cases to grand juries — though never for child abuse, because young victims are distraught having to speak to 30 or more jurors.Randy Feathers, who supervised the investigating agents when Mr. Corbett was attorney general, said that from the time he got the assignment several months after the initial accusation there were at least two to four agents pursuing the case.It took as long as it did, he said, because “we felt like we had no shot” winning in court with just a single victim testifying against Mr. Sandusky, who “walked on water” as an assistant for 31 years to the famous Penn State head coach, Joe Paterno.So they looked for other victims. “You very rarely find a predator in those circumstances who only molested one kid,” said Mr. Feathers, now retired. “Our job was to find those kids.”He added, “Tom Corbett had nothing to do with slowing anything down.”Ms. Kane said she would accept whatever conclusion the special prosecutor reached.“I am not afraid at the very end, after every stone has been turned, to tell everyone, ‘Nothing went wrong here,’ ” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/opinion/myths-about-gun-regulation.html,"As busy as the gun lobby is in promoting macho myths about self-defense — stand your ground and outshoot the bad guys — it is no less dedicated to spinning myths for lawmakers to use as excuses to avoid enacting laws to deal with the shooting sprees that regularly afflict the nation. This was clear at the opening Senate hearing on gun controls this week, where Judiciary Committee members seemed to have largely swallowed gun lobby propaganda that the evidence shows the original 10-year ban on assault weapons was ineffective.Left unsaid was the fact that one of the loopholes that enabled passage of the original ban limited research on the law’s effectiveness to the first year’s data rather than allow more conclusive long-term studies. A long–range, independent study issued as Congress allowed the ban to expire in 2004 found criminal use of assault weapons had fallen by one-third or more as a share of gun crimes in major jurisdictions.The information is there if Congress is interested. After the ban expired, 37 percent of police departments reported noticeable increases in criminals’ use of assault weapons, according to a 2010 report by the Police Executive Research Forum.In Virginia, the number of guns with high-capacity magazines seized by police dropped after they were included in the 1994 weapons ban, but then rebounded sharply after the ban expired, according to a 2011 study by The Washington Post. Maryland enacted its own more stringent ban on assault weapons in 1994, and a 55 percent drop in assault pistols from crime scenes was reported by the Baltimore police.The false statistics comfort members of Congress who fear the gun lobby or their more conservative constituents, or both, and are blocking a new and stronger ban on assault weapons proposed by Senator Dianne Feinstein. The need for that ban and its outlawing of magazines of more than 10 bullets goes to the heart of the tragedy in Newtown, Conn., where a shooter took only a few minutes to trigger a rapid firing assault weapon and slay 20 schoolchildren and six educators last December.“Too many children are dying,” former Representative Gabrielle Giffords declared at the Senate hearing, her speech made halting by the head wounds she suffered in a 2011 gun assault. “You must act. Be bold,” she pleaded with the lawmakers.Since the hearing run by Senator Patrick Leahy seemed stacked with opponents of a new ban, Senator Feinstein is scheduling her own hearing with a fairer slate of witnesses reflecting the public’s concern about the carnage from assault weapons. The judiciary hearing should be a call to President Obama to fight hard for maximum public involvement if an assault weapons ban is ever to have a chance in congress. “Be courageous,” Ms. Giffords advised the lawmakers. “Americans are counting on you.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/nyregion/medgar-evers-college-president-resigns.html,"The president of Medgar Evers College, the predominantly black public college in central Brooklyn, announced his resignation Thursday, the culmination of three and a half years of conflicts with students and faculty on issues from academic policy to community relations.Reached by phone, the president, William L. Pollard, said, “There’s a point in everyone’s history when you look at the wear and tear on yourself and your family and people who are close to you, and you ask yourself: Are you pleased with what you’ve done thus far? If you can answer that question affirmatively, then maybe that’s a good time to go. That’s basically what I did.”Jay Hershenson, a spokesman for the City University of New York, of which Medgar Evers is a part, would not confirm or deny whether Dr. Pollard was asked to leave. But Matthew Goldstein, the CUNY chancellor, issued a statement thanking Dr. Pollard for his service: “The president has worked diligently to focus this important institution in Central Brooklyn on student-centered goals and objectives, enhancing faculty instruction in the classroom, and on utilizing the new and modern campus facilities in creative and effective ways.”Dr. Pollard will stay on at the school until a successor is named, after a national search.In a statement, he said he had been contemplating the move for some time, but waited until now, when “the college is headed in the direction of renewed academic momentum and fiscal responsibility.” He appended a list of his accomplishments, including increasing the contact that first- and second-year students have with full-time faculty, strengthening the curriculum, attracting professors with Ivy League degrees, improving various facilities and deepening ties to the community.But critics have accused Dr. Pollard of pushing through initiatives without regard to their impact on the community and without an appreciation for the institution’s history. One subject in particular that raised ire on campus was his relationship to the Center for NuLeadership on Urban Solutions, a group that advocated for former prisoners. Dr. Pollard asked for evidence of the group’s effectiveness, and hesitated to approve a $2.4 million grant proposal to bring nonviolent drug offenders to Medgar Evers.The faculty twice passed votes of no confidence against his administration, and on Oct. 17, several hundred students staged a classroom walkout to demand the resignation of Dr. Pollard and his provost, Howard C. Johnson.Professor Sallie M. Cuffee, chairwoman of the faculty Senate, said that women in leadership positions had felt mistreated and left the school. She also cited “the dismantling of the writing center at Medgar Evers and the reduction of resources to student services and the reallocation of those resources to the office of student affairs, where a number of consultants were hired.”But Dr. Pollard did have his supporters. A letter written earlier this week by a half-dozen faculty members urged the chancellor to let Dr. Pollard stay and “not destabilize the college based on the antics of a small group of faculty members, several of whom have personal grievances.”Dr. Pollard surprised some when he asked department heads for plans on how to reduce course offerings by almost a third — a consequence, they were told, of declining enrollment.And this past November, the Middle States Commission on Higher Education, which accredits colleges in the region, warned Medgar Evers that it was in danger of losing its accreditation.“Would you want to go to a school that was in the papers for accreditation issues?” asked Elizabeth Defelice, 43, a Harlem student. “College is about word of mouth. I’d be telling people I went here and they’d be like, ‘Are you serious?’ ”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/nyregion/senator-menendezs-ties-to-political-donor-are-scrutinized.html,"Dr. Salomon E. Melgen, a wealthy Florida eye surgeon, has always been happy to help out his friend, Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey.He rushed to the senator’s side when Mr. Menendez’s mother died, flew him around on his private jet and delivered hundreds of thousands of dollars to benefit Mr. Menendez and the national Democratic Party.Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, has also been helpful to Dr. Melgen, according to records and interviews, in ways that could bring the doctor a highly lucrative windfall.Two years ago, Dr. Melgen, despite an apparent lack of experience in border security issues, bought an ownership interest in a company that had a long-dormant contract with the Dominican Republic to provide port security. Mr. Menendez, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that holds sway over the Dominican Republic, subsequently urged officials in the State and Commerce Departments to intervene so the contract would be enforced, at an estimated value of $500 million.This week, a team of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided Dr. Melgen’s offices in West Palm Beach, removing 30 boxes of documents and other material, and the senator now finds himself defending his relationship with a major political benefactor just as he is on the verge of reaching the most prestigious post of his career — the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.An F.B.I. spokesman declined to describe the focus of the agency’s inquiry. A law enforcement official cautioned that there were many issues involving Dr. Melgen that could be under scrutiny.On Wednesday, Dr. Melgen released a statement through his lawyer: “The government has not informed Dr. Melgen what its concerns are. However, we are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times.”Mr. Menendez, who was re-elected last year, declined to be interviewed. His office issued a statement, saying, in part, “Dr. Melgen has been a friend and political supporter of Senator Menendez for many years,” and an aide said in an interview that the senator had done nothing improper in advocating for Dr. Melgen’s business interests.Aides to the senator said, however, that Mr. Menendez had accepted two round-trip flights aboard Dr. Melgen’s jet for personal vacations in the Dominican Republic in 2010. He failed to report them as gifts or reimburse Dr. Melgen at the time, as required, and this month he sent the doctor a check to cover the cost of the flights.The friendship between the two men goes back to the 1990s, when Mr. Menendez, who entered the House of Representatives in 1993, began regularly visiting the Dominican Republic. They spent holidays together, often in the Dominican Republic, where Dr. Melgen has a home in Casa de Campo, a gated oceanfront resort where houses cost as much as $20 million and which has been home to some of the country’s richest residents, like Oscar de la Renta.Both enjoyed a good cigar and playing golf; Casa de Campo has several places to play, designed by the renowned course architect Pete Dye.Dr. Melgen, who friends say longed to play the role of power broker, and his wife began donating to Mr. Menendez’s Congressional campaigns in the late 1990s, and their contributions grew, along with their friendship, over the years. By the time of the 2009-10 election cycle, when Mr. Menendez took charge of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, Dr. Melgen became an important fund-raiser for the effort. In May 2010, he flew the senator to the Dominican Republic and held a fund-raiser at his home. He and his wife gave the committee $60,000 and helped raised more.Later that summer, Dr. Melgen also flew Mr. Menendez to the Dominican Republic for the two short personal vacations, in August and September. Aides said it was simply because of sloppy paperwork that the senator did not repay Dr. Melgen at the time. After reports surfaced late last year on The Daily Caller, a conservative Web site, about his travels with Dr. Melgen, the senator recently sent Dr. Melgen’s company a check for $58,500.Also in 2010, Dr. Melgen moved to buy the ownership interest in ICSSI, a company based in the Caribbean that had been awarded a contract to provide extensive screening of cargo from ports in the Dominican Republic. The Dominican government was refusing to honor that contract, after Miguel Cocco, then the Dominican customs director, had long said the deal was an exorbitant giveaway to the company.In a letter to the president’s legal adviser, Mr. Cocco said that the deal was “against the interests of the Dominican government, due to its one-sided nature, exorbitant clauses, that it violates Dominican laws,” and that there had been a “lack of transparency, commercial ethics in the granting of the contract.”Dr. Melgen brought the matter to the attention of Mr. Menendez. Estimates vary on the contract’s value, but critics say it could cost as much as $50 million annually; the original terms of the contract, approved in 2003, called for 20 years of payments.The American Chamber of Commerce of the Dominican Republic has opposed the deal. Some Dominican business leaders have suggested that Dr. Melgen is trying to use his political connections to force the contract to be paid.“The owners of ICSSI have been actively seeking a partner who would be able to get the contract implemented,” the chamber’s executive vice president, William Malamud, said. “He seemed to convince them that he had what it takes. But he has, to my knowledge, no previous experience in port security.”Aides acknowledged on Wednesday that Mr. Menendez had spoken to State Department officials about the contract. And at a hearing of the Senate Foreign Relations Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere last July, he questioned two administration officials — Francisco J. Sánchez, the undersecretary for international trade at the Commerce Department, and Matthew Rooney, the deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs for the State Department — about why the United States government had not been more aggressive on the issue. The senator said more security was needed given the drug trade on the island.“You have another company that has American investors that is seeking to — has a contract actually given to it by the — kind of ratified by the Dominican Congress to do X-ray of all of the cargo that goes through the ports, which have been problematic and for which in the past narcotics have been included in those cargo,” the senator said at the hearing, according to a transcript provided by the National Legal and Policy Center, a government watchdog group. “And they don’t want to live by the contract either. You have some of the other countries that I have mentioned today with arbitration awards that have gone against them, and yet they don’t want to live by that. Well, what are we willing to do?”Mr. Menendez’s chief of staff, Daniel O’Brien, said there was nothing unusual about the advocacy, saying the senator had always fought for “U.S. companies that are not being treated fairly or have issues pending in foreign countries.”But Ken Boehm, the chairman of the government watchdog group, called the actions troubling. “At a minimum, the public is entitled to know more about this relationship,” Mr. Boehm said. “It’s a matter of transparency and accountability.”Supporters of Dr. Melgen said he and the senator were now the focus of attacks because Dominican drug traffickers want to undermine the port deal.The friendship between the two men is a focus among prominent Latinos, especially those with interests involving the Obama administration.“Whenever I see Menendez, I see him with this medical doctor,” said Bernardo Vega, a former Dominican ambassador to the United States and now editor of a magazine that has been critical of the port deal.In Florida political circles, one Miami Democrat explained, it is understood that anyone seeking a federal appointment that requires Mr. Menendez’s blessing should first get Dr. Melgen’s backing.“If you needed Bob, you had to see Melgen,” said the Democrat, who insisted on anonymity for fear of upsetting party leaders. “Everybody in Miami knew that.”In addition to the security company, in 2011 Dr. Melgen founded a Latino-oriented news Web site, Voxxi, which has also emphasized the need for the port security deal and glowingly depicted Mr. Menendez as a giant among Latinos. A former employee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of fear of career damage, said Dr. Melgen would often intervene in the coverage, requiring editors to play down achievements by Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and replace it with praise for Mr. Menendez.And Dr. Melgen may have found another route to help Mr. Menendez and his party in the elections last fall, when the senator faced Joe Kyrillos, a Republican in the New Jersey Senate, whose candidacy was heavily promoted by one of Mr. Menendez’s chief antagonists — Gov. Chris Christie.In the end, Mr. Menendez won with about 58 percent of the vote, partly because of the support he received from Majority PAC, a “super PAC” set up by former aides to Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic majority leader.As the campaign entered its final weeks, the PAC poured $582,500 into New Jersey to support Mr. Menendez’s re-election effort. One of the organization’s biggest donors? Dr. Melgen’s company, which donated $700,000 between June and October."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/politics/text-of-chuck-hagels-opening-remarks.html,"The following is Chuck Hagel’s opening remarks to the Senate Armed Services Committee, as prepared for delivery.Thank you Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Inhofe, and Distinguished Members of the Committee. I am honored to come before you today as the President’s nominee to be Secretary of Defense.I want to thank my friends Sam Nunn and John Warner for their support, encouragement, and friendship over many years. These two distinguished Americans represent what’s best about American public service and responsible bipartisanship. They have embodied both in their careers and are models for each of us.To my family, friends, and fellow veterans who are here this morning – and those who are not – thank you. A life is only as good as the family and friends you have and the people you surround yourself with.I also want to thank my friend Leon Panetta for his tremendous service to our country over so many years. If I’m given the privilege of succeeding him, it will be a high honor.Finally, I want to thank President Obama for his confidence and trust in me. I am humbled by the opportunity and possibility he has given me to serve our country once again.I fully recognize the immense responsibilities of the Secretary of Defense. I assured the President that if I am confirmed by the United States Senate, I will always do my best for our nation and for the men and women – and their families –who are called on to make the enormous sacrifices of military service. Their safety, success, and welfare will always be at the forefront of the decisions I make.I also assured the President that I would always provide him with my most honest and informed advice. I make that same commitment to this Committee and to the Congress. If confirmed, I will reach out to the members of this Committee for advice and collaboration. It will be a partnership, because the national security challenges America faces require it.Our nation’s security is the highest priority of our leaders and our government. We cannot allow the work of confronting the great threats we face today to be held hostage to partisanship on either side of the aisle, or by differences between the bodies represented in Articles I and II of our Constitution. The stakes are too high. Men and women of all political philosophies and parties fight and die for our country. As this Committee knows so well, protecting our national security or committing a nation to war can never become political litmus tests. I know Secretary Panetta has put a strong emphasis on reaching out to the Congress. I, like Leon, come from the Congress, and respect and understand this institution’s indispensable role in setting policy and helping govern our country.We are all products of the forces that shape us. For me, there has been nothing more important in my life – or a more defining influence on my life – than my family. Whether it was helping my mother raise four boys after my father – a World War II veteran – died suddenly at age 39 on Christmas Day, or serving side by side my brother Tom in Vietnam, or the wonderful miracle of my wife Lilibet and me being blessed with two beautiful children. That is who I am. We each bring to our responsibilities “frames of reference” formed by our life’sexperiences. They help instruct our judgments. We build out from those personal foundations by continually informing ourselves, listening, and learning.Like each of you, I have a record. A record I am proud of, not because of any accomplishments I may have achieved, or an absence of mistakes, but rather because I’ve tried to build that record by living my life and fulfilling my responsibilities as honestly as I knew how and with hard work. Under-pinning everything I’ve done in my life was the belief that we must always be striving to make our nation a better and more secure place for all of our people.During the twelve years I had the privilege of serving the people of Nebraska in the United States Senate, I cast over 3,000 votes and hundreds of Committee votes. I’ve also given hundreds of interviews and speeches, and written a book. So, as you all know, I am on the record on many issues.But no one individual vote, quote, or statement defines me, my beliefs, or my record. My overall worldview has never changed: that America has and must maintain the strongest military in the world; that we must lead the international community to confront threats and challenges together; and that we must use all tools of American power to protect our citizens and our interests. I believe, and always have, that America must engage – not retreat – in the world. My record is consistent on these points.It’s clear that we are living at a defining time. Our nation is emerging from over a decade of war. We have brought our men and women in uniform home from Iraq, and have started to bring them home from Afghanistan.That does not mean the threats we face and will continue to face are any less dangerous or complicated. In fact, it is quite the opposite. Recent events in Mali and Algeria remind us of this reality. Twenty first century complexities,technologies, economies, and threats are bringing the seven billion global citizens closer together. And as our planet adds another two billion people over the next 25 years, the dangers, complications, and human demands will not be lessened, but rather heightened.Despite these challenges, I believe we also have historic opportunities to help build a safer, more prosperous, more secure, more hopeful and just world than at maybe any time in history. Yes, the curse of intolerance, hatred, and danger exists around the world, and we must continue to be clear-eyed about this danger – and we will be. We will not hesitate to use the full force of the United States military in defense of our security. But we must also be smart, and more importantly wise, in how we employ all of our nation’s great power.America’s continued leadership and strength at home and abroad will be critically important for our country and the world. While we will not hesitate to act unilaterally when necessary, it is essential that we work closely with our allies and partners to enhance America’s influence and security – as well as global security. If confirmed, I will continue to build on the efforts of this administration and of former Secretary Gates, Secretary Panetta, and Secretary Clinton to strengthen our alliances and partnerships around the world. I will also look forward to working with my former Senate colleague and friend, John Kerry, in this effort.As I told the President, I am committed to his positions on all issues of national security, specifically decisions that the Department of Defense is in the process of implementing. This includes the Defense Strategic Guidance the President outlined in January 2012. Allow me to briefly address a few of those specific issues now.First, we have a plan in place to transition out of Afghanistan, continue bringing our troops home, and end the war there – which has been the longest war in America’s history. As you know, discussions are ongoing about what the U.S. presence in Afghanistan will look like after 2014. The President has made clear – and I agree – that there should be only two functions for U.S. troops that remain in Afghanistan after 2014: counterterrorism – particularly to target al Qaeda and its affiliates, and training and advising Afghan forces. It’s time we forge a new partnership with Afghanistan, with its government and, importantly, with its people.Second, as Secretary of Defense I will ensure we stay vigilant and keep up the pressure on terrorist organizations as they try to expand their affiliates around the world, in places like Yemen, Somalia, and North Africa. At the Pentagon, that means continuing to invest in and build the tools to assist in that fight, such as special operations forces and new intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance technologies. And it will mean working hand-in-hand with our partners across the national security and intelligence communities, to confront these and other threats, especially the emerging threat of cyber warfare.Third, as I have made clear, I am fully committed to the President’s goal of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and – as I’ve said in the past – all options must be on the table to achieve that goal. My policy is one of prevention, and not one of containment – and the President has made clear that is the policy of our government. As Secretary of Defense, I will make sure the Department is prepared for any contingency. I will ensure our friend and ally Israel maintains its Qualitative Military Edge in the region and will continue to support systems like Iron Dome, which is today saving Israeli lives from terrorist rocket attacks.Fourth, while we pursue the reductions in our deployed stockpiles and launchers consistent with the New START Treaty, I am committed to maintaining a modern, strong, safe, ready, and effective nuclear arsenal. America’s nuclear deterrent over the last 65 years has played a central role in ensuring global security and the avoidance of a World War III. I am committed to modernizing our nuclear arsenal.As we emerge from this decade of war, we also must broaden our nation’s focus overseas as we look at future threats and challenges. As this Committee knows, that’s why DoD is rebalancing its resources towards the Asia-Pacific region. We are in the process of modernizing our defense posture across the entire region to defend and deepen our partnerships with traditional allies, especially Japan, South Korea, and Australia; to continue to deter and defend against provocations from states like North Korea, as well as non-state actors; and to expand our networks of security cooperation throughout the region to combat terrorism, counter proliferation, provide disaster relief, fight piracy, and ensure maritime security.I will continue this rebalancing, even as we continue to work closely with our longtime NATO allies and friends, and with allies and partners in other regions. At the same time, we will continue to focus on challenges in the Middle East and North Africa, where we have clear national interests. Rather, it is a recognition that the United States has been and always will be a Pacific power, and the Asia- Pacific is an increasingly vital part of the globe for America’s security and economy. That’s why we must become even more engaged in the region over the coming years.Doing all of this and much more will require smart and strategic budget decisions. I have made it clear I share Leon Panetta’s and our service chiefs’ serious concerns about the impact sequestration would have on our armed forces. And as someonewho has run businesses, I know the uncertainty and turbulence of the current budget climate makes it much more difficult to manage the Pentagon’s resources. If confirmed, I am committed to effectively and efficiently using every single taxpayer dollar; to maintaining the strongest military in the world; and to working with Congress to ensure the Department has the resources it needs – and that the disposition of those resources is accountable.Even as we deal with difficult budget decisions, I will never break America’s commitment to our troops, our veterans, and our military families. We will continue to invest in the well-being of our all-volunteer force. And, working with the VA and other institutions, we will make sure our troops and their families get the health care, job opportunities, and education they have earned and deserve – just as I did when I co-authored the Post-9/11 G.I. Bill with Senators Jim Webb, John Warner, and Frank Lautenberg. This includes focusing on the mental health of our fighting force, because no one who volunteers to fight and die for our country should feel like they have nowhere to turn.In my twelve years in the Senate, my one guiding principle on every national security decision I made and every vote I cast was always this: Is our policy worthy of our troops and their families and the sacrifices we ask them to make? That same question will guide me if I am confirmed as Secretary of Defense. Our men and women in uniform and their families must never doubt that their leaders’ first priority is them. I believe my record of leadership on veterans issues over the years – going back to my service in the Veterans Administration under President Reagan – demonstrates my rock-solid commitment to our veterans and their families.We must always take care of our people. That’s why I will work to ensure that everyone who volunteers to fight for this country has the same rights and opportunities. As I’ve discussed with many of you in our meetings, I am fully committed to implementing the repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell and doing everything possible under current law to provide equal benefits to the families of all our service members. I will work with the service chiefs as we officially open combat positions to women, a decision that I strongly support. And I will continue the important work that Leon Panetta has done to combat sexual assault in the military. Maintaining the health and well-being of those who serve is critical to maintaining a strong and capable military, because an institution’s people must always come first.As we look ahead to the coming years, we have an extraordinary opportunity now to define what’s next for America’s military and our country. It is incumbent upon all of us to make decisions that will ensure our nation is prepared to confront any threat we may face, protect our citizens, and remain the greatest force for good in the world.If confirmed as Secretary of Defense, it will be my great honor – working with the President, this Committee, the Congress, and our military – to ensure our policies are worthy of the service and sacrifice of America’s finest men and women. Thank you. I look forward to your questions."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/politics/extension-of-debt-limit-clears-congress.html,"WASHINGTON — The Senate gave final approval on Thursday to legislation suspending the statutory debt ceiling until May, officially turning Congress’s attention to the next budget showdown: $1 trillion in across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts set to begin on March 1.The 64-to-34 vote ended for now a clash that had threatened the full faith and credit of the United States government. But the next budget fight is just four weeks away. House Republican leaders insist that the across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, are coming, even as senators in both parties scramble for short- and long-term remedies.Senate Democratic leaders hope to present legislation next week at a party retreat that would mix revenues and spending cuts to replace the first three months of indiscriminate cuts while longer-term negotiations continue.Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, is assembling his own proposal to replace the across-the-board cuts with the elimination of duplicative efforts in the federal government in areas like the promotion of environmentally friendly construction, science and technology education, and work force training.Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has drafted more ambitious legislation to raise nearly $200 billion for sequester replacement by closing off a variety of offshore tax shelters, ending preferential tax treatment for many private equity and hedge fund managers, and taxing the exercise of stock options more heavily.“The fiscal situation is grave enough, the threat of sequestration is so serious in terms of its impact on our domestic priorities and on our security, that I believe that if we can get this in front of the Congress, because it will have huge public support, it will pass,” Mr. Levin said in an interview.But even the architects of such efforts are pessimistic that they have time to win passage.“I think sequester’s going to happen,” Mr. Coburn said. “I think people want it to happen.”Yet the economic recovery remains weak, and unemployment high. This week, Washington got one of the first signs of how the sequester might play out in the economy, when government figures showed that the economy had contracted in the final three months of 2012, largely a result of a 22 percent drop in military spending.Economists cautioned that they did not expect such a precipitous decline to continue in the coming quarters. Moreover, the drop came after a surge in military spending in the third quarter, as offices rushed to spend money obligated to the 2012 fiscal year.Still, the automatic cuts have the potential to derail the recovery. Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis, estimated that if the sequester came into full effect starting in March, it would knock 0.7 percentage points from economic growth in 2013, dropping it to 1.9 percent. Economists say hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more.With half of the sequester hitting military spending, the worst effects would be felt by the Pentagon and military contractors. Congress already cut half a trillion dollars from military spending in the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the sequester would cut a further half-trillion.Defense companies have been engaged in an extensive behind-the-scenes effort to sway lawmakers, and they have warned that the cuts might lead to serious job losses, while also threatening the country’s security. “We’re sounding a full-throated alarm about this,” said Marion Blakey, the president of the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobbying group. “It was never intended to take place. It is terribly bad public policy. And it would have a very negative effect on our economy.”Concerns about the sequester cast a shadow over corporate earnings season in January. Many businesses said they expected Congress to delay or reduce the cuts, but warned of a bleak outlook if they took full effect. “While we recognize that both parties are strongly opposed to allowing sequestration to happen, we remain deeply concerned that sequestration could occur as the default outcome if negotiations fail,” Marillyn A. Hewson, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, told investors in January. “Sequestration not only puts at risk our defense industrial base, it also harms military readiness.”But with just four weeks to go, the search for any replacement for the across-the-board cuts seems to be stumbling out of the gate.Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Thursday that she would try to enlist the White House to help stop her own leadership’s three-month bill. She wants any legislation to last at least a year.“I hope the White House is not colluding with the 90-day reprieve,” she said. “This is like appeals on death row.”Mr. Levin’s tax bill effectively pits the defense industry against other heavyweights, especially high-tech companies like Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Facebook, all of which are singled out by the Levin bill as abusers of the tax code. Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, said military contractors were not going to be drawn into that fight.With the price of failure so high, Mr. Levin and Mr. Coburn said this week that their longstanding quests to cull the tax code of egregious loopholes and cut overlapping government programs could finally succeed. Mr. Levin pointed to two cases in particular. Microsoft develops software in the United States, sells intellectual property rights to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions offshore, then shifts the bulk of its profits from product sales to those tax havens by paying its own subsidiaries royalties. Hewlett-Packard, like many companies, pays no taxes on overseas profits until they are brought back to the United States, but it has been able to keep cash flowing home through a series of tax-free loans from its offshore subsidiaries to its California headquarters.In testimony in September to Mr. Levin’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard executives said they were following the letter of United States tax law, but also said that the law was putting their companies at a disadvantage with competitors from other countries. Mr. Levin conceded that that argument had been persuasive with colleagues for years, as he sought to tighten tax loopholes.In lieu of a deal, Republican senators are drafting legislation at least to give agencies the flexibility to make the cuts more selectively, Mr. Coburn said.“Necessity becomes the mother of invention,” he said. “We’ve got smart people in these agencies. They will do what’s most important and least expensive.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/philadelphia-judges-indicted-in-ticket-case.html,"PHILADELPHIA — Federal prosecutors on Thursday unveiled fraud charges against nine sitting and former Philadelphia Traffic Court judges accused of dismissing or reducing traffic citations for political, business and social associates in return for favors like free car repairs and shipments of seafood.The judges, as well as three business associates, were charged in an indictment unsealed Thursday with conspiracy, mail fraud and wire fraud. They were accused of taking part in a scheme in which tickets issued for offenses like speeding were thrown out or converted to lesser offenses, or the recipient was found not guilty.Those seeking to have their traffic tickets fixed — including local politicians and associates of the Democratic City Committee — would regularly contact the defendants from July 2008 to September 2011, the indictment said.The defendants would then either agree to the request for preferential treatment or hand the case to another judge who would eliminate or reduce fines or points on a driver’s license, depriving the city and state of revenue, prosecutors said.“Defendants created and participated in an extrajudicial system, not sanctioned by the Pennsylvania court system,” the 77-count indictment said, “where they felt free to approach one another and exchange requests for preferential treatment or ‘ticket-fixing,’ without being rebuked or criticized by fellow judges.”All but one of the judges face a maximum sentence of more than 100 years in prison and millions of dollars in fines if convicted on all counts, according to the office of Zane David Memeger, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.One defendant, Fortunato N. Perri, a senior Traffic Court judge, is accused of arranging to fix tickets referred to him by another defendant, Henry P. Alfano, a Philadelphia businessman who owns an automobile salvage yard and two “gentleman’s clubs.” Prosecutors said Mr. Alfano supplied Judge Perri with traffic citation numbers, the names of offenders or the actual citations. In return, Mr. Alfano provided free auto repairs, free towing, free videos and free seafood to Mr. Perri, prosecutors said.Another defendant, Michael J. Sullivan, a sitting Traffic Court judge and bar owner, was accused of directing associates who wanted their tickets fixed to leave them in a box behind the bar. They were assured that the tickets would be taken care of.“I know you’re broke,” Judge Sullivan told a ticket recipient, according to an intercepted telephone conversation cited by prosecutors. “It don’t matter which judge would be hearing the case, because you’re good.”Justice J. Michael Eakin of Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued a statement on Thursday expressing confidence in the Traffic Court system despite the indictment. “Philadelphia Traffic Court remains open, and newly assigned senior magisterial district judges from various counties have been appointed to hear cases,” Justice Eakin said.But the State Senate majority leader, Dominic Pileggi, said the indictment supported proposed legislation to abolish the court. “Traffic Court is not worth saving,” he said.The Judicial Conduct Board of Pennsylvania said it had petitioned the Court of Judicial Discipline to suspend the six sitting judges without pay.Three defendants — Judge Michael Lowry, the former judges Robert Mulgrew and Thomasine Tynes — are also charged with committing perjury before a federal grand jury that investigated the case. A former judge, Willie Singletary, and William Hird, the court’s former director of records, are charged with lying to the F.B.I. about ticket fixing, in addition to the mail and wire-fraud charges.Mr. Singletary, who was elected to Traffic Court in November 2007, led supporters in a local motorcycle club named the Philadelphia First State Road Rattlers to believe that he would offer them preferential treatment if they donated to his election campaign, prosecutors said.“If you all can give me $20, you’re going to need me in Traffic Court, am I right about that?” he told the club, according to the indictment. “You’re all going to need my hookup, right?”Another defendant, a local businessman, Robert Moy, advertised ticket fixing in a local newspaper, saying that he “tackles the traffic ticket and guarantees no points or fewer points,” the indictment said. Prosecutors said that ticket recipients took their citations to Mr. Moy, paid him hundreds of dollars in cash, and were instructed not to appear in Traffic Court, where they were found not guilty by either Judge Tynes or Judge Singletary."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/politics/senators-look-at-07-failure-for-lessons-on-immigration.html,"WASHINGTON — As eight senators in a bipartisan group look ahead to a broad immigration overhaul, they are also looking back to 2006 and 2007 — the last time a major immigration measure was considered — as something of a reverse playbook.Lesson 1? “Make sure you get out there and define what you’re trying to do,” said former Senator Trent Lott, the Mississippi Republican who, in 2007, was the minority whip when his chamber’s immigration efforts imploded. “Don’t forget to pay attention to the message, and don’t let the media define what you’re trying to do.”It is a tip that Mr. Lott says he has communicated to the staff of Senator Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican involved in the current effort, and so far Mr. Rubio seems to be heeding the advice. In recent weeks, he has focused on conservative media powerhouses, tirelessly wooing influential voices on the right like Bill O’Reilly and Rush Limbaugh.“The outreach by Marco Rubio has been very positive,” Mr. Lott said. “He’s very good at explaining what he wants to do.”Getting out ahead by articulating their immigration principles, as the group did in a Monday news conference, is only one of the ways the senators hope to learn from the mistakes of the past. This time, they said, they are capitalizing on a promising political environment, using more conciliatory language, and trying to harness media outlets to their advantage. They also plan to move their legislation through the Judiciary Committee, a step not taken in 2007 and one that helped doom the bill, and are working more closely with businesses and labor unions to make sure the two can also reach a compromise.“Our timing is right,” said Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Democrat in the Senate. “The election results are still fresh in the minds of my Republican colleagues and they don’t want to go through this again.”President George W. Bush said in 2009 that it was “a mistake” to have pushed for changes to Social Security, rather than immigration, immediately after the 2004 election. By the time he took on immigration late in his second term, he was a lame duck president, weakened by the war in Iraq and facing dissent within his party.“By his own admission, President Bush made a strategic error in not pushing the issue right after his re-election,” said Kevin Appleby, the director of migration policy at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops. “President Obama is not making the same mistake. He still has a lot of political capital to spend.”In the wake of the 2012 presidential election, where Mr. Obama’s defeat of Mitt Romney came with the help of 71 percent of the Hispanic vote, those on all sides of the immigration effort believe the climate is ripe for another attempt.And, at least in the early stages, they are taking steps to reach across the aisle, even with the words they choose.“The most important lesson I took way from 2006 and 2007 is that people had no faith that there wouldn’t be future waves of illegal immigrants,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, a Democrat of New York in the Senate’s bipartisan immigration group.To show that he is serious about an overhaul, he explained, he is especially conscious of the language he uses; Mr. Schumer now refers to “illegal immigrants,” a term preferred by the right and an acknowledgment that the 11 million illegal immigrants currently in the country did, in fact, break the law.In a similar linguistic concession, Mr. Rubio, during Monday’s immigration news conference, referred to the “undocumented” workers, a term generally preferred by Democrats and loathed by his party’s conservative wing.In 2007, in an attempt to save time and reach a deal, the Senate bypassed the Judiciary Committee and brought the legislation straight to the floor. At the time, the senators who drafted the bill tried to band together to vote down any amendments that changed the substance of their compromise, an agreement that broke down. Several controversial amendments, including one that then-Senator Obama supported, ultimately led to the bill’s collapse.“What we’re doing now is we’re going to put it through committee,” Mr. Schumer said. “When the bill gets through committee, it will be battle-tested and we will be prepared for the floor in a better way.”The group is also considering again trying to maintain a large voting bloc, to squash any amendments they believe could kill their bill.“I think we have to unless there’s something that we both agree to,” Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said when asked about such a possibility at an immigration panel on Wednesday. “It’s going to be fragile, as these kinds of things are, and so we will have to take some tough votes in order to keep it intact.”Finally, even business and labor interests — who historically come down on opposite sides of how to handle the future flow of legal immigrants — are currently working among themselves and with the Senate in an attempt to reach a compromise.“We have had discussions with both labor — the A.F.L.-C.I.O., the S.E.I.U. — and business,” including with Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and leaders of other groups, Mr. Schumer said Monday.“And in fact while we’ve been negotiating these principles, they’ve been sitting talking to one another,” he added. “They are making really good progress, much better than in 2009.”Mr. Lott said that the collapse of an immigration overhaul in 2007 was “one of the most embarrassing moments that I experienced in the Senate,” and that the memories were still vivid — the way conservative talk radio turned on him, the angry phone calls flooding his office from around the country every morning, the handful of death threats.Watching the immigration debate take shape now, he said, he is heartened to watch Mr. Rubio and others aggressively make their case in the press — something he wishes he had done better six years ago.“I’d been in the Congress 34 years by then — I should have known better,” Mr. Lott said. “I was just trying to help move this thing along, but I should have paid better attention to the message part of it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/world/asia/xu-liangying-92-scientist-and-democracy-advocate.html,"Xu Liangying, a scientist and an advocate of democracy in China who was renowned for translating the works of Albert Einstein while banished to the countryside for denouncing Mao Zedong’s purge of intellectuals, died on Monday in Beijing. He was 92.His son Xu Chenggang confirmed the death.In a life that spanned many of the convulsions of 20th-century China, Mr. Xu evolved from an ardent supporter of the Communist Party into an outspoken critic of the government, giving heart to the pro-democracy demonstrations of 1989 before they were crushed by the military. Threading through that life was his conviction that science, exemplified by Einstein’s achievements, offered China a beacon of reason.“Superstition is the great enemy of truth,” he told a Chinese magazine, Caijing, last year. “We must use science and democracy to eradicate modern superstitions of every kind, to eradicate superstitions that are born of loyalty.”Xu Liangying was born in the eastern Chinese province of Zhejiang on May 3, 1920. He entered Zhejiang University in 1939, determined, he wrote on his entrance form, to become an “authority of modern physics.” As a high school student he had read “The World as I See It,” a collection of Einstein’s essays.Mr. Xu’s studies were disrupted by the invading Japanese Army, which forced his school to shift from place to place and exposed him to the brute disparities of rural life. Deciding that “total revolution” was needed to transform China, he became a student organizer and joined the Communist Party underground.After the party came to power in 1949, Mr. Xu’s background as a scientist who had served the revolution won him promotion to the Chinese Academy of Sciences in Beijing.For a time, he served as a censor in the academy, assigned to scour research papers for any unacceptable views and delicate information. He later spoke proudly of having allowed many papers to be sent abroad for publication, his son said.But in 1957, the candor that Mr. Xu prized in science brought his downfall. That year, in the “Hundred Flowers” campaign, Mao urged citizens, especially intellectuals, to speak out and expose the party’s failings. But when the response was an outpouring of criticism, Mao condemned his critics as “Rightists.”Mr. Xu, dismayed by Mao’s reversal, spoke up in defense of the “Hundred Flowers.” He was dismissed from his job, expelled from the Communist Party and condemned as an “ultra-Rightist.”In 1958, facing imprisonment in a “re-education” labor camp, Mr. Xu persuaded officials to banish him to his home village. He spent most of the next two decades there working as a farmer. In a ruse so that his wife, Wang Laidi, and their two sons could stay in Beijing, the couple divorced, but later remarried.He began translating Einstein’s works in 1962, relying on friends to send books borrowed from libraries in Beijing, said Danian Hu, a former student of Mr. Xu’s who teaches history at the City College of New York.But in Mao’s era, not even the abstractions of physics were immune from ideological upheaval. During the Cultural Revolution, radicals from Shanghai showed up at the camp and seized a manuscript of Mr. Xu’s translations of Einstein to use in their campaign to condemn relativity and other findings of what they called “bourgeois science.”Mao’s death in 1976 ended decades of radical convulsions and gave rise to the reformer Deng Xiaoping, who vowed that science and technology would be at the heart of economic modernization. Tens of thousands of banished scientists and intellectuals, including Mr. Xu, returned from the countryside. He got back his job at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, regained his party membership and published his three-volume collection of Einstein’s works.Mr. Xu believed, however, that China needed more than the practical applications of science. He and his friend Fang Lizhi, an astrophysicist-turned-dissident who died in April, became prominent voices arguing that true progress would elude China unless it embraced intellectual “enlightenment” and ultimately full-fledged democracy. By the late 1980s, Mr. Xu told The New York Times in 2006, “I gave up Marxism totally and returned to Einstein.”By 1989 he was a “spiritual figurehead for many of the students” who led the pro-democracy protests centered on Tiananmen Square, said Mr. Hu, the historian. Mr. Xu, who was not directly involved in the demonstrations, was outraged but not entirely surprised when Deng used tanks and armed soldiers to crush the protests, his son Xu Chenggang said.“He understood very well the nature of this government,” he added.Again shunned by the party, Mr. Xu lived nearly a decade under police watch in his book-filled apartment in Beijing’s university district. But in his last years he remained a mentor to young people seeking democratic change, said Hu Jia, a Beijing dissident and friend of Mr. Xu’s.Mr. Xu’s wife, Ms. Wang, a historian, died on Dec. 31.Besides his son Xu Chenggang, survivors include another son, Xu Ping; a brother, Xu Liangrong; and a granddaughter.Mr. Xu was awarded the Andrei Sakharov Prize by the American Physical Society in 2008 for a “lifetime’s advocacy of truth, democracy and human rights.” His highest formal academic degree was his bachelor’s degree in science."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/nyregion/new-york-developers-and-unions-seek-eased-limits-on-midtown-projects.html,"In recent years, the real estate industry has clashed repeatedly with unions in New York City over wages, work rules and its favorite development projects.But now, prominent developers have forged an unusual alliance with labor and the construction industry to lobby for rules to allow a new crop of skyscrapers around Grand Central Terminal in Midtown.They are seeking to go further than the Bloomberg administration, which has proposed zoning changes that would enable developers to build office towers in some cases twice the size currently permitted. The new alliance is pressing the administration to loosen its proposed rules so that more skyscrapers can be built on more sites, at a quicker pace and at a lower cost.Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg has said the densely built-up neighborhood’s position as the city’s premier office district has been undermined by zoning rules that curtail the height of buildings and discourage placing new towers where the average age of buildings now is 73 years.Community boards, preservationists, elected officials and the Municipal Art Society have urged the city to slow down and do a rigorous assessment of the impact of more tall buildings on an already congested area. They say they fear that the proposal could lead to the demolition of historic buildings to make way for towers that would cast shadows over landmarks, like the Waldorf-Astoria and the MetLife Building.In a letter dated Jan. 25 to Deputy Mayor Robert K. Steel, who is leading the rezoning effort, the alliance — called Midtown 21C: Coalition for a Globally Competitive NYC — vowed to “aggressively advocate for the passage of a rezoning plan for Midtown East, along with the proposed improvements to the plan that we have suggested.”The letter was signed by officials from the Real Estate Board of New York, the powerful lobbying arm of the industry; the New York Building Congress; the Building Trades Employers Association; the Manhattan Chamber of Commerce; and three labor organizations: Local 32BJ Service Employees International Union, the Building and Construction Trades Council of New York and the Hotel Trades Council.No one involved in the debate disputes there is a need for modern office towers in the 70-block area around Grand Central. The discussion has been over the best way to encourage development and how to pay for the improvements to streets, sidewalks and transit links that then would be necessary.After meeting with real estate executives, the city’s Planning Department unveiled proposed zoning changes last year and hopes to have them approved by the City Council in October. It is trying to complete the rezoning in less than half the time spent on the Hudson Yards rezoning on the West Side, which was adopted in 2005 after five years’ work, or the Hudson Square rezoning downtown, which is in its fifth year.The administration’s plan would allow developers, under certain conditions, to build taller, more efficient office towers. Developers would be able to buy development rights for the towers from the city and later from the owner of the development rights over Grand Central.Planning Department officials have played down the impact, saying the new towers would go up over a long period of time and add only four million square feet of space and 16,000 employees to a neighborhood with 230,000 office workers.At a breakfast forum on Tuesday sponsored by Crain’s New York Business, City Councilman Daniel Garodnick, a Democrat who represents the district, said the city was on the right track. But, he added, new office space is only part of the equation. There is a need for $400 million worth of improvements to Grand Central today, he said, let alone when new towers are put up nearby.The city’s plans to raise money for those improvements are uncertain, he said. And there may not be enough time before October to calculate the full effect of the zoning changes.“Pace is an issue for us,” Mr. Garodnick said. “The Council is not going to get boxed in here.”Nervous that the Council could scuttle the proposal and eager to make changes to the city’s plan, the real estate industry decided to build a united front with unions representing construction, building maintenance and hotel workers. Real estate executives credit Rob Speyer, a developer and the new chairman of the Real Estate Board, with the new strategy.“Business and labor have a lot of common interests,” Mr. Speyer said. “We want to focus on our common ground. We’re sending a strong message to elected officials that labor and business are united on a given issue.”Mr. Speyer and Hector Figueroa, president of Local 32BJ, plan to interview prospective mayoral candidates jointly in the coming months about economic development, job creation, affordable housing and overhauling immigration policy. Thirteen months ago, the union and real estate owners were engaged in contentious contract negotiations.“Both industry and unions have political clout for different reasons,” Mr. Figueroa said. “To the extent we can identify issues that we can agree on, so much the better.”But he cautioned that the two sides “may not end up endorsing the same candidates.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/us/politics/in-hidebound-senate-decorum-becomes-less-traditional.html,"WASHINGTON — If Senator John McCain had an inkling of curiosity how his old buddy Chuck Hagel felt as the senator raked him over the confirmation coals on Thursday, Mr. McCain would get a slight taste an hour later during his own rendezvous with rudeness.That is when Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky took to the Senate floor to deride Mr. McCain’s opposition to his measure that would punish Egypt as “spurious and really, frankly, absurd,” not the first time Mr. Paul has wielded verbal scythes toward his colleagues.The willingness of Republicans to skewer one of their own became increasingly apparent on Friday as more and more members of the party peeled away from Mr. Hagel, President Obama’s nominee for secretary of defense, saying they would not vote to confirm him after Mr. Hagel melted like chocolate on a dashboard under combative questioning from Republicans.Still, Republican senators and aides said that despite a halting performance, Mr. Hagel would probably be confirmed with Democratic votes. A filibuster of his nomination is still possible, a likely first for a cabinet nominee. Aides to Senators John Cornyn of Texas, the No. 2 Republican, and Ted Cruz, a Texas newcomer, said Friday that they had not ruled out procedural roadblocks to stop Mr. Hagel’s nomination.But Republican Senate aides say Democrats would probably be able to muster 60 votes to move to a final, up-or-down tally.“For a cabinet office, I think 51 votes is generally considered the right standard for the Senate to set, and at that level, I think he makes it,” Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, a member of the Republican leadership, said Friday on Fox News, even as he announced his opposition to Mr. Hagel.The White House shared that view.“I would be stunned if, in the end, Republican senators chose to try to block the nomination of a decorated war veteran who was once among their colleagues in the Senate as a Republican,” said Jay Carney, the White House press secretary.Privately, White House officials agreed that Mr. Hagel came across poorly. “No one would argue that he had a good performance,” said one official, who declined to be named to be more candid.Mr. Hagel has long been on the outs with some party mates because of policy disagreements with them over the years, which sometimes made him seem more like a Democrat. But stemming from their Senate ranks as he did, the intensity of their grilling was striking and illustrative of how the old ways of the Senate are disappearing.With the current era of hyperpartisanship in Washington, the intra-Senate discord has reached new levels in the usually approbatory chamber in recent months, a place where a certain level of respect for fellow and retired members of the same party is generally more or less a given.The easy, celebratory hearing afforded Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts on his way to confirmation as secretary of state was much more in keeping with Senate tradition than the smackdown delivered to Mr. Hagel, though his own search for answers did him no favors. The clubbiness of the Senate was what made the 1989 rejection of former Senator John Tower, Republican of Texas, for secretary of defense astonishing even with multiple tales of personal problems.But Senate Republicans, in particular, who have added more conservative members to their ranks in the last two years, and who fear the constant and imminent threat of primary challengers from the right, have loosened their grip of late on the bonds that distinguish the Senate from any other legislative body.In December, Bob Dole, the former majority leader, went to the Senate floor in a wheelchair to advocate for a disability treaty, and many of his Republican colleagues, including some who had praised the measure previously, waited for him to be wheeled away before turning the measure down. That would have been almost unthinkable in the past.“Part of the shift in the Republican Party,” said Don Ritchie, the Senate historian, “means that old-time senators like Dole who were to the right of their party when they came here are to the left of their party now because the party has shifted so much beneath them. This all reflects that a bit.”There were other moments as well. Earlier in the week, Senator David Vitter, Republican of Louisiana, took to talk radio to refer to a Republican colleague, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, as “amazingly naïve” for his proposals to overhaul the nation’s immigration system. Mr. Rubio did not choose to respond or question the judgment of Mr. Vitter, whose phone number once appeared in a client list of a Washington madam.History both predicted and, in some ways, diffused discord in the Senate. Thomas Jefferson, who “realized every issue was going to be difficult and emotional,” Mr. Ritchie said, wrote the first rules manual in the 1790s in which members were instructed not to call one another by name, but rather the “distinguished senator from state of X or Y,” and to address one another through the chairman and not directly.Members are not supposed to question one another’s motives or criticize individual states. Duels have been fought over language on the floor. Before the floor activities were televised, senators quietly removed cutting words from the Congressional Record, as when one member called another a “rancid tub of ignorance” on the Senate floor in the 1950s.But many Senate Republicans now are newly elected, deeply conservative members who have less regard for the old rules of comity and respect for elders.“The Republicans in the Senate have moved decidedly to the right,” said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, who recently said he would not seek re-election. “A lot of them are kind of fearful of what the Tea Party might do to them.”This is something that appeared to not be lost on Mr. Cornyn, who, up for re-election next year, was one of just three senators, all Republicans, to vote against Mr. Kerry. Mr. Cornyn appears to be mapping the voting path of his new colleague from Texas, Mr. Cruz, a Tea Party star.At the center of this is Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader who could draw a primary challenge of his own next year, and who has generally maintained steady politesse even when thrashing Democrats on the floor. Mr. McConnell and Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, had enjoyed years of cordial and even friendly relations, but their interactions are largely limited to talk of baseball now because the Senate floor has become a place of such disharmony.Mr. Hagel’s hearing, his perceived subpar performance notwithstanding, still set some members on edge. Senator Claire McCaskill, Democrat of Missouri, used introductory remarks seemingly to make that point. “In my six years on this committee,” she said, “the defense of this country is a bipartisan effort.”Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, told Mr. Hagel he felt the need to “apologize for some of the tone and demeanor today.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/us/seeing-darwin-through-christians-eyes.html,"On Jan. 22, Rush D. Holt, a Democrat who represents central New Jersey’s 12th Congressional District, introduced a resolution designating Feb. 12, 2013 — Charles Darwin’s 204th birthday — as Darwin Day, “recognizing the importance of science in the betterment of humanity.”Perhaps a day in honor of Darwin would help the cause of science, if only a little.“I hope we can hold hearings,” Mr. Holt said, “where people can hear about Darwin and science and the jobs it creates, the lives it saves, everything.”Mr. Holt, a nuclear physicist by training, would probably not have the support of his colleague Paul Broun, a Republican from Georgia’s 10th Congressional District. Representative Broun, a doctor, is famous among science lovers for having told the Liberty Baptist Church Sportsman’s Banquet last fall that “all that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang theory, all that is lies, straight from the pit of hell.”Evolution, he added, is one of those “lies to try to keep me and all the folks who were taught that from understanding that they need a savior.”Two congressmen, two Christians and two very different views of the man who in 1859 published “On the Origin of Species.” A century and a half after the publication of the book that changed our understanding of the living world, “this amazingly creative man,” as Mr. Holt called Darwin in an interview this week, still gets a whupping from politicians trying to scare up the votes of conservative Christians.On Tuesday night, Mr. Broun’s wife told a room of surprised onlookers that her husband would be running for the Senate in 2014.Mr. Holt says he is a Christian whose spiritual home is the Quaker meeting in Princeton, N.J. Mr. Broun, whose spokeswoman said he was expected to make an announcement about his possible candidacy in the next week, attends a Baptist church in Athens, Ga., and is a member of the Gideons, the group that places Bibles in hotel rooms.Many Christians, of course, believe that Darwin’s theory of evolution by natural selection is compatible with a Christian worldview. The Roman Catholic Church, for example, is comfortable with Darwin, especially as his work relates to the evolution of bodies (souls come from God). In 1996, Pope John Paul II wrote, confirming older Catholic teaching, that “there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith.”Ronald L. Numbers, a science historian at the University of Wisconsin, said that many evangelical Protestants were once willing to accept the theory, as long as it was applied only to animals, not to humans.For example, the Tennessee law that gave rise to the famous Scopes trial, in 1925, “banned the teaching of human evolution, not the teaching of evolution,” Mr. Numbers said.“And the reason was that most people were concerned about its ethical teaching,” he added. “If you read the first chapter of Genesis, it’s very clear humans were created perfect, then they sinned, then degeneration set in. Whereas evolutionists of any stripe believed humans had progressed over millennia or longer.”Non-Christians, too, worried about the way Darwin’s teachings could be twisted.“Exposés coming out of World War I indicated that the German high command had been influenced by Darwinism,” Mr. Numbers said. The Germans interpreted it as “the idea that might makes right, that only the strongest will survive,” he said.As time went on, Darwin was blamed for all sorts of moral decay. In the trial of Leopold and Loeb, two University of Chicago students who murdered a 14-year-old boy in 1924, he said, “there was the argument they had killed little Bobby Franks in cold blood because they had imbibed Darwinism and lost any respect for human life.”The argument was hinted at by Clarence Darrow, their defense lawyer, who went on to defend John T. Scopes on charges that he had taught human evolution in Tennessee. Darrow specifically mentioned the pernicious influence of reading Nietzsche, but others saw Darwin’s malignant hand at work.In the 1960s, as Americans, racing the Russians to the moon, embraced science, fears of Darwin were calmed a bit. But as Chris Mooney, the author of “The Republican War on Science,” points out, the 1970s, a time of rising power for evangelicals, also saw a resurgence in Darwinism as a code word for all that they loathed.“Evolution is connected to the culture of Roe v. Wade,” Mr. Mooney said, referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized most abortions. “You take down humans’ sense of selves as something created, therefore you lower and debase them, and they act like beasts and do all these immoral things. Then you get teen pregnancy and out-of-wedlock pregnancies, et cetera.”Today, Darwin’s name energizes not only Christians but skeptics.Edwina Rogers, executive director of the Secular Coalition for America, said that when her coalition polled more than 1,800 of its supporters, “education issues,” a topic that includes creationism and anti-Darwinism in public schools, were their top concern.“This is what they care about more than anything,” Ms. Rogers said. “They want their kids to be able to go out in the world and get jobs based on scientific knowledge.”I asked Mr. Holt if he had talked with Mr. Broun about his proposal for a day devoted to Darwin.“I haven’t,” Mr. Holt said. “I probably should have. Now that you say that, I’ll go talk to him. But if we had dinner, I suspect there’d be a lot of things that would be more fun for us to talk about than Darwin.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/opinion/his-honor-mr-koch.html,"It is hard to imagine New York City without Edward Koch impressing himself on its every facet, demanding, in his trademark imperiousness, to be saluted by one and all. His death Friday at the age of 88 is a moment of unalloyed sadness in the city’s history. For while Mr. Koch had a decidedly mixed record of City Hall management through some of the best and worst of times, he made an über-career of distilling and billboarding the city’s essence as he saw it, usually with himself at the center of things.As mayor from 1978 to 1989, Mr. Koch enthusiastically helped the state right the city’s fiscal keel after the city’s calamitous brush with bankruptcy. He used a growing budget to restore city services and jobs. He endorsed public campaign financing. While dismissing rivals’ insinuations about his bachelor status (“nobody’s business but mine,” he said), he ordered an end to sexual discrimination in city jobs. Mr. Koch initiated a $5 billion housing renovation plan in 1986 that greatly enlarged the housing pool for the working poor and repaired the Bronx’s image as a hopeless case of urban blight.But by his third term, Mr. Koch found himself wearing down at the center of a skein of City Hall corruption involving assorted commissioners. The fact that he was not personally part of the schemers’ municipal greed only underlined his growing disconnection from effective management. The one-time slayer of the Tammany Tiger had grown too close to machine politicians.All the while he delighted in dressing down his critics in bursts of Kochisms punctuated by his impish grin. He insulted rivals on the political stage as a strategy that paid off in support in all the boroughs from voters who savored his cheekiness. “You punch me, I punch back,” he fairly bragged. His liberal political persona waxed conservative across time for different constituencies, and his aggressiveness repeatedly roiled race relations.Through all this, Mr. Koch remained unsparing in his obsessive affection for the city, fashioning his role as the M.C. of Gotham’s nonstop dance marathon. He became the ultimate gadabout in retirement, spouting sound bites for any available outlet. He kept up on major issues, intruding if he had to with his opinions on the latest races. To his credit, he never lost his belief in the power of politics. He even fashioned a statewide foray for himself at the age of 85 to denounce politicians who broke their promise to reform Albany’s dysfunction. “Throw the bums out!” Mr. Koch cried, joyful on the hustings.It was in 1977, as a successful but deeply homesick fifth-term congressman, that Mr. Koch took a long-shot jump into a packed primary field of Democratic mayoral aspirants. His simple strategy was to be “unbelievably outspoken” before the voters. “I have to break out of the pack of candidates and get the people to know me as I am,” was his conclusion.He turned out to accomplish that mission with prodigious élan during his City Hall years and well beyond. “I don’t want to leave Manhattan, even when I’m gone,” Mr. Koch said in choosing his grave at Trinity Cemetery, where memorably ambitious New Yorkers finally come to rest."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/opinion/global/memo-to-washington-foreign-policy-begins-abroad.html,"LondonJOHN Kerry’s overwhelming confirmation as the next U.S. secretary of state presents a welcome opportunity to consider what the point of the job is. Now that Hillary Clinton has left Foggy Bottom for a well-earned rest, it’s worth stating that public diplomacy — even of the remarkably successful kind that she embodied — was not Thomas Jefferson’s idea of being the country’s chief diplomat, nor, one suspects, Clinton’s.An extraordinarily able and shrewd politician with an unmatched global Rolodex, Clinton accepted early on a circumscribed definition of the role for reasons that probably only she truly knows. For the United States, and the world, however, it has left a legacy of diplomatic detachment from a range of conflicts and challenges that require more than occasional presidential rhetoric and judicious reserve about the use of military force.Looking back, it is clear that the role of secretary of state in the Obama administration was constructed around primarily domestic priorities: first, managing successfully the poisonous political rivalry between the two giants of the Democratic Party; second, reassuring the American public that the “era of wars” was indeed coming to an end; and third, that when America would project its power and influence to neutralize national security threats, it would be far more in the form of drones and special forces than diplomats.The great promise of a president uniquely prepared by heritage, intellect and experience to guide America’s 21st century global mission with a global perspective gave way to a largely reluctant, conventional — and highly militarized — form of engagement with the world.Underlying these political motivations was the deeply held belief that in the aftermath of the Great Recession the country’s global position was defined entirely by its economic strength. “Foreign policy begins at home” became a mantra as familiar in the era of economic crisis as “Yes, we can” was during the 2008 campaign.Generals were quoted approvingly stating that the greatest threat to U.S. national security was the budget deficit. Bank bailouts, debt-ceilings and fiscal cliffs consumed not only the attention and energy of the White House — for electoral as much as national reasons — but defined sharply down the priority of new foreign policy initiatives (beyond, that is, the vastly expanded secret campaign of targeted assassinations of suspected Al Qaeda terrorists).What this legacy bequeaths to Kerry are two false choices that he must confront without alienating that same White House from which he will ultimately derive his influence. First, it is time to recognize that foreign policy begins just as often, and just as importantly, abroad. To be sure, from the earliest days of the Republic through World War II it has been understood that America’s global influence is built on its ability to back words with resources, and diplomacy with arms, investments and trade agreements.Even so, Chinese nationalism, terrorism in the Sahel, a savage civil war in Syria, climate change, cyberwarfare, the Iranian nuclear program and the E.U. crisis are challenges with distinct roots and reasons far beyond the shores of America. They need to be encountered and understood out there — through patient, strategic and often uncomfortable negotiations that recognize the value of listening as much as talking.Otherwise, the risk of surprise on the scale of the one that struck on that cloudless day in New York a decade ago will remain — and indeed increase — in a fragmenting, rapidly changing world.Second, Kerry must mount a new challenge to Washington’s ossified debate about intervention as an instrument of foreign policy. Syria will soon present him with the best (or worst, as the case may turn out) reason to do so. For the president’s critics, the U.S. should have taken a much more active, military, role far sooner — including arming the opposition, imposing a no-flight zone and conducting targeted strikes against the regime.President Obama in an interview with The New Republic this week elaborated on why all of these options seem to him deeply unpalatable — dwelling on everything from the risk of triggering the use of chemical weapons, to the impact on operations in Afghanistan, to the relative merits of acting in Syria vs. acting in the Congo in order to save lives.Of course, the fact that there isn’t a simple military solution to the Syria crisis is precisely what makes a dramatic and sustained diplomatic initiative so urgent — and its absence so troubling (and the same argument can be made in relation to the Iranian nuclear challenge). One need have no illusions about the Russian or Chinese views of the crisis to appreciate that without a genuine negotiation where they will have to get in order to give, the slaughter will continue — and risks of regional escalation spike.But such has been the near-complete militarization of U.S. foreign policy over the past decade that for all intents and purposes the only alternative presented to an invasion of the country is a combination of drone strikes and targeted killings. The tried and tested principle of diplomacy backed by the threat of force has seen a near-total inversion. Axiomatic now as the only alternative to doing nothing is the use of lethal force backed by the occasional choice of diplomacy as clean-up job.This is unworthy of a great power — and a great foreign service. During his confirmation hearings, Kerry stated that “American foreign policy is not defined by drones and deployments alone.” If that remark is to be remembered as more than one man’s expression of hope over experience, he will have to make it so.To engage, to cajole, to give and take, to offer incentives to allies and enemies alike in pursuit of interests global and national, political and economic, to wield diplomatic power and influence as only America can: That is Kerry’s opportunity now — and his challenge. Nader Mousavizadeh is chief executive of Oxford Analytica and the co-author, with Kofi Annan, of “Interventions: A Life in War and Peace.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/world/europe/another-reset-of-relations-with-russia-in-obamas-second-term.html,"MOSCOW — Four years ago, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. used an audience of world leaders at an annual security conference in Munich to propose a “reset” with Russia, the Obama administration’s first big foreign policy statement. But as Mr. Biden arrives in Germany for the same conference this weekend, the United States is quietly adopting a new approach to its old cold war rival: the cold shoulder.The intense engagement on the reset led to notable achievements, including the New Start nuclear arms treaty and Russia’s entry into the World Trade Organization. But after more than a year of deteriorating relations, the administration now envisions a period of disengagement, according to government officials and outside analysts here and in Washington.The pullback — which may well be a topic of discussion when Mr. Biden meets with the Russian foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, on the sidelines of the conference — is a response to months of intensifying political repression in Russia since Vladimir V. Putin returned to the presidency last May and a number of actions perceived by Washington as anti-American.Because American officials do not want to worsen the relationship and still hope for cooperation, they declined to publicly describe the plans. But within the administration it is taken for granted that the relationship with Russia is far less of a priority.“We have real differences, and we don’t hide them,” said Tony Blinken, who has served as Mr. Biden’s national security adviser and is now joining the president’s national security team.Briefing reporters before the Germany trip, Mr. Blinken said: “We have differences over human rights and democracy. We have differences over — in a number of areas that have been in the media in recent days and weeks.”The distancing began with the recent withdrawal by the United States from the “civil society working group,” one of 20 panels created in 2009 to carry out the reset between Moscow and Washington under an umbrella organization known as the Obama-Medvedev Commission.If that step was barely perceptible outside diplomatic circles, the strategy will soon become far more obvious. American officials say President Obama will decline an invitation — publicly trumpeted by Mr. Lavrov and the Russian news media — to visit Moscow on his own this spring. Instead, he will wait until September, when the G-20 conference of the world’s largest economies is scheduled to take place in St. Petersburg, Russia.And while Secretary of State John Kerry has yet to select his first overseas destination, officials said Russia had been ruled out.The main goal seems to be to send a message that the United States views much of its relationship with Russia as optional, and while pressing matters will continue to be handled on a transactional basis, Washington plans to continue criticizing Russia on human rights and other concerns. As for the anti-Americanism, the new approach might be described as shrug and snub.Nevertheless, Mr. Blinken said there was real potential to work through the differences. And American officials are clearly betting that Mr. Putin desires a prominent role on the world stage and will ultimately decide to re-engage.But the chances of that seem slim. Mr. Putin’s spokesman, Dmitri Peskov, warned that a pullback would be a shirking of American responsibility to work with Russia to maintain global stability. He said that Russia wanted to improve economic ties and build a stronger relationship, but that the United States must stay out of Russia’s affairs.“We have heard numerous times the word in Washington that Russia’s domestic affairs are not satisfactory,” Mr. Peskov said. “Unfortunately these voices cannot be taken into account here, and we cannot agree with them. We are a genuine democratic country, and we are taking care of ourselves.”In the nearly three years since the signing of the New Start treaty, followed by Russia’s vote two months later at the Security Council in support of sanctions on Iran, American officials say only one major thing has changed: the return of Mr. Putin to the presidency.Confronted by the emergence of a potent political opposition movement among Moscow’s urban middle class, Mr. Putin has taken steps since his inauguration last May to suppress political dissent. Many of those steps were also seen in Washington as anti-American and undermining human rights.These included the prosecution and jailing of members of the punk band Pussy Riot; the decision to end more than 20 years of cooperation on public health programs and civil society initiatives run by the United States Agency for International Development; cancellation of a partnership to dismantle unconventional weapons; and approval of legislative initiatives clamping down on pro-democracy groups and other nonprofit organizations.The final straw appeared to be a law signed by Mr. Putin in December prohibiting the adoption of Russian children by American citizens, which the Kremlin said was retaliation for a new American law punishing Russian human rights violators. Senior Obama administration officials viewed the adoption ban not only as geopolitically disproportionate, but so utterly cruel in denying orphans the chance to join a family that it left many speechless and some near tears.That the Russian government would put children in the political cross-fire convinced American officials that they were not confronting political theatrics, as they believed when Mr. Putin was running for re-election, but rather an increasingly idiosyncratic government driven by Russian domestic concerns, especially Mr. Putin’s fears of popular unrest.“It’s a feeling of frustration that Putin and company are unnecessarily imposing strains on the Russian and American relationship,” Zbigniew Brzezinski, a former national security adviser, now a trustee of the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said in a telephone interview.“I would not construe that as saying that Russia needs to be downgraded, or is irrelevant,” Mr. Brzezinski said, but that “we do not need it for everything.”Even Russia’s most critical role in the global economy, as a major supplier of oil and gas — particularly to American allies in Europe — has ebbed, given the rise of the United States as a major producer of shale gas and the return of Iraq as a big oil producer.At the same time, outside its borders, Russia remains indisputably relevant on a range of global issues, including the threats and opportunities from climate change in the Arctic and the political uncertainty in North Korea, that prevent the United States from pulling back too far.“We can manage these issues effectively together, or end up shouting at each other,” said James F. Collins, who was ambassador to Russia from 1997 to 2001 under President Bill Clinton. “Anybody who suggests we are going to disengage and let them stew just doesn’t get it. We will have to deal with them.”Matthew Bryza, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for Eurasian affairs, said it would be best to deal dispassionately with Moscow.“Every American president in my career has come into office thinking that they are going to be the great communicator that makes a breakthrough with Russia,” Mr. Bryza said. “As their terms have continued, every president has been disappointed.”He added: “Russia behaves like Russia. Russia pursues its own hard-core national interests. That is realpolitik. We should de-sentimentalize our relations.”"

Mr. Airikyan was shot in the shoulder by an unknown assailant but is expected to make a full recovery. Investigators offered no immediate motive for the attack. He spent years in Soviet prisons for promoting Armenian independence and was stripped of his citizenship and expelled to Ethiopia in 1988. He lived in Los Angeles before returning to Armenia after the fall of the Soviet Union. He has run for president several times but never won more than a small share of the vote.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/world/africa/hollande-to-visit-french-troops-in-mali.html,"MUNICH — President François Hollande of France was on his way to Mali on Friday evening to thank French soldiers, to underline the need for a political solution to Mali’s divisions and to emphasize to French voters his resolute and so-far successful intervention in the former French colony.Mr. Hollande, who was often criticized in the past for his lack of decisiveness, has gotten a small bump in opinion polls after moving quickly to send the French military to the aid of a weak, transitional government in Mali that seemed in imminent danger of falling to a coalition of radical Islamists equipped with weaponry taken from Libya.While the French have rapidly driven the radical Islamists out of population centers in the north, with the loss of only one French helicopter pilot, Mr. Hollande’s aides are conscious of the risks of overstaying and becoming targets themselves.The French strategy has been to push the radicals back into the deserts and hills of the far north, where they can be monitored by drones and attacked by air. The French expect that the radicals will have a harder time stocking up on gasoline and food, especially if Algeria, as promised, seals its border with Mali, making it more difficult for the Islamist militants to plan further raids and kidnappings of Westerners.But no French official interviewed in Paris believes that the radical Islamists have disappeared.The French are pressing for African troops to garrison the cities of northern Mali before the rains come in March, and they are pressing President Dioncounda Traoré of Mali to start negotiations quickly with Tuareg rebels in the north, most of whom do not share the radical Islamist view. The majority of Tuaregs, the French say, will agree to remain in a sovereign Mali with more guarantees of political autonomy, and the French hope that a deal would lead to early national elections.The French Foreign Finistry has called on the Mali government in the capital city of Bamako to open talks with “legitimate representatives” and “nonterrorist armed groups” in the north, a clear reference to the more secular Tuareg National Movement for the Liberation of Azawad, known as the MNLA.Bamako has said it is open to talks with the MNLA, which has dissociated itself from the radical Islamists, so long as it gives up its demand for full Tuareg independence. But the government has ruled out talks with the radical Islamist groups, including Ansar Dine, one of the leading militant organizations.Paris also wants to see the presence of up to 5,000 United Nations peacekeeping troops, officials say, to underline the international support for an integral Mali and further dilute the French presence.French officials are also concerned, at least in private, about charges that the regular Malian army has been guilty of human rights abuses and killings of Tuareg and Arab civilians and former fighters. Human rights organizations, including Human Rights Watch and the Paris-based International Federation for Human Rights, have cited evidence of summary executions by the Malian army as it has moved north with the French.The radical Islamists who controlled the north for 10 months have been accused of similar abuses, including murder and the rough application of Shariah law — the stoning of adulterous women and the cutting off of the hands of thieves. But the French recognize that they bear some responsibility for the behavior of their allies, the Malian government and its army.Mr. Hollande will emphasize all these points to Mr. Traoré, French officials said. Mr. Hollande will be accompanied by his top national security team, including Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian and Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius, as well as the deputy minister for development in the Foreign Ministry, Pascal Canfin The French officials are expected to meet Mr. Traoré in the central town of Sévaré, then travel with him to picturesque Timbuktu to meet with the French and Malian forces stationed there, and perhaps to view the damage done to historical and religious sites by the radical Islamists. Mr. Hollande is scheduled to return to France on Saturday evening.The French dilemma in this second phase was summarized neatly by Vincent Giret in the newspaper Libération. If the French remain on the front line they will look, “sooner or later, like white neocolonialists,” he wrote, and any bad event can turn public opinion quickly sour. But if the French army “settles for a role supporting the Malian and African troops left on the front line, it then risks being accused of covering up abuses and score-settlings: the spirit of vengeance is already creeping into the liberated cities of the north.”However decisive the first military phase has been, Mr. Giret wrote, “there is no military solution to the Malian crisis — politics must take over in short order.” France must not only work to rebuild the broken state of Mali, but also press Malian leaders to find an answer to “the ‘Tuareg question,’ a necessary condition for isolating the terrorists.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/opinion/ed-koch-the-king-of-new-york.html,"NEW HAVENI WAS almost scripted to hate Ed Koch from the moment in September 1977 when I moved, with a new Harvard doctorate, to Brooklyn, on what would become a long activist-writer’s foray into the city’s fiscal crisis and the effects of that summer’s power blackout and looting.Mr. Koch was winning the Democratic mayoral primary, and my cousin James Wechsler, who’d been the editor of The New York Post in its liberal glory days but was then in charge of just the editorial page, was shaking his head in a lonely corner office on South Street as The Post’s new proprietor, Rupert Murdoch, turned it into a virtual press office for the Koch campaign.Throughout his 12 years as mayor I assailed Mr. Koch — in a Brooklyn newspaper that I edited, in Dissent, in The Village Voice and even while working across the hall from him as a speechwriter for the City Council president, Carol Bellamy, whom the mayor at one point denominated, with his customary grace, “a horror show.”Somehow, 20 years after his first mayoral victory, I’d become an occasional Saturday lunch partner for Mr. Koch. As I listened to him hold court, I felt a bit like the man who reflects, “When I was 20, I couldn’t believe how stupid my father was; now that I’m 40, I’m impressed by how much he’s learned in those 20 years.”I don’t mean that Ed Koch was right about the fiscal and racial challenges he confronted — I think he was often clueless and wrong — but that even when wrong, he was brave and earnest in ways I hadn’t at first comprehended.One of his most emblematic, contradictory comments came in a Brooklyn “town meeting” in the early 1980s, where I watched him field questions from politically conservative, white ethnic and Jewish constituents. A man complained about new hiring standards to increase female and Hispanic representation in the police department: “Mr. Koch, why do you lower the height requirements just to include them? We need policemen who are big and tall and command respect.”The speaker was barely finished before the mayor raised his eyebrows in mock astonishment. “Have you ever seen a 5-foot-4 Puerto Rican with a gun?” The audience roared; his aides winced. Happily for them, no big media were present, sparing liberal New Yorkers the spectacle of a mayor using racism to defend affirmative action.On such paradoxes was Ed Koch’s mayoralty built. By showing frightened “outer borough” ethnics that he shared their visceral understandings, he won their grudging acquiescence in what, despite his rhetoric, was a liberal and racially integrated administration.Unfortunately, too much of that rhetoric provided cover for aggressive austerity measures, steps that he had to take to save the city but didn’t have to embrace quite as exuberantly as he did.Yet one quintessentially “Koch” gesture along those lines impresses me more favorably in retrospect than it did at the time.As Mr. Koch rose to address the American Public Health Association at the New York Hilton in 1979, doctors and health care activists protesting the closing of municipal hospitals, including Harlem’s symbolically important Sydenham, chanted “Racist Koch, you can’t hide; we charge you with genocide!” Three stormed the stage, pelting him with eggs. As his face streamed with the goo, Mr. Koch, then 54 years old, wrestled one to the floor before security guards carried the man off.Mr. Koch then called on audience members to stand if they wanted the other hecklers removed. As three-quarters of them did, he shouted, in his familiar, high-pitched scream: “If you can’t get your way out of the ballot box, you’re not going to get it through force! This is not Iran!”It looked demagogic. But not so much now, with Tea Party heckling and assaults on public officials. I don’t doubt he’d have dealt similarly with them — all the more so because he recently admitted that closing Sydenham was one of his big mistakes.“You’ve come a long way,” Mr. Koch wrote me in 1994, after reading a column of mine. I wish I could say he’d come a long way, too. But his courage, candor, principle and almost wild love for New York didn’t trump the fears and enthusiasms that marred his judgment. One of his last public political acts, his successful appeal to Jewish voters in Queens to elect a Republican congressional candidate to send the Obama administration a message about its policies toward Israel, strengthened a House majority perverted by people who would assail him as furiously as leftist activists did in 1979.I can almost hear him saying, “Of course, I’d have wrestled them down, too!” His belligerence was his strength, but also his tragic flaw: he rallied a city in crisis, but he couldn’t redeem it — or himself."

Mr. Tracy won after spending about $2,200.That kind of investment may pay off. A survey by the American Student Government Association found that 71 percent of student leaders are compensated.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/world/africa/france-hollande-timbuktu-mali.html,"TIMBUKTU, Mali — France’s president, François Hollande, paid a triumphant visit to this ancient city on Saturday, receiving a rapturous welcome from thousands of people who gathered next to a 14th-century mosque to dance, play drums and chant “Vive la France!” The muezzin, whose singing calls residents to pray five times a day, wore a scarf in the colors of the French flag as he shouted, “Vive Hollande!”It had the trappings of a “mission accomplished” moment.But even as people outside the mud-and-wood mosque hailed the French leader as the city’s, and their country’s, savior, questions remain about what France has accomplished aside from chasing Islamic extremists from the cities and into their desert and mountain redoubts.“These Islamists, they have not been defeated,” said Moustapha Ben Essayouti, a member of one of the city’s most prominent families who lined up to greet Mr. Hollande here. “Hardly any of them have been killed. They have run into the desert and the mountains to hide.”Even Mr. Hollande, who praised French and Malian troops gathered here for accomplishing “an exceptional mission,” acknowledged that “the fight is not over.”Indeed, little is known about the fate of fighters who fled the cities that have been retaken in the lightning northward advance by French and Malian troops to clear Islamists who had taken over the north of the country in recent months. In interviews, residents of cities now abandoned by the Islamist rebels have said that the bulk of the fighters fled in the night long before the French arrived.Given the fighters’ deep familiarity of the vast, forbidding territory between this city and the borders of Algeria and Mauritania, many worry that the Islamist groups will simply regroup and come back to try again.“If France leaves, they will come back,” Mr. Essayouti said.The spidery network of Islamist militants in Mali numbered about 2,000 hard-core fighters before the French airstrikes and march north, according to American intelligence officials, and there are no clear figures yet on how many died in the fighting. The most dangerous component of that mix is Al Qaeda’s affiliate in North Africa, known as Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, the officials said.The group has been attracting heavily armed Islamists from about 10 countries across North and West Africa, making Mali the biggest magnet for jihadi fighters other than Syria, one of the senior American intelligence officials said.The Islamists who advanced toward a pivotal frontier town on Jan. 10 — leading to worries of a possible march south to the capital and drawing France into the battle in the process — were well armed, with AK-47s, rocket-propelled grenades and heavy machine guns mounted on vehicles. They also had some armored personnel carriers seized from the Malian military last year.American military and counterterrorism officials applauded the speed and efficiency of the French-led operation, but they voiced concerns that the militants had ceded the northern cities with little or no resistance in order to prepare for a longer, bloodier insurgency.“Longer term, and the French know this, it’s going to take a while to root out all these cells and operatives,” Michael Sheehan, the Pentagon’s top special operations policy official, told a defense industry symposium on Wednesday.The senior United States intelligence official said that the real measure of success would be whether follow-up operations in the north would be able to diminish the strength of Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and other Islamist groups. Like other American officials, he spoke on the condition of anonymity because operations were continuing.Whether the Islamists are routed in the end may depend in part on how involved France remains. The Malian troops are considered to be poorly trained, and even the most capable of the other African troops pouring into the country as part of a regional force do not have the same level of weaponry to back them up as the French.Mr. Hollande refused to give a timetable on Saturday for the withdrawal of the 3,500 French troops currently in Mali. In a speech here he said that it is “not our role to stay,” but later in the capital of Bamako he said, “We will be with you to the end, all the way to northern Mali,” according to the French news media.In the past, French officials have talked about handing off the fight in the north to the Malian Army and other African troops.North Africa specialists and American intelligence officials say the militants might lay low until French forces leave.“Are they going to dig in and be guerrillas or go to ground and wait?” said Michael R. Shurkin, a former Central Intelligence Agency analyst who is now at the RAND Corporation.For now, the people of Timbuktu are grateful for France’s help. They waved French and Malian flags and sang to the thumping rhythms of djembe drums, which were banned under the harsh version of Shariah imposed by the Islamist group that took control of the city. Men and women danced side by side.As Mr. Hollande, ringed by security guards, plunged into the crowd to shake hands, some waved banners that said “Papa François, the mysterious city welcomes you.”“Hollande is our savior,” said Arkia Baby, a 24-year-old college student, who wore a purple batik dress of a style banned by the Islamists. “He gave us back our freedom.”That sentiment represents a strange twist in France’s often troubled history in Africa. France had a vast belt of colonies here that spanned the Sahara, from the Atlantic coast to just short of the Red Sea. After many of its colonies won independence in 1960, many remained bound to France, using a currency pegged to the franc and then the euro, and maintaining close trade, military and diplomatic ties.France’s role has been fraught with moral peril. It pioneered brutal techniques to put down insurgencies in the Algerian war for independence, carpet-bombing villages suspected of harboring nationalist guerrillas. In the early 1990s France staunchly supported the Hutu-dominated government of Rwanda, despite growing signs that a blood bath was in the making.More recently, French military intervention in Ivory Coast may have heightened ethnic tensions in that country. Even though the French intervened to install the country’s democratically elected leader, because the vote was cast along ethnic lines they were seen as favoring northerners and Muslims over southern Christians.The French lost only one helicopter pilot in Mali, but Mr. Hollande’s aides are conscious of the risks of overstaying and becoming targets themselves.The French hope that with the Islamists in far northern deserts and hills, they can be watched by drones and attacked from the air without harming civilians. The French also expect that the Islamists will have a harder time getting gasoline and food, especially if Algeria, as promised, seals its border with Mali. The French also say the Islamists will find it harder to plan further raids and kidnappings of Westerners that have helped finance their insurgency.Still, staying and fighting carries risks for France, beyond the safety of its troops. French officials have voiced concerns about charges that the regular Malian Army has been guilty of human rights abuses, including murders of Tuareg and Arab civilians they accuse of ties to the militants.Mr. Hollande warned the French and African troops here that they must avoid abuses, lest they “tarnish the mission.”Writing in the newspaper Libération, the French columnist Vincent Giret argued that the French face an unhappy choice in Mali. If they remain on the front line they will look, “sooner or later, like white neocolonialists,” and any bad episode can turn public opinion quickly sour. But if the French Army “settles for a role supporting the Malian and African troops left on the front line, it then risks being accused of covering up abuses and score settlings.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/technology/consumer-data-protection-laws-an-ocean-apart.html,"OVER the years, the United States and Europe have taken different approaches toward protecting people’s personal information. Now the two sides are struggling to bridge that divide.On this side of the Atlantic, Congress has enacted a patchwork quilt of privacy laws that separately limit the use of Americans’ medical records, credit reports, video rental records and so on. On the other side, the European Union has instituted more of a blanket regulatory system; it has a common directive that gives its citizens certain fundamental rights — like the right to obtain copies of records held about them by companies and institutions — that Americans now lack.Even so, United States officials maintain that the divergent approaches are equal. “The sum of the parts of U.S. privacy protection is equal to or greater than the single whole of Europe,” says Cameron F. Kerry, general counsel of the Commerce Department. He is overseeing an agency effort to help develop voluntary, enforceable codes of conduct for industry groups, like app developers, whose collection and use of consumer data are now unregulated.Europe begs to differ.“Yes, we share the basic idea of privacy,” says Peter Hustinx, Europe’s data protection supervisor. “But there is a huge deficit on the U.S. side.”Alas, the data-control divide appears to be widening.A year ago, the European Commission proposed comprehensive reforms to strengthen online privacy rights — changes that could have big repercussions for American technology companies and marketers that operate in the European Union. American officials, trade groups and tech executives have responded by taking frequent treks to Brussels and other cities, where they have urged regulators and legislators to reconsider the one-regulation-fits-all-data approach. What’s at stake, American industry representatives say, is nothing less than a free and commerce-friendly Internet.“The ecosystem of the Internet is very delicate,” says Kevin Richards, senior vice president of federal government affairs at TechAmerica, a trade group that represents companies like Google and Microsoft. “It’s not wise to have an overly broad, prescriptive, one-size-fits-all approach that would hinder or undermine the ability of companies to innovate in a global economy.”European Union members already have data protection laws in place, based on a directive from 1995 that laid out principles for the collection of personal information. The proposed new rules would strengthen some existing provisions. They would standardize data protections across the 27 member states. They would also provide some new rights, such as “data portability” — the right of consumers to easily transfer their text files, photographs and videos from one social network, or e-mail or cloud storage service, to another. And they would subject companies that violate the rules to penalties of up to 2 percent of their annual global revenue.Asked for comment, Viviane Reding, the vice president of the European Commission and the architect of the proposed regulation, said in a statement: “The main problem is that our rules predate the digital age and it became increasingly clear in recent years that they needed an update.” She continued: “That is why I have proposed a root-and-branch reform of the E.U.’s data protection rules — currently under discussion in the European Parliament and the Council of the E.U. — that will both protect citizens’ rights and facilitate business in the digital age.”BUT some provisions seem too rigid to United States officials and trade groups. They argue that the American approach — sector-specific privacy laws, in addition to industry self-regulation and enforcement by the Federal Trade Commission — is more nimble.“We hope that Europe will move in the direction of those multistakeholder standards, and not standards which are not flexible and don’t move at Internet speed,” says Mr. Kerry, who has taken at least four trips to European cities in the last year to discuss these issues.From the perspective of some European legislators, however, United States representatives seem more interested in protecting commerce than consumers. The full-court American effort may have backfired, they say, pushing some European officials toward even broader measures. Last month, Jan Philipp Albrecht, a representative of the European Parliament who reviewed the draft regulation, proposed additional rights for citizens — like the right not to be subject to consumer profiling.“My impression is that the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the Commerce Department are mostly just following the interests of Silicon Valley,” he says. “This leads to heavy pressure on the European regulator, I can say.”But Mr. Kerry says the United States must make its views known if the systems are to work in concert.“I know that some people have raised eyebrows at our involvement; I make no apologies,” Mr. Kerry says. “We in the United States and countries and businesses around the world are stakeholders in this process. This has an important impact on the global economy.”The solution to this trans-Atlantic clash may simply be American ingenuity.Last year, President Barack Obama proposed a “Consumer Privacy Bill of Rights” that would give Americans many of the same baseline protections that the draft European rule proposes to reinforce. These include the right of access to records that companies hold about them, the right to correct those records and the right to have limits on the personal data that companies collect and keep. Administration officials said they would work with Congress on legislation based on those rights and to extend oversight to industries not currently covered by federal privacy laws.A coalition of more than a dozen American advocacy groups said it would send a letter on Monday to senior Obama administration officials, seeking a meeting to ensure that American policy makers’ efforts in Europe “are not averse to the views expressed by the president.” The coalition includes the Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Center for Digital Democracy.“Does the Obama administration really want to be on the opposite side of the European effort to upgrade and modernize its privacy law which is at its core about the protection of a fundamental freedom?” asks Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.European officials hold out hope that Congress will enact baseline consumer privacy protections for Americans.“This development — which is much welcomed in Europe — shows that we have much in common,” Ms. Reding of the European Commission said in her statement, speaking of the privacy bill of rights. “Convergence is springing up and synergies are possible.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/kevin-l-james-a-long-shot-in-race-for-mayor-of-los-angeles.html,"LOS ANGELES — Kevin L. James, a conservative talk show host running for mayor of Los Angeles, was sitting in his campaign office recently pondering which was his bigger obstacle to victory: being openly Republican, or being openly gay.“Depending on what room you’re in here, sometimes it’s easier coming out gay to Republicans than it is coming out Republican to gays,” he said.By any measure, Mr. James, 49, is a bit of a long shot. He is a Republican brassy former prosecutor running in a Democratic city at a time when California is marching steadily to the left, making his first bid for office in a field of establishment candidates.Yet in the first major election since President Obama’s victory in November — voting that relegated the California Republican Party to the margins — Mr. James has become, at least for a few national Republicans, something of a lifeline. They see in his candidacy in the March 5 vote an outside chance to grab what could be a spirit-lifting victory, and perhaps even signal a way to get back in the game in California.Fred Davis, a Republican ad producer based in the Hollywood Hills who worked for the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain, created a political action committee to finance an advertising campaign to help Mr. James compete with his better-financed competitors. Mr. Davis was looking to raise $4 million from Republicans across the nation; he has since scaled back that goal a bit (he had raised $700,000 as of Friday).And Mr. James has retained John Weaver, a Republican political consultant who has long advised Mr. McCain, as his senior political adviser. Mr. Weaver has increasingly warned that Republicans are marginalizing themselves by moving to the right on issues like abortion, gay rights and immigration.“He is from central casting about what a future Republican candidate can look like in an urban or blue state and win,” Mr. Weaver said. “It’s important for the party. We have not done well nationally since we stopped winning in California.”Mr. James’s draw for these men is not only that he is a fiscal conservative who supports abortion rights and same-sex marriage, or that he is a colorful show horse in a field of gray. (At a debate the other night, he kept standing up when it was his turn to speak, even as everyone else settled politely into their chairs.)It is also who he is — or rather, what he is.“Here I am talking to this intelligent Republican guy that no one has ever heard of, who didn’t have any personal money, and I’m thinking, no way,” Mr. Davis said, recounting his first meeting with Mr. James. “A couple of days later, in researching the guy, there was some mention that he was gay.”“It was a great moment,” Mr. Davis said. “Because all of a sudden, all those social ills go away. There’s nothing to be scared of. It’s one of the things that made me decide we should go ahead with this venture.”In theory, this is as good a place as any to test-drive new Republican appeals. States do not get much bluer than California, in no small part because of the increase in the numbers of Latinos and Asian-Americans who are voting Democratic. Even a partial victory by Mr. James could be instructive for Republicans, not to mention a tonic for a party that needs one.It will not be easy.“On the national stage, he is the perfect example of the Republican dilemma,” said Bill Carrick, a Democratic consultant advising one of Mr. James’s Democratic rivals, Eric Garcetti, a member of the City Council. “He has to both energize a shrinking base of Republican voters who are decidedly more conservative than the rest of the city’s electorate, at the same time he reaches out to the ultimate Democratic voters. It’s a hell of a challenge.”But Mr. James could well affect the final outcome here. Given Mr. Davis’s effort and the crowded field, Mr. James is positioned to squeeze his way into a two-way runoff this spring. If he does, it will probably be at the expense of Wendy Greuel, the city comptroller, who is competing for the same votes in the San Fernando Valley where Mr. James has a constituency. Mr. James has directed most of his attacks against her.Whether he could beat a Democrat in a two-way race — polls suggest that the opponent would be Mr. Garcetti — is decidedly less likely.Mr. James has not always been a Republican; he registered as a Democrat during the height of the AIDS crisis, when he was a member of the board of the AIDS Project Los Angeles, viewing Democrats as much more concerned about AIDS issues. He declined to say for whom he voted in November; Mr. Obama won 61 percent of the vote in California.“I’m not going to go into the presidential race,” he said. “It’s history, it’s behind us, and it doesn’t apply to my race.”At the very least, Mr. James has provided a dash of drama to what has otherwise been a low-spark election to succeed Mayor Antonio R. Villaraigosa. At a League of Women Voters debate recently, the moderator asked the candidates whether they would renegotiate the 5.6 percent raises due for city workers next year if the city was still in a fiscal crisis.Mr. Garcetti responded with a barely audible “no.” Ms. Greuel gave an equivocal answer that produced a rustle of laughter among a few in the audience. Mr. James jumped to his feet.“My opponents gave them those raises,” he said. “They must be renegotiated, and I will do that.”Michael Saltz, who hosted a block party for Mr. James in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley, responded to that kind of appeal.“He is the only person running for mayor who is not responsible for the worst decline in the history of L.A.,” he said.Mr. Davis is known for making or proposing political advertisements intended to be provocative, sometimes too much so. He wrote an advertising plan for a political action committee working on behalf of Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, suggesting that it “do exactly what John McCain would not let us do” and produce advertisements linking Mr. Obama to the racially incendiary sermons delivered by Mr. Obama’s former minister, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr. The advertisement was never made.Mr. Davis said that while he was spending much of his energy on this race — his other clients include Rick Snyder, the Republican governor of Michigan — he was careful not to exaggerate its potential symbolism.“It’s a little tiny start,” he said. “I’m not silly. I don’t think the mayor of Los Angeles is going to be the next face of the Republican Party. But I think it would be an enormous wake-up call to the Republican Party if we succeeded.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/politics/top-gop-donors-seek-greater-say-in-senate-races.html,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa — The biggest donors in the Republican Party are financing a new group to recruit seasoned candidates and protect Senate incumbents from challenges by far-right conservatives and Tea Party enthusiasts who Republican leaders worry could complicate the party’s efforts to win control of the Senate.The group, the Conservative Victory Project, is intended to counter other organizations that have helped defeat establishment Republican candidates over the last two election cycles. It is the most robust attempt yet by Republicans to impose a new sense of discipline on the party, particularly in primary races.“There is a broad concern about having blown a significant number of races because the wrong candidates were selected,” said Steven J. Law, the president of American Crossroads, the “super PAC” creating the new project. “We don’t view ourselves as being in the incumbent protection business, but we want to pick the most conservative candidate who can win.”The effort would put a new twist on the Republican-vs.-Republican warfare that has consumed the party’s primary races in recent years. In effect, the establishment is taking steps to fight back against Tea Party groups and other conservative organizations that have wielded significant influence in backing candidates who ultimately lost seats to Democrats in the general election.The first test of the group’s effort to influence primary races could come here in Iowa, where some Republicans are already worrying about who will run for the seat being vacated by Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat. It is the first open Senate seat in Iowa since 1974, and Republicans are fearful of squandering a rare opportunity.The Conservative Victory Project, which is backed by Karl Rove and his allies who built American Crossroads into the largest Republican super PAC of the 2012 election cycle, will start by intensely vetting prospective contenders for Congressional races to try to weed out candidates who are seen as too flawed to win general elections.The project is being waged with last year’s Senate contests in mind, particularly the one in Missouri, where Representative Todd Akin’s comment that “legitimate rape” rarely causes pregnancy rippled through races across the country. In Indiana, the Republican candidate, Richard E. Mourdock, lost a race after he said that when a woman became pregnant during a rape it was “something God intended.”As Republicans rebuild from losing the White House race and seats in the House and Senate last year, party leaders and strategists are placing a heightened focus on taking control of the Senate next year. Republicans must pick up six seats to win a majority.Representative Steve King, a six-term Iowa Republican, could be among the earliest targets of the Conservative Victory Project. He said he had not decided whether he would run for the Senate, but the leaders of the project in Washington are not waiting to try to steer him away from the race.The group’s plans, which were outlined for the first time last week in an interview with Mr. Law, call for hard-edge campaign tactics, including television advertising, against candidates whom party leaders see as unelectable and a drag on the efforts to win the Senate. Mr. Law cited Iowa as an example and said Republicans could no longer be squeamish about intervening in primary fights.“We’re concerned about Steve King’s Todd Akin problem,” Mr. Law said. “This is an example of candidate discipline and how it would play in a general election. All of the things he’s said are going to be hung around his neck.”Mr. King has compiled a record of incendiary statements during his time in Congress, including comparing illegal immigrants to dogs and likening Capitol Hill maintenance workers to “Stasi troops” after they were ordered to install environmentally friendly light bulbs. But he rejected the suggestion that his voting record or previous remarks would keep him from winning if he decided to run for the Senate.“This is a decision for Iowans to make and should not be guided by some political staffers in Washington,” Mr. King said in an interview, pointing out that he won his Congressional race last year even though President Obama easily defeated Mitt Romney in Iowa. “The last election, they said I couldn’t win that, either, and the entire machine was against me.”The Conservative Victory Project will be a super PAC operating independently of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. It will disclose the names of donors and raise money separately from American Crossroads, officials said, because some donors were uncomfortable about aggressively weighing in on Republican-vs.-Republican fights.“It is a delicate and sensitive undertaking,” Mr. Law said. “Our approach will be to institutionalize the Buckley rule: Support the most conservative candidate who can win.”But by imposing the rule of the conservative leader William F. Buckley, the group could run afoul of Ronald Reagan’s “11th Commandment” to not speak ill of a fellow Republican.In Iowa, Cory Adams, the chairman of the Story County Republican Party, said the criticism aimed at Mr. King was unfair and misdirected. He warned of resistance from conservative activists if outside groups tried to interfere in the Senate race.“If he wants to run for the Senate, he should be allowed to run,” Mr. Adams said of Mr. King, whose Congressional district includes Story County. “The more people get to know him, the more they will like him.”The retirement announcements last month from Mr. Harkin and Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia, have created wide-open Senate races that are expected to attract several prospective candidates. The Conservative Victory Project is working to build a consensus with other groups on candidates who have the strongest chance of winning.Grover Norquist, who leads Americans for Tax Reform, a fiscally conservative advocacy group that plays a role in Republican primary races, said he welcomed a pragmatic sense of discipline in recruiting candidates. But he said it was incorrect to suggest that candidates backed by Tea Party groups were the only ones to lose, pointing to establishment Republicans in North Dakota and Montana who also lost their races last year.“People are imagining a problem that doesn’t exist,” Mr. Norquist said. “We’ve had people challenge the establishment guy and do swimmingly.”Sue Everhart, the head of the Georgia Republican Party, said she did not object to outside intervention. But because open Senate seats do not come along very often, she said,“we have six congressmen who want the job,” which could create a messy and divisive primary regardless of the efforts to control the race.“The primary has to sort itself out in Georgia,” Ms. Everhart said. “That’s what primaries are for. But we cannot afford to take our eye off the ball. This is going to be a very important election, and it’s paramount that Georgia keeps its Senate seat in Republican hands.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/politics/a-secret-bipartisan-group-with-its-own-immigration-plan.html,"The group met, on and off, in almost complete secrecy for nearly four years. It lost members to political disagreements, and to re-election battles. After the November elections, it regrouped and redoubled its efforts.Soon, the bipartisan group of about eight House members hopes to unveil its own immigration legislation, adding a voice to a growing swell of politicians — a bipartisan group in the Senate, as well as President Obama — who say they are serious about overhauling the nation’s immigration system by the end of the year.“For the last six or seven years, there had been no one to partner with, but since Nov. 6 there’s been a lot of new dance partners, and that’s good,” said Representative Luis V. Gutierrez, Democrat of Illinois and a member of the group. “The table is filling up with people, and people are talking and they’re having conversations.”Aides and members would not confirm on the record the group’s exact composition, but they said it had an equal number of Democrats and Republicans. In addition to Mr. Gutierrez, the chairman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus’s immigration task force, those involved in the discussions, aides said, include Representatives Xavier Becerra and Zoe Lofgren, both California Democrats; John Yarmuth, Democrat of Kentucky; Representatives John Carter and Sam Johnson, both Texas Republicans; Mario Diaz-Balart, Republican of Florida; and Raúl R. Labrador, Republican of Idaho.On Tuesday, the House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold its first hearing on the immigration issue. The bipartisan group of House members hopes to release legislation of its own, perhaps accompanied by its own set of principles, by Feb. 12, the day Mr. Obama delivers the State of the Union address.In a town where leaks are the currency of doing business, those with knowledge of the group said the legislators’ tight-lipped discipline was remarkable — and necessary.Immigration is a politically fraught issue, especially in the House, and many of the members wanted the safety of being able to present controversial ideas or walk away without details appearing in the news media. House Republicans involved with the group did not want to be associated with a topic they saw as potentially toxic, particularly with members of their party’s more conservative wing.The group has received far less attention than its Senate counterpart — in part by design, and in part because most lawmakers believe that the Senate will need to take the lead on immigration. Getting to 60 votes there, aides and advocates say, will probably be easier than reaching the 218 votes necessary in the House, where the legislation could face strong opposition from the far right.But rumors and names of group members began popping up in recent weeks, and Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, confirmed the group’s existence last month at a private luncheon, first reported by The Hill newspaper. (During a House recess last week, the group held a conference call to remind its members not to speak to the news media until it was ready to present its proposed legislation.)“I think there’s a bipartisan group of members that have been meeting now for three or four years,” Mr. Boehner said at the lunch. “Frankly, I think they basically have an agreement. I’ve not seen the agreement. I don’t know all the pitfalls in it. But it’s, in my view, the right group of members.”The group is in many ways a cross-section of the House. On one extreme is Mr. Labrador, a second-term member with Tea Party support; on the other is Mr. Gutierrez, an outspoken proponent of immigration reform who has been critical of Mr. Obama, saying he was moving too slowly. (One Republican aide joked that Mr. Gutierrez was “kind of the Raúl Labrador of the left.”)“You’ve got folks in this room who are truly, as conservative Republicans would call them, far-left liberals, and you’ve got some folks in the room who the liberals would call far-right conservatives,” said John Stone, a spokesman for Mr. Carter.Since the election, the group has met at least once a week, for at least an hour, when the House is in session. Those close to the group said its members largely agreed with the broad principles that were released by their Senate counterparts last Monday.“The goal is to fix what’s broken, and it’s pretty clear that a lot is broken,” Mr. Diaz-Balart said. “Do we recognize that we have a problem with the borders? Yes. Do we recognize that we have a problem with our visa system, where people don’t leave the country? Yes. Do we recognize that we have kids who were brought here by their parents and that’s an issue we have to deal with? Yes. Do we recognize the need for agricultural workers? Yes.”He added, “The devil is in the details, but I am hopeful that members of Congress who truly want to reach a solution will be able to.”The House and Senate working groups have been in touch. Mr. Gutierrez said he had a productive meeting in December with Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, and has talked with Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey.“We are in touch with our counterparts in the House,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, a New York Democrat and member of the bipartisan Senate group on immigration, confirmed at a news conference on Thursday.The House group is working on a timetable similar to the Senate’s. After it introduces its legislation, it plans to take it through the committee process and have a vote before the August recess.“The goal is a bill,” Mr. Stone said. “Let’s dot the i’s and cross the t’s, and that’s basically where it is, and let’s move forward. The goal is as soon as possible.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/will-justice-kennedy-vote-for-voting-rights.html,"Justice Anthony Kennedy regards himself as a teacher. The main role of the Supreme Court, he has said, is to instruct Americans about the Constitution’s fundamental values so they know what it takes to preserve American democracy.In Shelby County v. Holder, which the Supreme Court will hear this month, he is likely to cast the deciding vote between the conservatives and moderate liberals in a critical choice about the essence of democracy — the right to vote. The case presents a clash between America’s national commitment to racial equality and Alabama’s contention that states have “the constitutional prerogative to regulate their own elections.”In other landmark cases, like a 2003 decision recognizing privacy rights and a 2005 case striking down the death penalty for juveniles, Justice Kennedy voted for fairness. In these instances, he was a moralist, concerned about constitutional values yet willing to balance the importance of court precedents against the weight of the most salient facts. That approach should lead him to the fair result in this case, too.The issue in Shelby County is whether Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, viewed as the nation’s most effective civil rights law, remains necessary to prevent racially biased voting laws in nine states and parts of seven others with egregious histories of discrimination against minority voters.Under Section 5, those states and localities must prove to the Justice Department or a special court in Washington, D.C., that any proposed changes in election laws are not discriminatory before they can go into effect. “Covered” jurisdictions, in the statute’s terms, must “preclear” any changes.In 2009, the Supreme Court voted 8 to 1 to uphold Section 5, but Chief Justice John Roberts Jr. wrote that the section now raises “serious constitutional questions” and “must be justified by current needs.” Shelby County argues that it should be struck down because there is no longer proof of the “unremitting” defiance that existed when the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965.Justice Kennedy’s record makes it difficult to know for sure how he will vote in this case. But there is reason to hope that he will vote to uphold Section 5, because in cases on constitutional rights where the facts make clear an injustice, he tends to hew less to the simplicity of conservative ideology and to look for more nuanced solutions. In two important cases in the last decade, however, he has voted against using race as a factor in government policy. In a 2007 case involving the Seattle public schools, he cast the deciding vote with the conservatives in a 5-to-4 decision against letting the school system take account of a student’s race in assignment of students to achieve or maintain diversity in each school. And in a 2003 case, also decided 5 to 4, that preserved the use of race as one factor to consider in university admissions, he dissented.But in both rulings, he wrote opinions distinguishing his views from those of the conservative bloc. In the case about public school diversity, he rejected colorblindness as a basis for the court’s decision, calling it an “all-too-unyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when, in my view, it may be taken into account.” In the case about university admissions, he endorsed the use of race as a “plus factor” in admissions, but said the court’s majority had failed to scrutinize the program as rigorously as it must when it examines a racial preference.In the Shelby County case, as a federal trial court and a federal appeals court found, there is no room for equivocation. If Justice Kennedy votes to strike down Section 5, he will be calling a halt to an unfinished effort to end what the Supreme Court once called “an insidious and pervasive evil.”Congress gathered an enormous amount of evidence in 2006 about the persistence of voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions. It found that discrimination was still heavily concentrated in those places and so widespread that case-by-case litigation — what Justice Kennedy has called “very expensive,” “very long” and “very inefficient” — is inadequate.Without Section 5, from 1968 through 2004 more than 1,500 discriminatory voting changes  would have gone into effect. And last year, Section 5 blocked attempts to discriminate against voters in many parts of the country.In three momentous constitutional cases, Justice Kennedy voted to expand or uphold rights. Writing the 2003 majority opinion that found the Texas sodomy law unconstitutional, Justice Kennedy declared that “liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons” the right to express their sexuality as they choose. In the death penalty case in 2005, he recognized that under “the evolving standards of decency” it was no longer constitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles under 18. And in a landmark case in 1992 about abortion rights, Justice Kennedy joined Justices Sandra Day O’Connor and David Souter to uphold the core of Roe v. Wade.Justice Kennedy, in each of these cases, balanced facts, precedents and constitutional values differently, but in each one reached the conclusion that ultimately struck the American people as fair and proper. The Shelby County case presents the same kind of task. Justice now calls on him and the court to ensure the right to vote by upholding Section 5. "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/business/banks-at-least-had-a-friend-in-geithner.html,"TIMOTHY F. GEITHNER left the Treasury Department last week after four years as secretary. So how did he do?As financial adviser to the president in the tumultuous years immediately after the credit crisis, Mr. Geithner had immense sway over the government’s approach to all things economic. For everyday Americans, his major tasks included responding to the home foreclosure mess, unwinding federal bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and tackling the problem of financial institutions that are too big to manage and too interconnected for America’s good.But in scanning these agenda items, a pattern of winners and losers emerges. Let’s just say the financial institutions that dominate the United States were rarely on the losing end in the Geithner years.I wanted to speak with Mr. Geithner to allow him to respond to his critics and to get his take on his years in the job. A spokeswoman said he was on vacation and unavailable.So I turned to the Treasury’s Web site, where I found a list of 75 facts about Mr. Geithner’s tenure. Among other things, I learned that on his watch the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network assessed its two biggest penalties against banks for money-laundering and that the Treasury Department cracked down on offshore tax evasion. I also found he has logged more than 600,000 miles on international trips, played basketball in China and cricket in India, and has his signature on $17 billion of United States currency.Clearly, Mr. Geithner was busy. He had to deal with severe financial troubles overseas, navigate relationships with China and Europe and negotiate with Congress on contentious tax matters.Mr. Geithner has spoken to other journalists about the work that he and his colleagues did in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He said that this work “was incredibly effective for the broad interest of the economy and the financial system,” and that he believed his financial reform efforts “will significantly reduce the probability and the intensity of crises for a long period of time.” He also denied that bankers have too much political influence in Washington.That’s news to Jeff Connaughton, who was chief of staff to Ted Kaufman, a former Democratic senator from Delaware. Mr. Connaughton, author of “The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins,” said he believed that Treasury’s kid-glove treatment of the big banks would have the lasting effect of ensuring future crises.While banks recovered quickly and the Dow is around 14,000, he said last week, “the economy is still sputtering for millions of Americans whose livelihoods were devastated by the financial crisis.” He added: “The legal and regulatory framework that Geithner leaves behind for preventing a future financial crisis inspires little confidence, especially amid scandals emerging almost weekly at banks too big and complex to manage, regulate, police and fail.”How did Treasury favor the banks? Consider its answer to the foreclosure mess. After promising to help four million borrowers, its Home Affordable Modification Program at last count had helped about one-quarter of that number.One reason for this is that the program was flawed from the start.First, the Treasury made the program voluntary, awarding funds to participating banks but failing to penalize those that did not. The program was all carrot, no stick.Worse, the initial plan didn’t require the banks to write down second liens they may have held — like home equity lines — from borrowers whose original loans were modified. This let the banks put their interests ahead of both borrowers and those who held the first mortgages.Unwinding the Troubled Asset Relief Program was another area where the department fell short. Eager to trumpet the success of TARP and other bailout programs, for example, Treasury boasted last spring that taxpayers would likely make money on them.Such a claim, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, should “immediately discredit the teller.”Treasury’s accounting for TARP and the other programs didn’t factor in the below-market rates the recipients paid on these loans. “We did them an enormous favor,” Mr. Baker said in an interview last week, “at a time when liquidity commanded an incredible premium.”Neither, critics say, was Treasury transparent about TARP or willing to provide data to Congress on the program’s progress. “Under Secretary Geithner’s leadership, Treasury consistently overstated the results of its actions, painting a rosier picture than reality,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. “Without the special inspector general, the public wouldn’t have a clear, numbers-driven point of view on TARP.” FINALLY, there’s the matter of Treasury’s response to the weightiest issue of all: banks that are too large to succeed.Back in 2010, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Mr. Kaufman were co-sponsors of the Safe Banking Act, which proposed placing tough limits on banks’ size. If it had passed, it would have imposed a strict 10 percent cap on any bank holding company’s share of United States deposits and set a 6 percent limit on leverage.The act was a way to begin reining in the huge institutions that had caused so much trouble in the credit debacle. It could also have protected taxpayers from having to make future rescues.A good thing for Main Street, in other words.But it was not to be. Among the bill’s most aggressive opponents was, yes, the Treasury.“We were disappointed,” Mr. Brown said in an interview on Thursday. “Not only did Treasury oppose it, but they proudly opposed it. If the Treasury had spoken out for it we could have gotten very close to winning.”Thankfully, Mr. Brown has not given up on the idea of reducing big banks’ size and threat to taxpayers. He and Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, have asked the Government Accountability Office to quantify the size of the advantages — and implied taxpayer subsidies — that large financial institutions enjoy over their smaller brethren. The study is expected to take about a year to complete.“I like Tim personally,” Mr. Brown said of Mr. Geithner. “But he was better at putting out the fire than preventing the next one.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/nyregion/so-how-did-mayor-koch-do.html,"Ed Koch, the blunt-spoken and theatrical three-term mayor of New York City, who became a national emblem for the way New Yorkers talk and behave, often asked straphangers at subway stops to assess his record with a “How’m I doin’?”With his death on Friday at 88, it seemed only fitting to ask that question once more — in retrospect.There is no doubt that Mr. Koch restored the spirit of the city after years of urban decay that had crystallized in the city’s near bankruptcy, and that reached a nadir of sorts in 1977 with the Son of Sam killings, a blackout and riots. Mr. Koch, a Democrat, took office in January 1978 and, with his moxie, was able to quickly create a sense among New Yorkers that someone was fighting to turn the city around.“The city needed hope, it needed a champion, it needed a voice,” said Mitchell Moss, a professor of urban policy at New York University. “Ed Koch became that voice.”Even the Rev. Calvin O. Butts III, the pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, who tangled frequently with Mr. Koch over what he felt was the mayor’s insensitivity to African-Americans, said Mr. Koch was the right mayor for his time.“If you’ve got to have a mayor for New York City, you need a guy like Ed Koch because he’s a rough-and-tumble kind of guy who speaks up and fights back,” he said.The Koch-era legacy is substantial. Experts cite the investment of billions of dollars in rebuilding abandoned housing, which revived desolate areas of the South Bronx, Harlem and central Brooklyn; the restoration of the city’s fiscal integrity to the point where banks and government watchdogs were ready to let it manage its own finances; the rehabilitation of neglected parks; the genesis of Times Square’s transformation from a sleazy, dangerous crossroads to a family-friendly entertainment and office center; the trading in of federal money designated to build a new West Side Highway for money that would buy subway trains and buses; the pressure on the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to virtually eliminate subway graffiti; and the enacting of a campaign finance law in 1988 under which candidates would limit their spending in exchange for receiving public matching funds.On the ledger’s deficit side, experts say Mr. Koch needlessly antagonized African-American New Yorkers and allowed his reputation for let-the-chips-fall-where-they-may integrity to be tarnished by corruption scandals that started in the Parking Violations Bureau and raised questions about his alliances with political bosses. Together, those failures might have cost him a fourth term.While opinions about the former mayor may vary, there is no doubt he left a notable mark in several areas.HOUSINGTo grasp the scope of Mr. Koch’s accomplishment, consider the visit that President Jimmy Carter made in 1977 to the South Bronx, where he stood with Mayor Abraham D. Beame in a rubble-strewed patch of Charlotte Street against a backdrop of ghostly, gutted buildings. That characteristic landscape changed dramatically starting in 1986 with a 10-year plan by Mr. Koch that led to the spending of more than $5 billion on building low- and moderate-income housing and on rehabilitating vacant buildings. The program eventually created more than 150,000 affordable apartments, according to Ted Houghton, executive director of the Supportive Housing Network of New York. Charlotte Street itself was turned into a row of suburban-style ranch houses that a few years ago were selling for $500,000 apiece. There are few lots in the Bronx that sit empty anymore.“When you walk through today’s vibrant neighborhoods in Harlem, Bed-Stuy and the South Bronx, thank Ed Koch,” Mr. Houghton said in an e-mail. “If it wasn’t for his 10-year housing plan, we’d still be looking at acres and acres of abandoned buildings, like one continues to see in a lot of less fortunate, older Eastern cities.”PARKSIn the years before Mr. Koch became mayor, many of the city’s signature parks had gone to seed — partly as a result of lack of money, but also because of a poorly administered and patronage-ridden bureaucracy. Central Park had become so dangerous it was ridiculed by late-night comedians.“In the Koch administration, the parks took on an elevated position that they hadn’t really had since the Robert Moses era,” said Holly Leicht, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks.Parks commissioners like Gordon J. Davis and Henry J. Stern decentralized their department, delegating more authority to officials in the boroughs and appointing new parks administrators for Central Park and Prospect Park. Those administrators ultimately cobbled together public-private partnerships that have rejuvenated both parks. The Sheep Meadow, virtually a dust bowl when Koch took office, was turned into a green carpet, and the crumbling Bethesda Fountain into an aesthetic jewel. Adrian Benepe, who was a park ranger when Mr. Koch took office and eventually became the commissioner under Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said a key moment was “having Simon and Garfunkel do a concert in Central Park in the early ‘80s, because it showed that Central Park was safe and fun at night.”CRIMEMr. Koch’s record on crime is more mixed. A few years into his tenure, crime began to recede, with murders declining to 1,386 in 1985 from 1,818 in 1980. Jeremy Travis, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, who was a special adviser to Mr. Koch during his third term, said gains were made by techniques like concentrating police personnel on open-air drug markets where people were brazenly lining up to buy drugs. But the unseen rise of the crack cocaine epidemic in the mid-1980s led to a resurgence, as easy profits enticed many amateurs into drug dealing and neighborhood wars broke out. The administration’s response was “heroic,” Mr. Travis said, but hobbled by understaffing in the Police Department — about 26,000 officers at the time — as a result of the layoffs demanded by the 1970s fiscal crisis.“If you dialed 911, you couldn’t get a car to the scene in time,” Mr. Travis said. “An under-resourced department is not effective in fighting crime.”By 1990, the year after Mr. Koch left office, murders hit a historic peak of 2,251. The situation did not begin to be reversed until the city hired 5,000 more officers late in the administration of Mayor David N. Dinkins. Another form of crime, corruption, was spawned in Mr. Koch’s Parking Violations Bureau. There were no revelations suggesting that Mr. Koch personally profited, but the scandals left a stain because they indicated he was sometimes willing to make patronage appointments to sustain the backing of Democratic bosses like Meade H. Esposito, Donald R. Manes and Stanley M. Friedman.HEALTHLarry Kramer, the gay rights advocate who wrote the play “The Normal Heart""about the AIDS epidemic, recently accused Mr. Koch of ignoring the disease’s spread in a city with a large gay population because “he was terrified everyone would find out he was gay and he would lose his support from the real estate industry.” Mr. Kramer said Mr. Koch did not “tell people to change their behavior” and refused to meet with or finance gay activists. (Though he once responded to a questioner that he was heterosexual, Mr. Koch repeatedly said that his love life was nobody’s business but his own.)Stanley Brezenoff, the chief executive officer of Continuum Health Partners and a former deputy mayor under Mr. Koch, offered a different picture of Mr. Koch’s response to the AIDS epidemic. “It took a long time to recognize what was going on,” Mr. Brezenoff said, “and as we came to grips with it we became more focused on identifying concrete steps to take.” Mr. Koch, he said, agonized over a step like closing bathhouses used for promiscuous sex because it meant having to dispatch “investigators into bathhouses and spying on people in their most private moments.”One health policy decision Mr. Koch came to regret was the closing — for reasons of poor performance — of Sydenham Hospital in Harlem. Mr. Koch said in recent years that he had not fully appreciated how important the hospital was to black doctors, who often had trouble receiving admitting privileges elsewhere.Mr. Brezenoff, who was president of the city’s Health and Hospitals Corporation from 1981 to 1982, credited Mr. Koch for spurring “the renaissance” of the agency, which had been in disarray, and for focusing its mission on primary care.RACE RELATIONSFrom the beginning, Mr. Koch frequently found himself at loggerheads with black ministers and politicians. The Sydenham closing stirred enormous resentment in Harlem. So did Mr. Koch’s abrasive style, which led him to call antipoverty organizers who were abusing the system “poverty pimps.” He might also have realized that more than a few of his white supporters appreciated such tough talk.“He was a politician and he knew what crowd he had to play to,” Mr. Butts, pastor of Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem, said.But David R. Jones, president of the Community Service Society of New York and a former Koch adviser, pointed out that Mr. Koch assembled the most diverse team of deputies and commissioners City Hall had ever seen, including Basil A. Paterson, Herman Badillo and Mr. Jones. Later, he appointed Benjamin Ward as the city’s first black police commissioner.Mr. Koch also suffered because of racially charged episodes that sprang up on his watch: the 1984 shooting death of a 66-year-old black woman, Eleanor Bumpurs, by a white police officer during an eviction; the 1986 beating of three black men by a white gang in Howard Beach, Queens; the shooting death of Yusuf K. Hawkins by white youths weeks before the 1989 election.Despite his condemnation of the mob beatings, it was hard to tamp down a sense among blacks that his public rhetoric — in the 1988 presidential campaign, for example, he said Jews would be “crazy” to vote for Jesse Jackson because of his “Hymietown” slur about New York and his support for a Palestinian homeland — may have helped foster an atmosphere in which some young whites felt emboldened to commit such assaults.Still, Mr. Koch seemed to redeem himself in his post-mayoralty. The Rev. Al Sharpton Jr. became a friend, and Mr. Butts, who once said Mr. Koch was “worse than a racist, he was an opportunist,” said last week: “I never got the impression that he was a racist. He had his prejudices like everybody else and he allowed his temper and his I-know-what’s-best-for-everybody attitude to get in the way of sound judgment.”TRANSITWith its graffiti-coated subway cars and frequent breakdowns, the transit system Mr. Koch inherited had become one of the bleakest symbols of the city’s tailspin. Ridership had fallen to its lowest level since 1917, even before the modern subway system had been completed, according to Gene Russianoff, staff attorney for the Straphangers Campaign.While he had few direct powers to change matters, Mr. Koch harangued the Transportation Authority for its crackling, inaudible announcements; doubled, to $200 million, the city’s contribution for rebuilding; and urged that dogs patrol the subway yards, an idea that was barely tried. While originally a proponent of the West Side Highway, Mr. Koch eventually fought for trading in the federal highway funds for $1 billion to buy new subway cars. The last graffiti-marked car was taken out of service in his last year in office."

Ehlers (South) opened one club, promising 16-plus points. Krantz (North) responded one diamond, indicating zero to seven points. East intervened with two clubs, showing either long diamonds or a major-minor two-suiter. West’s two-diamond advance was pass-or-correct: to play opposite diamonds or asking East to show his major with a two-suiter. After two passes, South balanced with two spades, which was passed out.West led his higher diamond. East won with his ace and returned the diamond queen to South’s king.Declarer had five top losers: one spade, one heart, two diamonds and one club. He was worried about a second trump loser. In particular a fourth round of diamonds from East might have been able to promote a second trump trick for West.To try to stop this from happening South led a spade to dummy’s nine and continued with the spade jack. (Interestingly, this is also the percentage play for four tricks in the suit.)West took the trick and shifted to a club. East won with his ace, cashed the diamond jack and led another diamond.Declarer ruffed high, cashed his other top trump and claimed, conceding one more trick to the heart ace.Plus 110 was worth 21.86 matchpoints out of 25.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/us/politics/varied-state-responses-to-issue-of-gun-violence.html,"Although the debate over curbing gun violence after the massacre in Newtown, Conn., is breaking down mostly along partisan lines in the nation’s statehouses — with several Democratic governors calling for stricter gun laws and most Republicans urging tighter security or revamped mental health policies — the handful of exceptions show the political and geographical complexities of the issue.More than a dozen governors invoked the Newtown school shooting in their State of the State addresses in recent weeks, and most have weighed in on the shooting in other forums.Several Democratic governors, mainly along the East Coast, are calling for banning some semiautomatic weapons or large-capacity magazines, while several Republican governors have pressed for other measures, noting their opposition to more restrictive gun laws.But the state-level debate has not always followed party lines.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican who is mentioned as a possible presidential candidate, recently noted that he had long supported his state’s laws, which he described as “some of the toughest gun-control measures in place in the country.”Gov. Mark Dayton of Minnesota, a Democrat, was quoted after the shooting as saying that his “reading of the Constitution is that it provides a complete permission for any law-abiding citizen to possess firearms, whichever ones he or she chooses, and the ammunition to go with that.”Another Democrat, Gov. Mike Beebe of Arkansas, is likely to sign a bill working its way through the Republican-controlled legislature that would allow people to take concealed handguns into churches that choose to allow them.But a more traditional party-line approach is being taken elsewhere. Democratic governors in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland and Massachusetts are among those calling for stricter gun laws, and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York has already won the passage of sweeping gun measures since the Newtown shooting.“Who can watch the sad images of the last several weeks, who can see the pictures of those young faces, and honestly say that we are doing enough?” Gov. Martin O’Malley of Maryland, a Democrat, asked in his State of the State address last week. Mr. O’Malley urged state lawmakers to ban the sale of “military-style assault weapons,” require licenses for buying handguns, bolster mental health treatment and information sharing, and spend more on school security.Gov. Mike Pence of Indiana, a Republican who took office this year, said in his speech that he would seek additional money in the state budget for “a comprehensive school safety review,” but he made it clear that he would oppose limiting access to guns.“All of us were heartbroken after every parent’s worst nightmare unfolded in Newtown, Conn.,” said Mr. Pence, a former congressman. “While others have rushed to the well-worn arguments over gun control, Hoosiers know this is not about access to firearms. It is about access to schools. Hoosiers have responsibilities to protect our kids, and Hoosiers have rights. We will protect our kids, and we will protect our rights.”On the federal level, the Obama administration’s push for stronger gun laws faces tough opposition in the Republican-controlled House and garnered a muted reaction even from the Senate’s top Democrat.Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, in an appearance Sunday on ABC’s “This Week,” said, “I want to get something done on guns.” But on specific measures, his language was guarded.He noted that he had opposed the 1994 ban on assault weapons but would consider one now. On restricting high-capacity magazines, he said, “I think that’s something we definitely have to take a look at.” Regarding universal background checks, he said, “Yeah, we need to increase that.”But as a gun owner himself, Mr. Reid said he would not allow the influence of the National Rifle Association to prevent the Senate from acting.As a polarized Washington debates President Obama’s proposals, the state-level debate is also unfolding at an unusually partisan moment, with more states controlled by just one party than at any time in the past six decades. Republicans have the upper hand, holding the governor’s office and legislative majorities in 24 states, while the Democrats control both the executive and legislative branches in just 13 states. The stark divide can be seen in many of the bills being weighed in states this year.In Tennessee, which is controlled by Republicans, lawmakers have introduced bills that would allow school employees to carry guns, let people keep guns and ammunition locked in their cars in public and private parking lots, and bar state money from being used to enforce any new federal law or executive order that “imposes restrictions on citizens who lawfully possess or carry firearms in this state.”In heavily Democratic Massachusetts, Gov. Deval Patrick is calling for legislation to ban magazines containing more than seven rounds, require background checks for private gun sales and limit people to buying one gun a month. In his address to lawmakers, he said the proposals would “help stop tragedies like Newtown or the recent shooting of a 13-year-old boy in Roxbury on his way to choir practice.”Most Republicans said they had drawn other lessons from the Newtown shooting. Gov. Jan Brewer of Arizona, a Republican, said in her speech that “the massacre at Sandy Hook Elementary was unimaginable” but rejected calls for stricter gun laws.“Arizonans have reduced crime by punishing criminals, and not by infringing on the rights of law-abiding gun owners,” she said.Ms. Brewer focused instead on school safety, saying her budget would call for more money for school resource officers to provide security. “Our job now is to take common-sense steps that lessen the likelihood of a similar tragedy striking Arizona — while resisting the urge to turn a school into a fortress,” she said.Gov. C. L. Otter of Idaho alluded to the Newtown shooting in his address as he called for building a 579-bed mental health facility at a prison complex south of Boise.“We all saw just a few weeks ago the terrible impact on a community and a nation when mental illness leads to tragedy,” Mr. Otter said, echoing a commonly held belief, although the authorities have not described the mental state of Adam Lanza, the Newtown gunman, or said if he suffered from mental illness. Mr. Otter also ordered a review of school safety.Some Democratic governors have said they are holding out hope for a federal law. Gov. Peter Shumlin of Vermont, the chairman of the Democratic Governors Association who was endorsed last year by the National Rifle Association Political Victory Fund, has opposed taking action on gun laws at the state level but has said he supports Mr. Obama’s recommendations.And Gov. Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, a Democrat who has said he would pursue measures on gun control, school safety and mental health in response to the shooting that killed 20 first graders and six educators in his state, said those issues must be addressed at the national level. “As long as weapons continue to travel up and down I-95,” he told lawmakers, “what is available for sale in Florida or Virginia can have devastating consequences here in Connecticut.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/business/campaign-just-wants-to-say-know-to-kidney-disease.html,"A public service advertising campaign that seeks to help in the fight against kidney disease is using new technologies not only to lower production costs but also to gain attention.The campaign, now under way, was created for the National Kidney Foundation in New York by a company, also in New York, named Public Domain, which is a kind of hybrid advertising agency and a production company.The campaign was produced almost entirely through desktop and laptop computers, Web connections and Skype, the Internet calling service. That enabled the foundation to get, for a budget estimated in the low six figures, dozens of video and audio commercials as well as print, outdoor and digital ads.Skype also plays a leading role in the creative approach the campaign takes. The video commercials — which can be watched on television, You Tube and the foundation’s Web site, kidney.org — are composed of edited conversations on Skype.The commercials begin and end with the sound effects that are heard by people who use Skype, including the incoming call ring and the signoff noise denoting a call’s conclusion. The videos even include, with the approval of Skype, the Skype logo in the upper right corner.The audio commercials, intended for radio stations, also use the Skype sound effects. The audio spots, which feature the actor Ken Howard as the voice-over announcer, are based on the videos, with the dialogue spoken by actors.In addition to working on the advertising aspects of the campaign, Public Domain also developed new graphics and a new logo for the foundation.The goal of the campaign is to disseminate more information about both kidney disease and the foundation. For instance, the outdoor and print ads carry this headline: “One in three American adults is at risk for kidney disease. Are you the one?”To underscore the idea that the ads are intended to impart knowledge, the theme of the campaign is “Now! You know.”(Fun fact: For decades, the United Press International news service sent to newspapers around the country brief items that could be used to fill out columns of type if they came up short. The items, which would now probably be called factoids, carried the headline “Now You Know.”)The campaign is the result of a strategic plan that the foundation began developing at the end of 2011, says Bruce Skyer, who became chief executive at the foundation in October 2011 after serving for a year and a half as its chief operating officer.“We talked to volunteers, board members, staff members” and the medical community, Mr. Skyer says, “and one thing came out: We needed to raise awareness of kidney disease and the National Kidney Foundation.”“Among those at risk, and those who actually have the disease, their knowledge is very low,” he adds, partly because “the kidney is a difficult organ to understand.”“It does so many different things,” Mr. Skyer says, “and also, kidney disease is called a co-morbidity, because its two leading causes are diabetes and high blood pressure.”The result of all that, he adds, is that kidney disease “sort of gets lost in the sauce.”“There have been campaigns in the past” from the foundation, Mr. Skyer says, including a recent one that carried the theme “Love your kidneys,” but “none that have really resonated” with the estimated 26 million Americans who have kidney disease or the estimated 73 million who are at risk for it.“We need to get to those folks,” he adds, “if we are truly the voice of the patient.”As the strategic plan was under development, Mr. Skyer was put in touch by Bill Cella — the former chairman of the foundation who was a longtime top executive at media agencies — with Tim Davis, a onetime executive vice president for media at the Advertising Council in New York, which coordinates the ad industry’s efforts in the realm of public service campaigns.“I called Tim up,” Mr. Skyer recalls, and told him something along the lines of this: “ ‘Here is a disease that is the ninth most common killer in the United States and nobody knows about it.’ ” Early last year, Mr. Davis joined the foundation, with the title of chief advancement officer.(The title stems from “advancing the mission of the organization,” Mr. Davis explains, in terms of “public awareness and fund-raising.”)The foundation needed to find a way to “simplify a complicated message,” Mr. Davis says, and at the same time “create social change” among those who are at risk.“If they can catch it early and treat it with diet; or diet and exercise; or diet and exercise and medication, they can stop the progression,” Mr. Davis says.Then, too, the foundation also needed to figure out “who to talk to, how to reach them in a compelling way and how to do it cost-effectively,” he adds.Enter Public Domain, through Mr. Davis’s relationship with David Hale, a co-founder and co-creative director there. The two had worked together on campaigns for the Actors Fund that included an annual online fund-raiser known as the Auction of 1,000 Stars.After discussions between Mr. Hale and Mr. Davis last summer, Mr. Hale brought in Steven Shore, the other co-founder and co-creative director at Public Domain. Mr. Shore and Mr. Hale talked with about 60 people at the foundation as they conducted what they call a “swot” assessment, for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.The determination was that whatever campaign the foundation sponsored “had to speak to a lot of different constituencies,” Mr. Shore says, even though “its means were fairly limited.”That led to a decision to go with what he describes as “scalable video,” clips that can be produced in large quantities for relatively small sums.The idea to center the campaign on Skype came “in the best way David and I get ideas,” Mr. Shore says, “when we are arguing with each other.”“My idea was, let’s eliminate production altogether,” he adds, by featuring Skype, and once Skype gave its approval to use its logo, the campaign was a go.The videos were directed by Jonathan David, with whom Mr. Shore and Mr. Hale have previously worked. “He understands how to drill in when speaking to people,” Mr. Shore says, and was able to make the videos “emotional,” as low-band and jumpy as they are.”In one video clip, an older man named Jeff talks about getting a screening from the foundation that he read about in the newspaper. “When you know, it’s almost too late,” he says. “So know before your kidney tells you.”In another video, a woman named Lynda discusses “a simple test” for kidney disease that involves urine. It is better than getting your blood tested, she says, laughing, because “no one ever fainted when they peed in the cup.”In a third video, a young woman named Leah recalls how, on her 16th birthday, she found out she was “dying,” adding, “I was lucky enough to get diagnosed.” A fourth video includes two women, Valerie and Karen, talking about how a donated kidney has made them friends.The audio commercials start with words from Mr. Howard. “Did you know one in three adults is at risk for kidney disease?” he asks at the beginning of one spot. “If you have high blood pressure or diabetes, you could be the one.”The spot continues with a Skype sound effect and an actor who reads lines that are inspired by what the older man named Jeff says in his video clip. It ends with part of what Jeff signed off with: “When you know, it’s almost too late.”Another audio commercial starts with Mr. Howard asking, “Did you know when you donate a kidney, you give the gift of life?” It continues with an actress’s voice discussing how people are “born with two healthy kidneys, but only need one.”“When I think of giving up something I don’t need in exchange for a life, it’s no contest,” she says.A third audio spot begins with Mr. Howard asking, “Did you know 26 million Americans have kidney disease and most don’t know it?”An actor then is heard talking about how he called the foundation “the day I was diagnosed” and discussing his situation with a “young lady” who also had kidney disease; she “stayed on the phone with me and walked me through, step by step.”“She showed me there could be life after kidney disease,” the actor says.The small budget for the campaign, Mr. Skyer of the foundation says, “ended up being a blessing in disguise” because the audio and video spots turned out “raw, real, urgent.”According to Mr. Davis of the foundation, the spots are being distributed to 11,000 radio stations and 4,000 television stations. (Nonprofit organizations distribute public service campaigns to the media and ask that the ads run free, on a pro bono basis.)Already, Mr. Davis says, video commercials have been run by national cable channels like A&E, CNN, Hallmark Channel and HLN, along with the Airport Channel.“We’re finding more people who say, ‘I know somebody’ with kidney disease or ‘Somebody in my family has it and I’m happy to help,’ ” he adds.“We’d love to find a way to create schedules,” Mr. Davis says, meaning defined times for the spots to run, “instead of relying on run of schedule,” which means the spots appear at the discretion of the station, channel or network.An eventual goal, Mr. Skyer says, is to raise money to buy prominent time slots for the commercials and “not just depend on the kindness of” those in the media to run them pro bono.•If you like In Advertising, be sure to read the Advertising column that runs Monday through Friday in the Business Day section of The New York Times print edition and on nytimes.com.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/opinion/a-historic-trial-in-guatemala.html,"CAMBRIDGE, Mass.LAST Monday, a brave Guatemalan judge made history. In greenlighting a public trial for the former dictator Efraín Ríos Montt on charges of genocide, the judge, Miguel Ángel Gálvez, made his country the first in the Americas to prosecute a former head of state, in its own domestic courts, for the ultimate crime.Mr. Ríos Montt, a former cold war general whom Ronald Reagan defended as having gotten a “bum rap,” will finally face his accusers — three decades after his alleged crimes, and a year after he was indicted.Mr. Ríos Montt seized power by a coup in March 1982, taking charge of a counterinsurgency that was then two decades old. To deny the guerrillas local support, he sent soldiers to wipe out hundreds of Mayan villages. In 1999, after the war’s end, the United Nations-sponsored Historical Clarification Commission tallied thousands of rapes, tortures, disappearances, violations of cultural rights and extrajudicial executions his forces committed while he held power, and concluded that he presided over acts of genocide.The dictator was ousted (in another coup) in August 1983, but this being Guatemala, he was not sent to prison but became a right-wing congressman and a presidential candidate. (He lost.) No other high-ranking Guatemalan Army or police official was brought to justice. Military rule formally ended in 1985, and a peace accord was signed in 1996. But activists seeking to shed light on the past were still threatened and killed.In 2011, Guatemalans elected as president Otto Pérez Molina, a former general who commanded troops in the Ixil region — the focus of the genocide trial — during Mr. Ríos Montt’s rule. “There was no genocide,” Mr. Pérez Molina insists.How, then, to account for Guatemala’s move to prosecute its most notorious public figure? Most of the credit goes to survivors and victims’ families for 30 years of tenacious research and advocacy. International human rights groups, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, the United Nations and foreign governments helped. And Guatemala’s attorney general since 2010, Claudia Paz y Paz, has revolutionized the prosecutor’s office, pushing cases involving war crimes, corruption and narcotrafficking.Still, even if found guilty, the general will never suffer a punishment commensurate with his alleged crimes. He is 86 and more likely to remain under house arrest than to be sent to prison. As the Guatemalan journalist Juan Carlos Llorca points out, maybe he has already won.Or has he? The overarching goal of the Guatemalan counterinsurgency was to destroy all oppositional thinking. But as Hannah Arendt wrote, any state’s efforts to make its opponents “disappear in silent anonymity” are doomed to failure. That Mr. Ríos Montt now faces trial is proof of that. When the judge’s decision was announced Monday, the packed courtroom erupted in cheers. The dictator had lost.Human rights trials of former leaders are imperfect means for reckoning with the past. A war that systematically kills civilians, silences generations of ideas, displaces millions and pits neighbors against one another quite exceeds the boundaries of the juridical imagination.So what is also needed is historical imagination. Mr. Ríos Montt’s trial will not redress the socioeconomic roots of the long conflict. It will not redistribute the power and wealth so jealously held by a tiny few. It will not even mean that the rule of law now exists in Guatemala. The trial is the beginning of a process, not its conclusion.Historical imagination, and the record, suggest that Guatemala cannot stop here. Mr. Pérez Molina has been pushing Washington to resume giving Guatemala’s army aid, which was suspended over human rights concerns in 1990. The Obama administration has, wisely, conditioned that possibility on reform of the justice system and an end to impunity for heinous crimes. This trial alone is not enough to justify resuming aid to one of Latin America’s most notorious armies.In 1999, President Bill Clinton expressed regret that Washington had backed Guatemala’s repression, and his administration declassified thousands of documents for the Historical Clarification Commission’s use. Today, the Obama administration has another opportunity to partly right the United States’ historical wrongs in Central America — by supporting Guatemala’s legal initiatives and being firm with a military that hasn’t moved far beyond its dark past.Mr. Pérez Molina and the military may be content to let one aging patriarch of state terror be thrown under the bus, diverting attention from their own roles in atrocities. But once one thread is pulled, even the most tightly woven fabric can unravel. Even in Guatemala, the arc of history can be bent toward justice."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/us/politics/obama-says-loopholes-could-factor-in-budget-deal.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama said in a televised interview on Sunday that he could foresee a budget deal in Congress that did not include further increases in tax rates but instead focused on eliminating loopholes and deductions.Mr. Obama has generally insisted that all revenue options, including higher rates, should be considered to slow the rise of federal budget deficits. But in the interview with Scott Pelley of CBS News, he said, “I don’t think the issue right now is raising rates.”Having just raised rates on people earning more than $450,000 a year, Mr. Obama said the focus now should be on targeted spending cuts and changes to the tax code, which he said favored the wealthy.“Can we close some loopholes and deductions that folks who are well connected and have a lot of accountants and lawyers can take advantage of so they end up paying lower rates than a bus driver or a cop?” Mr. Obama said in the 10-minute interview in the White House.“If you combine those things together,” Mr. Obama said, a budget deal could reduce the deficit “without raising rates again.”Still, Mr. Obama did not rule out tax increases, saying, “There’s no doubt we need additional revenue.”Republicans, having acquiesced to the tax increase in the year-end budget deal, are now insisting that further deficit reduction must come through spending cuts.Budget experts say that to raise substantial revenue through loopholes and deductions, lawmakers would have to focus on deductions on mortgage interest payments and charitable donations.Mr. Obama said the continuing fiscal crisis in Washington was to blame for the contraction in the nation’s economy in the last quarter of 2012."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/world/asia/pentagon-expects-us-to-retain-presence-in-afghanistan.html,"WASHINGTON — The Pentagon’s top civilian and military officials on Sunday expressed an expectation, even a desire, that American troops would remain in Afghanistan after the NATO mission ends in December 2014, although they emphasized that no decision had been made.Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta and Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the United States would sustain a strategic partnership with Afghanistan, and they cited a decision by the NATO heads of state during a summit meeting last year in President Obama’s hometown, Chicago, that long-term support for Kabul would include military assistance.“In Chicago, we also said that we’re committing to an enduring presence,” Mr. Panetta said. “And I believe that the president of the United States is going to do everything possible to implement the Chicago agreements.”During joint appearances on the NBC News program “Meet the Press” and the CNN program “State of the Union,” Mr. Panetta and General Dempsey sought to define and defend an 11-year-old mission in Afghanistan whose objectives have become fuzzy in the minds of many Americans. Mr. Obama is weighing how rapidly to withdraw the remaining troops and considering how many to propose leaving there after 2014.In advance of the Washington visit last month by President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, some White House officials said one option would be to leave no troops behind, though some viewed those comments as a negotiating tactic. Kabul and Washington must agree on any American military presence after the conclusion of the NATO mandate.Some sticking points remain, including a Defense Department demand that American service personnel receive immunity from prosecution in Afghanistan, with any misconduct to be adjudicated under the Pentagon’s Uniform Code of Military Justice, not Afghan law. The Departments of Defense and State also sought, but failed to secure, a similar agreement to leave a sizable training and advisory force in Iraq after the end of combat there.“No one has ever suggested zero to me,” General Dempsey said, referring to the number of postwar troops in Afghanistan, although he stressed that “the decision on numbers hasn’t been made yet.”Pressed to define the mission in Afghanistan, General Dempsey said it was “to establish a secure and capable Afghanistan that can govern itself and ensure that Al Qaeda never again establishes a safe haven in that country.” He argued that coalition forces have diminished the Taliban’s capabilities. “Violence has gone down,” he said. “We’re also developing an Afghan Army that has increased its operational skill to provide security.”Mr. Panetta expressed confidence that President Obama’s choice to succeed him, former Senator Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, would be a strong defense secretary, despite a bitterly partisan confirmation hearing last week in which Mr. Hagel stumbled over some answers. General Dempsey noted that several important security issues — like Afghanistan, where 66,000 American troops are at war — were nearly absent during a full day of Senate questioning of Mr. Hagel.Mr. Panetta criticized the agenda pursued by some senators in their questioning of Mr. Hagel. He said, for example, that not enough attention had been paid to the Pentagon budget and what would happen if automatic budget cuts, called sequestration, go into effect as scheduled on March 1.He said that if a fiscal deal was not reached to stop those cuts, the armed forces would be weakened and less able to respond to global crises.“There are members up on the Capitol Hill that are saying, ‘Oh no, we’re going to stand back and let sequester happen,’ ” Mr. Panetta said. “Let me tell you, if sequester happens, it is going to badly damage the readiness of the United States of America.”He said the cuts required under sequestration would “go right at readiness, right at maintenance, right at training.”“We are gonna weaken the United States and make it much more difficult for us to respond to the crises in the world,” he said.General Dempsey said that sequestration cuts would be only part of the limits on military spending. He noted that the Defense Department is now operating under a continuing resolution on its spending, and he estimated that total cuts in the last half of the fiscal year could reach $52 billion."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/world/asia/reformers-aim-to-get-china-to-live-up-to-own-constitution.html,"BEIJING — After the chaos of the Cultural Revolution, the surviving Communist Party leaders pursued a project that might sound familiar to those in the West: Write a constitution that enshrines individual rights and ensures rulers are subject to law, so that China would never again suffer from the whims of a tyrant.The resulting document guaranteed full powers for a representative legislature, the right to ownership of private property, and freedoms of speech, press and assembly. But the idealism of the founding fathers was short-lived. Though the Constitution was ratified in 1982 by the National People’s Congress, it has languished ever since.Now, in a drive to persuade the Communist Party’s new leaders to liberalize the authoritarian political system, prominent Chinese intellectuals and publications are urging the party simply to enforce the principles of their own Constitution.The strategy reflects an emerging consensus among advocates for political reform that taking a moderate stand in support of the Constitution is the best way to persuade Xi Jinping, the party’s new general secretary, and other leaders, to open up China’s party-controlled system. Some of Mr. Xi’s recent speeches, including one in which he emphasized the need to enforce the Constitution, have ignited hope among those pushing for change.A wide range of notable voices, among them ones in the party, have joined the effort. Several influential journals and newspapers have published editorials in the last two months calling for Chinese leaders to govern in accordance with the Constitution. Most notable among those is Study Times, a publication of the Central Party School, where Mr. Xi served as president until this year. That weekly newspaper ran a signed editorial on Jan. 21 that recommends that the party establish a committee under the national legislature that would ensure that no laws are passed that violate the Constitution.After the end of the party’s leadership transition last November, liberal intellectuals held a meeting at a hotel in Beijing to strategize on how to push for reform; constitutionalism was a major topic of discussion. At the end of the year, 72 intellectuals signed a petition that was drafted by a Peking University law professor who had helped organize the hotel meeting. In early January, a censored editorial on constitutionalism at the liberal newspaper Southern Weekend set off a nationwide outcry in support of press freedoms.Several people involved in the advocacy say their efforts are not closely coordinated, but that rallying around the Constitution was a logical first step to galvanize reform.“We have a common understanding that constitutionalism is a central issue for China’s reform,” said Zhang Qianfan, the law professor who drafted the petition. “The previous reform was preoccupied with economic aspects. But we learned from the experiences of the recent two decades that economic reform can go wrong if it’s not coupled with political reform, or constitutional reform actually.”Through the decades, party leaders have paid lip service to the Constitution, but have failed to enforce its central tenets, some of which resemble those in constitutions of Western democracies. The fifth article says the Constitution is the supreme authority: “No organization or individual may enjoy the privilege of being above the Constitution and the law.” Any real application of the Constitution would mean severely diluting the party’s power.It is unclear whether the latest push will be any more successful than previous efforts. A decade ago, a similar wave of advocacy failed to significantly alter the status quo, despite some initially encouraging words from Hu Jintao, the newly designated president at the time. The authorities admonished scholars who took part in seminars on the issue, and propaganda officials ordered the state news media not to publish articles on calls for constitutional government.Liberals have been encouraged by a speech that Mr. Xi gave on the 30th anniversary of the Constitution in which he said, “The Constitution should be the legal weapon for people to defend their own rights.” He added that implementation was needed for the document to have “life and authority.” Analysts say the speech, delivered Dec. 4, was much stronger than the one given by Mr. Hu on the Constitution’s 20th anniversary. And on Jan. 22, Mr. Xi said in a speech to an anticorruption agency that “power must be put in the cage of regulations.”But Deng Yuwen, an editor at Study Times, said he had so far only seen talk from Mr. Xi. “We have yet to see any action from him,” Mr. Deng said. “The Constitution can’t be implemented through talking.”And since taking power, Mr. Xi has appeared more concerned with maintaining party discipline than opening political doors. In remarks made during a recent southern trip that have circulated in party circles, Mr. Xi said China must avoid the fate of the Soviet Union, which broke apart, in his view, after leaders failed to stick to their socialist ideals and the party lost control of the military.In part, liberals advocating constitutional checks on power have been energized by the party’s takedown of Bo Xilai, the polarizing former Politburo member who is expected to be prosecuted soon on charges of corruption and subverting the law.One journal supported by reform-minded party elders, called Yanhuang Chunqiu, published a New Year’s editorial that said fully carrying out the Constitution would mean “our country’s political system will take a big step forward.”Wu Si, the journal’s editor, said in an interview that he expected the “heightened fervor” surrounding constitutionalism to persist “because there is more to the issue to discuss.”Rulers of modern China have never enforced a Constitution that enshrines the law as the highest authority and guarantees the rights of individuals. In the late 19th century, as the Qing dynasty waned, intellectuals who studied Western political systems, including Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei, lobbied rulers to transform China into a constitutional monarchy.In 1905, the Empress Dowager Cixi established a constitutional commission to search the world for political models to adopt. The Qing dynasty collapsed in 1911, and the Kuomintang government tried its hand at creating a constitution for the new republic, but nothing took hold.The Communist Party wrote several constitutions after taking power in 1949. The current version, which has been revised four times and had 13 amendments added, was overseen by Peng Zhen and Marshall Ye Jianying, two revered Communist leaders.In all those instances, rulers experimented with a constitution to bolster the power of the governing body, said Sam Crane, a political scientist at Williams College who specializes in China.“Constitutions were something that strong states had; therefore, China had to have one,” he said. “Thus, Chinese constitutions were not really effective in limiting state power and protecting individual liberties. That might be changing now.”Recent attempts by scholars looking to defend the legitimacy of the Constitution, he said, “might be due to the growth of ‘rights consciousness’ in the People’s Republic of China in recent years.”Advocates of constitutionalism say their approach should be more acceptable to the party than Charter ’08, an online petition calling for gradual political reforms that secured thousands of signatures but was banned by officials. One of its authors, Liu Xiaobo, was sentenced to 11 years in prison in 2009 for subversion, and his wife, Liu Xia, has been under house arrest. Mr. Liu was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize in 2010.Some party censors have reacted with caution or hostility to the recent calls for constitutionalism. In recent weeks, the term “constitutional governance” could not be searched on microblogs. And the petition organized by Mr. Zhang, which he prefers to call an initiative, has been scrubbed from many sites on the Internet.“I take it to mean that the government doesn’t want this to spread too far domestically,” Mr. Zhang said. “Perhaps they’re not ready yet.”Nonetheless, talk of constitutionalism has become daily fare on literati Web sites like Gongshiwang, a politics forum. Typical was a Jan. 24 essay posted on the site and wtitten by Liu Junning, a political scientist, who seized on Mr. Xi’s most recent remarks on “caging power” and traced the concept to the Magna Carta and the American Constitution. The essay had been originally published in the Chinese-language edition of The Wall Street Journal.“Constitutional governance is restricted governance,” Mr. Liu wrote. “It is to tame the rulers. It is to shut the rulers in a cage.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/world/americas/lino-oviedo-candidate-in-paraguay-dies-in-crash.html,"RIO DE JANEIRO — Lino Oviedo, a candidate in Paraguay’s presidential election and one of the country’s most polarizing political figures, was killed in a helicopter crash on Saturday night while returning from a rally in northern Paraguay, government officials said Sunday.The death of Mr. Oviedo, 69, opens new uncertainty in Paraguay, where President Fernando Lugo was ousted last year. After the authorities confirmed Mr. Oviedo’s death and called it an accident, officials in Mr. Oviedo’s party, the National Union of Ethical Citizens, immediately questioned whether he had been assassinated.Mr. Oviedo, a retired general who had led the Paraguayan Army, had a tumultuous political career. He initially gained prominence in 1989, when he helped topple Gen. Alfredo Stroessner, the dictator who ruled Paraguay for 35 years.Mr. Oviedo fled the country in 1999 — seeking exile first in Argentina and then in Brazil — after being charged with organizing an aborted coup in 1996 against Juan Carlos Wasmosy, who was then Paraguay’s president.The authorities also indicted Mr. Oviedo on charges of masterminding the assassination of Vice President Luis María Argaña, who was killed by gunmen outside Asunción, the capital, in March 1999. But after Mr. Oviedo returned to Paraguay in 2004 and served time in prison in connection with the coup plot, Paraguay’s Supreme Court absolved him of the various charges.He then took up a hard-charging political career, campaigning as a populist who nimbly used Guaraní, Paraguay’s widely-spoken indigenous language, in his speeches. He became known as the “bonsai horseman,” in a nod to his short stature, and came in third in the country’s last presidential vote, in 2008.Paraguay was officially commemorating Mr. Stroessner’s overthrow on Sunday, and some of Mr. Oviedo’s supporters questioned the timing of the helicopter crash, which also killed an aide and the pilot. The Paraguayan aviation authorities said the helicopter went down during a storm in northern Paraguay and said they would investigate the cause of the crash.“Twenty-four years ago today General Oviedo overthrew the dictatorship,” César Durand, a spokesman for Mr. Oviedo’s party, told Radio Ñanduti. “This is a message from the mafia,” he said, employing a blanket term often used by Paraguayans to refer to shadowy organizations involved in drug trafficking and the smuggling of pirated goods into neighboring Brazil.Mr. Oviedo’s chances of winning Paraguay’s presidential election, scheduled in April, appeared to be slim, political analysts said. According to recent polls, support for Mr. Oviedo remained in the single digits, placing him far behind the front-runner, Horacio Cartes, a banking and tobacco magnate.The election comes after a stretch of political turmoil in Paraguay in which the Senate hastily ousted Mr. Lugo from office in June. Mr. Lugo, a former Roman Catholic bishop, had ended six decades of one-party rule when he was elected, but he faced fierce opposition from lawmakers in his attempts to reduce Paraguay’s landholding disparities.If Mr. Cartes, 56, holds his lead, the presidency will return to the Colorado Party, which has long dominated Paraguay. Still, his campaign is facing questions over his business dealings. State Department diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks revealed allegations that a bank under Mr. Cartes’s control was involved in money-laundering in 2007.Mr. Cartes has denied those accusations, calling them “laughable rubbish.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/business/andre-cassagnes-etch-a-sketch-inventor-is-dead-at-86.html,"André Cassagnes, a French electrical technician who half a century ago invented Etch A Sketch, the mechanical drawing toy that has lately become an American political simile, died on Jan. 16 near Paris. He was 86.The Ohio Art Company, which makes Etch A Sketch, announced the death.A chance inspiration involving metal particles and the tip of a pencil led Mr. Cassagnes to develop Etch A Sketch in the late 1950s. First marketed in 1960, the toy — with its rectangular gray screen, red frame and two white knobs — quickly became one of the brightest stars in the constellation of midcentury childhood amusements that included Lincoln Logs and the Slinky.Etch A Sketch was inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame in Rochester in 1998; in 2003, the Toy Industry Association named it one of the hundred best toys of the 20th century. To date, more than 100 million have been sold.The toy received renewed attention in March, amid the 2012 presidential campaign, after Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney, described his boss’s campaign strategy heading from the primaries into the general election thus:“Everything changes,” Mr. Fehrnstrom said. “It’s almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and restart all over again.”The quotation, pilloried by Democrats and Republicans alike, was widely interpreted as an acknowledgment by the Romney campaign that its candidate had no fixed political ideology.The complete eradicability of an Etch A Sketch drawing is born of the toy’s simple, abiding technology.The underside of the screen is coated with a fine aluminum powder. The knobs control a stylus hidden beneath the screen; turning them draws the stylus through the powder, scraping it off in vertical or horizontal lines that appear on the screen as if by magic. (An early French name for the toy was L’Écran Magique, “Magic Screen.”)To erase the image, the user shakes the toy, recoating the screen with aluminum; tiny plastic beads mixed with the powder keep it from clumping.That is essentially all there is to an Etch A Sketch, and though the toy now comes in various sizes, shapes and colors, its inner workings have changed little since Mr. Cassagnes first touched a pencil to a powder-coated sheet on an otherwise ordinary day more than five decades ago.André Cassagnes was born in 1926 outside Paris and as a boy worked in the bakery his parents owned. As a young man, he took a job as an electrical technician in a factory that made Lincrusta, a deeply embossed covering applied to walls and other surfaces to mimic sculptural bas-relief.One day in the late ’50s, as was widely reported afterward, Mr. Cassagnes was installing a light-switch plate at the factory. He peeled the translucent protective decal off the new plate, and happened to make some marks on it in pencil. He noticed that the marks became visible on the reverse side of the decal.In making its faux finishes, the Lincrusta factory also used metallic powders; Mr. Cassagnes’s pencil had raked visible lines through particles of powder, which clung naturally to the decal by means of an electrostatic charge.Mr. Cassagnes spent the next few years perfecting his invention, which was introduced in 1959 at the Nuremberg Toy Fair. (Because the toy was patented by Arthur Granjean, an accountant working for one of Mr. Cassagnes’s early investors, Mr. Granjean is sometimes erroneously credited as the inventor of Etch A Sketch.)After Ohio Art acquired the rights to the toy for $25,000, Mr. Cassagnes worked with the company’s chief engineer, Jerry Burger, to refine its design. Where Mr. Cassagnes’s original had been operated with a joystick, the final version mimicked the look of the reigning household god of the day — the television set. It soon became the company’s flagship product.In later years, Mr. Cassagnes designed kites; by the 1980s, he was considered France’s foremost maker of competition kites, which can perform elaborate aerial stunts.Mr. Cassagnes’s survivors include his wife, Renée, and three children, Sophie, Patrick and Jean Claude, according to European news accounts.In the 1980s, Ohio Art introduced an electronic version of Etch A Sketch, which let users make animated drawings. But the mechanical version endures, buoyed by periodic appearances in movies like “Toy Story.”It has been taken up by fine artists, who, through planning, patience and extreme dexterity, have cajoled the device into rendering the Mona Lisa, Van Gogh’s “Starry Night” and a spate of minutely detailed original images.Ohio Art, which for decades manufactured Etch A Sketch at its home in Bryan, Ohio, moved production of the toy to China in late 2000. But in the wake of Mr. Fehrnstrom’s comment last year, the company delivered an emblematically American response:Though it continues to be made with its venerable red frame, Etch A Sketch now also comes in blue, for Democrats."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/nyregion/port-deal-pushed-by-menendez-could-also-benefit-ex-aide.html,"SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic — It turns out that the lucrative port security contract pushed by Senator Robert Menendez would enrich more than just a major benefactor.The contract could also benefit one of the senator’s former top aides, people connected to the deal said.Mr. Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, has pushed United States government officials to help enforce a contract that a company owned in part by one of his major donors, Dr. Salomon E. Melgen, has with the Dominican government, which has refused to honor it.A top executive at Dr. Melgen’s security company will be Pedro Pablo Permuy, a former national security adviser and senior legislative aide to Mr. Menendez, according to a cousin of Dr. Melgen. Mr. Permuy’s ties to the senator go back at least 20 years.Mr. Permuy did not respond to requests for interviews on Monday, but said in an e-mail that he was neither a board member nor an employee of the border security company.Dr. Melgen’s cousin, a lawyer named Vinicio Castillo Semán, held a news conference on Monday in Santo Domingo to defend the doctor and the senator and to argue for enforcement of the contract to provide extensive screening of cargo from ports in the Dominican Republic. Some Dominican business interests have opposed the deal, saying, among other criticisms, that Dr. Melgen lacks a background in port security and is trying to use his influence with Mr. Menendez to encourage the Dominican government to enforce the deal.“Dr. Melgen was criticized for not knowing anything about security,” Mr. Castillo said. “He went out and looked for people. He is being advised by people who do have to do with security, people like Permuy, who was vice minister of defense for Latin America.”Pressed on Mr. Permuy’s role, Mr. Castillo said Mr. Permuy “will run the operations.”A second person involved in the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, saying he did not want to compromise negotiations, also described Mr. Permuy’s role as integral.Mr. Permuy was deputy assistant secretary of defense for inter-American affairs during the Clinton administration. He worked for Mr. Menendez as a senior legislative aide from 1993 to 1995 and then as his national security adviser from 2001 to 2003.In 2010, he and Dr. Melgen held a fund-raising dinner in Maryland for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, which Mr. Menendez was then leading. Dr. Melgen was an important fund-raiser for the senator in his committee efforts that year.Tricia Enright, a spokeswoman for Mr. Menendez, said the senator had no knowledge of Mr. Permuy’s involvement in Dr. Melgen’s company until The New York Times raised a question on Monday.“The first he heard of Pedro’s involvement was today,” she said.Mr. Permuy’s LinkedIn profile shows that he helped write the senator’s homeland security legislation.The relationship between Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen is under scrutiny as the senator prepares to assume the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Mr. Menendez has acknowledged accepting free flights from Dr. Melgen in 2010, and recently reimbursed the doctor $58,000, saying he had failed to do so before because of sloppy paperwork.Aides to Mr. Menendez acknowledge that he pushed for the contract for Dr. Melgen’s company, but characterized it as nothing unusual, saying he regularly advocated for the interest of American companies abroad.The contract was originally written for a different company, which Dr. Melgen bought. His offices in Florida were raided last week by the Federal Bureau of Investigation in what appeared to be an inquiry related to Medicare fraud."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/middleeast/many-egyptians-fight-on-streets-to-restore-revolutions-goals.html,"CAIRO — As hundreds fled the advancing armored cars of riot police officers, Mohamed Mokbel ran forward.A veteran of two years of violent street protests, he pulled on his gas mask and charred protective gloves for another long night at his current vocation: throwing tear-gas canisters back at the riot police.“Whenever people lose hope, the clashes grow worse,” Mr. Mokbel, 30, said on a break from the fighting on Friday night outside the presidential palace. “But the people in power are still acting like there is no crisis, still firing more gas,” he said, “so I am going back in.”Two years after the ouster of President Hosni Mubarak, waves of increasingly violent street protests have decimated tourism, slashed foreign investment, increased poverty and dashed hopes of a return to stability. In the last two weeks, more than 50 people have died in the clashes. Egypt’s top general raised the specter of a “collapse of the state” if civilian leaders failed to restore order. And the interior minister warned that armed militias could take over if his forces gave way.But behind the mayhem bedeviling the new government are street activists like Mr. Mokbel, who first burst into politics around the time of the Arab Spring revolt against Mr. Mubarak and say they are still fighting for its democratic goals. Alienated from Egypt’s new Islamist leaders or their rivals in the opposition, street protesters have risen up again and again to check perceived grabs for power, whether by the interim military rulers, the elected president or his Islamist allies.Now, while elite politicians tussle over matters of ideology or provisions of the Constitution, street protesters like Mr. Mokbel say they are carrying on the fight that kindled the original revolt, a battle against Mr. Mubarak’s abusive and unaccountable security services. Two years later, they note, the security forces are still largely intact, and reports of torture, extortion and excessive force continue.The street war between protesters and the police presents a double-edged challenge to President Mohamed Morsi, a former leader of the Muslim Brotherhood who had been jailed without trial under Mr. Mubarak. Brotherhood leaders close to Mr. Morsi say he does not yet fully control the Interior Ministry. Its officers make no secret of their hostility to the Islamists, and Brotherhood leaders say that the new president is struggling to win the ministry’s trust in order to tame it.But many in the street have turned against Mr. Morsi in part because they believe that he has sided with the security forces. Activists like Mr. Mokbel say they fear that like the region’s secular dictators, Mr. Morsi may use the security police against his opponents as a tool of political power.“They are trying to build a new regime exactly like the old one, with all its disadvantages,” said Mr. Mokbel, an artist with a small and slender frame who, between battles, studies painting in a graduate program in one of Egypt’s top art schools.The protesters, Mr. Mokbel argued, are the ones defending the rule of law, standing up for their right to peaceful expression. With no personal gain, he said, they risk their lives for their cause, for one another, and for their many friends who have fallen. “We owe them something,” he said. “Not just a better economic situation, a government that deals with the people, that is not authoritarian or repressive.”Mr. Mokbel may be among the more articulate protesters. In the on-again, off-again battles with the riot police near Tahrir Square, the combatants are usually teenagers or even children who appear to live much of the time in the streets. Many seem animated by the sport of it, and ill-informed about the politics.But Mr. Mokbel, part of an older network of activists that is the backbone of the protests, praised the street children for their energy.“The street kids are the ones who have suffered the most at the hands of the police, and their demands are much lower — some dignity, respect from the police, a little better life economically,” he said. “They are just releasing their anger.”Although he acknowledged that some among the demonstrators inevitably provoke the riot police with stones or gas bombs, he nonetheless argued that police aggression caused all the fighting. “Police attacking protesters is what causes the chaos,” he said.Though a few police officers in other cities have been killed by gunfire, the protesters in Cairo have never been armed. Unlike the bullets and batons of the riot police, Mr. Mokbel argued, the protesters’ rock-throwing was mostly harmless against their opponents’ armor, helmets, and shields.“Even from the Molotov cocktails, not a single police officer has died,” Mr. Mokbel said. “We do not want to burn down a place that we will end up paying to rebuild.”Mr. Mokbel is the son of a government employee and grew up in a middle-class family. Like many unmarried Egyptians, he still lives with his parents here. And before the revolution, he said, he and his family dismissed politics as hopeless.These days it keeps him up at night. He sometimes has trouble falling asleep because he is constantly checking his iPhone for Twitter updates or text messages from protesters who might need his help in some new skirmish with the riot police.At any clash, he said, he knows he will find friends. “There are a lot of really strong relationships, friendships,” Mr. Mokbel said. “We have slept in the same places, been through the same things, been in a lot of crisis situations together.”Like many on the ground, Mr. Mokbel was briskly dismissive of the elite political opposition. “It does not represent the opinion of the street,” he said. Anyone who starts talking to the news media on behalf of the revolutionaries has left them, he said.And also like many others, Mr. Mokbel said he did not object to the Islamist ideology of Mr. Morsi or the Muslim Brotherhood. When Mr. Morsi and his Brotherhood allies won control of Parliament and then the presidency, Mr. Mokbel expected that, as former victims of the security forces, they would soon move to reform them.But now the Islamists’ apparent monopoly on power has turned activists cynical about Egypt’s young democratic process. Since Mr. Morsi’s decree temporarily suspending the power of the courts to challenge his decisions, violence around the country has escalated sharply. “When the regime smashes the judiciary against the wall, and uses the police as a tool of repression, who will conduct elections?” Mr. Mokbel asked. “If we wait for elections, what guarantees do we have?”Senior Brotherhood officials close to Mr. Morsi say moving too fast to reform the Interior Ministry might provoke an open revolt by the police at a time when public security is already fraying. Instead, after recent clashes with police officers killed dozens of civilians, Mr. Morsi publicly thanked the security forces for their work, and in certain cities expanded police powers.“We want to see at least a beginning of justice,” he said.And so last Friday Mr. Mokbel once again packed his gas mask and protective gloves into a shoulder bag and headed into the street for the inevitable fight.First he joined a march, to help protect it from a rumored Islamist ambush. Then he raced downtown to clashes along the Nile, but they quickly petered out.Finally, as he was resting his legs just after sunset in a bohemian cafe, a handful of provocateurs among the mostly peaceful crowd outside the palace hurled gas bombs over its walls, setting fire to a gatehouse.The police responded, as usual, with tear gas and, eventually, birdshot. “Of course the police have the right to defend the palace,” Mr. Mokbel said, heading into the fight. “But the tear gas doesn’t just target the people who threw the gas bombs. It is against the whole crowd.”“A lot of tear gas,” he said, smiling wanly after about two hours of racing through the smoke to try to throw back the canisters. “So there is enough for everyone.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/nyregion/bill-to-squelch-new-jerseys-jughandle-turns-is-backed.html,"It is the peculiar fate of the New Jersey driver, as indelible as a shoreside weekend or a Bruce Springsteen composition, if less easily romanticized.For when the denizens of Mr. Springsteen’s “Born to Run” take their hemi-powered drones for a scream down the boulevard, one detail is perhaps omitted: If ever those renegade drivers resolved to make a left turn, they probably suffered the indignity of taking a right-hand loop first.The loop is called a jughandle, a traffic formation that looks as it sounds: an unintuitive veer to the far right when you want to turn left.While other states have been known to use jughandles, none seems to have matched New Jersey in volume or reputation.After more than a half-century, though, the jughandle — so intertwined with the Garden State that it is also called a “Jersey left” — faces a threat. On Monday, a proposal to ban future jughandles cleared the State Senate’s transportation committee, allowing for a full vote and prompting a zealous debate over the state’s signature driving quirk.“I’m from New Jersey for 60 years,” said Daniel Gaskill, who operates the Princeton Driving School. “Jughandles are part of our culture.”Officials said construction of the state’s hundreds of jughandles dated to the 1940s and grew as part of an effort to keep traffic clusters off main drags. But like the state’s many traffic circles, the jughandle has become a polarizing force.The bill’s author, State Senator James Holzapfel of Toms River, described the minutes-long wait at a jughandle as “my personal hell.” Since 2003, when Mr. Holzapfel was an assemblyman, he has introduced a jughandle bill every two years. Monday was the first time his plan passed in a committee. “I’ve sat through three, four changes of the light before I could even get over the highway,” he said. “You sit there and say, ‘There’s got to be a better way.’ ”Officials with the State Transportation Department are not so sure, suggesting that the alternatives — dedicated turn lanes or mixed-use lanes — leave drivers vulnerable to backups in active travel lanes, including high-speed lanes.“We, as a department, have found that the jughandle design does serve a purpose,” said Tim Greeley, a department spokesman.A spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie did not respond to a message seeking the governor’s position on jughandles.Some residents have said the greatest shortcoming of the state’s turning policy is its inconsistency. Some stretches include traditional left turns and jughandles in proximity, leaving a left-leaning driver to guess which lane to enter. Mr. Holzapfel noted that roads by the state’s resort towns were particularly problematic to visitors unfamiliar with the convention.“They go to the intersection, stop, then try to make a left across a three-lane road,” he said.Mr. Holzapfel said that intersections once plagued with accidents and backups, including some on Routes 1 and 17, had been remedied in recent years with the use of overpasses and other designs that eliminated the need for jughandles. He estimated that jughandles had caused thousands of accidents. (If passed, the bill would affect the future construction of jughandles, not those that are already in place.)Maria Prato, 31, who moved from Oklahoma City to North Hanover, N.J., in 2007, said it took her about two weeks to figure out how to make a left turn. “I was like: ‘What is wrong with these people? They don’t need to make left-hand turns?’ ” she recalled. “Eventually one of the locals cued us in.”But perhaps no New Jerseyan has weighed the jughandle’s merits as thoroughly as Jason Didner, 42, a singer and songwriter. Years before he took a job with a highway construction company, he wrote a tune about his driving experience for “Car Talk” on National Public Radio.“My experience,” he said in a phone interview on Monday, “was seeing a diner on the left-hand lane, and you can’t get there for another 10 minutes.”And with that, Mr. Didner offered his entry, “You Can’t Get There From Here in Jersey,” and its chorus:“You can’t get there from here in Jersey/ You’re always on the wrong side of the road/ You can’t get there from here in Jersey/ I’ve got a case of jughandle turnaround overload.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/us/politics/john-mccain-opposes-filibuster-of-chuck-hagel.html,"WASHINGTON — Several Republican senators — notably John McCain — said Monday they would oppose a filibuster of former Senator Chuck Hagel’s confirmation as secretary of defense, moving the nominee much closer toward approval.“I just do not believe a filibuster is appropriate, and I would oppose such a move,” Mr. McCain, a key Republican on military issues, told reporters, adding that he would press his colleagues on the matter. Senators Richard M. Burr of North Carolina and Susan Collins of Maine also said Monday that they would reject a filibuster, as did Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri last week, pushing the number of votes to force confirmation beyond the 60 needed.Mr. McCain and the others cannot stop a single senator from blocking Mr. Hagel’s nomination from coming to an up-or-down vote, but his statement indicated what Senate Republican aides said Friday: In the event of a filibuster, Mr. Hagel almost certainly will have 60 votes. The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to send the confirmation to the full Senate on Thursday, most likely along party lines.The 53 Democrats and two independents who lean Democratic are expected to hold together for Mr. Hagel. Two other Republicans — Senators Mike Johanns of Nebraska and Thad Cochran of Mississippi — have come out for the confirmation of Mr. Hagel, a former Senate Republican from Nebraska.But on Monday, it became clear many Republicans did not have the stomach to filibuster a cabinet nomination, a move that may be unprecedented. To do so would take egregious circumstances, like ethical or legal violations, Ms. Collins said.“I’m not inclined to support a filibuster, regardless of how I ultimately come down” on a final vote, she said.Some Republicans believe Mr. Hagel’s most ardent opponents could still use procedural hurdles to block him. Senators Ted Cruz and John Cornyn, Republicans of Texas, have said they would not take any options off the table. That could slow Mr. Hagel’s path to the Pentagon, but with the new opposition to a filibuster, Mr. Hagel will almost certainly head the Defense Department."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/us/politics/in-minneapolis-obama-presses-case-for-tougher-gun-laws.html,"MINNEAPOLIS — President Obama traveled to the nation’s heartland on Monday to press his case for tougher national gun laws, even as he appeared to acknowledge that expanded background checks on gun sales were far more likely to pass Congress than a ban on military-style assault weapons.In a city once called “Murderapolis” for its homicide rate in the 1990s, the president cited successful gun-violence prevention efforts here as evidence that new national laws are needed to reduce the number of shootings across the country.“The only way we can reduce gun violence in this country is if the American people decide it’s important,” Mr. Obama said, standing in front of a sea of police officers and sheriff’s deputies at the Minneapolis Police Department Special Operations Center.Mr. Obama renewed his call for Congress to pass a series of measures, including a ban on the manufacture and sale of new assault weapons, limits on high-capacity magazines and an expansion of the criminal background check system that currently covers only about 60 percent of gun sales.But he openly demonstrated different expectations for the measures as Washington wages a bitterly divisive debate over the role of guns in society.The president declared “universal background checks” to be supported by a “vast majority of Americans” and called for their quick passage in Congress. “There’s no reason why we can’t get that done,” he told the gathering of law enforcement officials.But of the potential for a new assault weapons ban, the president said only that it “deserves a vote in Congress because weapons of war have no place on our streets.”On Monday, White House aides again said the president was still pushing for the three measures, along with changes to the nation’s mental health system. But the president, top lawmakers in Congress and gun-control advocacy organizations appear nervous about the political chances of the assault weapons ban and eager to push for a better background check system.“There definitely seems to be a significant convergence around the idea of universal background checks,” said Dan Gross, the president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, though he added, “I think there is still a significant outcry on the part of the American public to talk about assault weapons.”On Sunday, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said he might not even personally support an assault weapons ban, though he promised that senators would get a chance to vote on it. During the Super Bowl on Sunday, an important gun-control group broadcast a television advertisement in Washington focused exclusively on pushing for better background checks.The ad, from Mayors Against Illegal Guns, notes that the National Rifle Association once supported such checks. The ad concludes with a child saying: “America can do this. For us. Please.”The focus on background checks reflects a broad political calculation in Washington that there is more public support for requiring the checks than for limits on guns and ammunition. A recent New York Times/CBS News survey found that 92 percent of those polled backed broader background checks.The same survey found that 53 percent supported a ban on some semiautomatic weapons and that 63 percent would support limits on magazines.John Feinblatt, a top adviser to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, said it was “widely acknowledged” that an effective assault weapons ban would be a tougher fight. He compared the background check system to an airport that has two lines — one with security and one without.“That’s pretty much the system that we have,” Mr. Feinblatt said.But some advocates of tougher gun laws say that Mr. Obama and his allies in Congress should not give up pushing for the three measures, regardless of the opposition that the measures are likely to face from the N.R.A. and other gun rights groups.R. T. Rybak Jr., the mayor of Minneapolis, mocked politicians in Washington who are unwilling to support an assault weapons ban.“Oh, it’s not going to pass,” Mr. Rybak said. “Well, guess what? People are dying out here, and I’m not satisfied with the lame kind of response that we’ve gotten from some of the people in Washington who look at this like some kind of game.”Mr. Rybak, a Democrat, said he would not be satisfied by a compromise on gun control measures that did not address assault weapons and focused only on background checks.“I don’t think any of us should accept anything other than complete effort and knocking off the political wimpsmanship that I think too often takes place around these issues,” he said. “Get a spine. Get a backbone because people are losing their lives.”In the 1990s, Minneapolis experienced an explosion of drug- and gang-related violence, which led to a series of local measures aimed at reducing gun violence that has brought down the city’s murder rate.The city has developed programs directed at rehabilitating young people who have committed violent crimes, and its leaders are pushing for faster and more comprehensive state background checks for people buying guns.Janeé Harteau, the Minneapolis police chief, noted that violent crime persists, mentioning two children who were recently killed by stray bullets in the city. Mr. Obama cited the city’s overall success in reducing crime as proof that new laws could make a difference even if they could not eliminate the threat of all shootings.“When it comes to protecting our children from gun violence, you’ve shown that progress is possible,” Mr. Obama said. “We don’t have to agree on everything to agree that it’s time to do something. That’s my main message here today.”Aides said that Mr. Obama had met privately with law enforcement officials, as well as state and local political officials and community leaders responsible for those efforts Monday before his remarks.Among the officials Mr. Obama met were Gov. Mark Dayton, Mr. Rybak, Ms. Harteau and Richard Stanek, the sheriff of Hennepin County. Eric H. Holder Jr., the attorney general, also attended the meeting.Before the meeting started, Mr. Rybak praised the president.“We just have tremendous admiration for you carrying a tough political load,” the mayor said, adding, “we still need common-sense law changes in Washington.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/nyregion/celebrating-ed-koch-a-civic-savior-of-new-york.html,"After the eulogies by a mayor and a former president, after the loving references to “Uncle Eddie” by a 17-year-old grandnephew, after the coffin had been lifted on the shoulders of the Police Department’s ceremonial unit, the 10,000-pipe organ in Temple Emanu-El played a piece that is not usually heard at a funeral, but that seemed singularly appropriate for the funeral of Edward I. Koch: “New York, New York.”The song was written by John Kander and Fred Ebb in 1977, the year Mr. Koch was elected mayor, and as his coffin was carried down the center aisle and the organ swelled from pianissimo to full-fledged forte, the mourners broke into applause for the city’s 105th mayor. Mr. Koch died at 88 on Friday.“No mayor, I think, has ever embodied the spirit of New York City like he did,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told the mourners, “and I don’t think anyone ever will. Tough and loud, brash and irreverent, full of humor and chutzpah — he was our city’s quintessential mayor.”In the pews was a Who’s Who of the New York that Mr. Koch led for three terms — and the New York he commented on in the 23 years after he left office. The congregation was part familiar names, part lesser knowns who had worked in government, and part onetime adversaries who had tangled with Mr. Koch but seemed to have patched things up.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Koch had been so angry when he advised the mayor not to run for a fourth term in 1989 that Mr. Koch endorsed Mr. Schumer’s opponent, Alfonse M. D’Amato, an incumbent and a Republican, in 1998. As things turned out, Mr. Koch lost the Democratic primary to David N. Dinkins, who went on to defeat Rudolph W. Giuliani in the November election, and Mr. Schumer beat Mr. D’Amato.“I invited him to my swearing-in, and I said, ‘Let’s let bygones be bygones,’ ” Mr. Schumer said, “and we’ve been friends ever since.”Mr. Dinkins attended the service, as did former Mayor Giuliani, who as the United States attorney in Manhattan in the 1980s had pursued corruption cases that shook the Koch administration. But Mr. Koch was never implicated, and James F. Gill, a lawyer at a firm Mr. Koch joined after he was mayor, said Mr. Koch’s “most cherished possession was his reputation for honesty and integrity.”Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former President Bill Clinton chatted after the service. What they said is unknown, because reporters could not hear them. But as they parted, Mr. Cuomo, who was housing secretary in the Clinton administration, said, “Nice to see you, Bill.”He put out his hand, saying, “Tell Hillary I said hello.” Hillary Rodham Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state last week, is widely seen as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. So is Mr. Cuomo.Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said that Mr. Koch had frequently offered her advice, but that “at the end of every conversation he would say, ‘Just do what you want, and if people don’t like it, just bleep ’em.’ ”Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who lost to Mr. Koch in the 1977 mayoral voting but defeated him five years later in the Democratic primary for governor, also attended the service, as did former Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republican who defeated the elder Mr. Cuomo in 1994.Mr. Koch was remembered for his life before City Hall — as a congressman from Manhattan — and for his life after, as a movie reviewer, author and political gadfly. Some in the crowd seemed surprised that the service lasted little more than an hour.“We were told not to speak long,” Mr. Clinton said. He held up a bundle of papers as if it were the text of the eulogy he was about to give.He assured the mourners it was not. “These are the letters I got from Ed Koch when I was president,” he said, recalling advice Mr. Koch had given him, solicited and unsolicited, on domestic issues like gun control and on foreign policy.“He had a big brain,” Mr. Clinton said, “but he had a bigger heart.”Mr. Bloomberg said Mr. Koch had rescued the spirit of the city after its brush with bankruptcy and the disastrous summer of 1977, with the Son of Sam shootings and a blackout that was followed by looting. Mr. Bloomberg said that by the time he got into politics years later, Mr. Koch was ready with advice, drawing laughter at one example.“I remember the time we were talking about how to tackle obesity, and he said, ‘Limit the size of sugary drinks, no one will notice.’ ” (Mr. Bloomberg’s restrictions on large sodas, set to take effect next month, have aroused outrage in some quarters and are being challenged in court by the soft-drink industry.)Several of Mr. Koch’s relatives — the children and grandchildren of his sister, Pat Koch Thaler — delivered tributes, offering a glimpse of the private side of a public figure.Noah Thaler, Mr. Koch’s grandnephew, recalled a devoted uncle who had attended youngsters’ school events and soccer games, family holiday dinners, a Cirque du Soleil performance (where, he said, they ran into Mr. Clinton, and his proud Uncle Eddie bragged about him), even a manicure last year with Mr. Koch’s grandniece Hannah.Other relatives marveled at Mr. Koch’s ability to walk into one of their apartments, lie down on a couch and fall asleep instantly — and to wake up just as fast.“While he knew he was often portrayed as a lonely bachelor, it didn’t matter,” Mr. Thaler said. “He saw in his family only perfection.”Mr. Koch was buried at Trinity Church Cemetery in northern Manhattan. He chose it so that he would not have to leave Manhattan. “Just think about it: a Polish Jew in an Episcopal graveyard in a largely Dominican neighborhood,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “What could be more New York — or even more Ed Koch?”After the service, the coffin was lifted into a hearse on Fifth Avenue, which was closed, as were side streets near Temple Emanu-El.“The ultimate New York tribute — a traffic jam,” said Randall Bourscheidt, who was the deputy commissioner of cultural affairs in the Koch administration."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/us/politics/senate-to-revist-violence-against-women-act.html,"WASHINGTON — For all the attention on the Republican Party’s efforts to attract Latinos, the first test for the party on 2012’s lessons learned will arrive this week for a voting bloc that has drifted out of its grasp: women.Restarting a politically tinged debate, the Senate voted 85 to 8 on Monday evening to take up a renewal of the Violence Against Women Act. The measure foundered last year on Republican concern over obscure issues like the bill’s inclusion of additional visas for abused illegal immigrants, its treatment of same-sex couples and its strengthening of American Indian courts. Final Senate passage is expected by the end of the week — with broad, bipartisan support.That will leave House Republicans a stark choice: stand against the provisions that derailed the bill last year or adjust, given November’s electoral blowout with women. Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, practically pleaded with her party on Monday to move forward.“This is not and never should be a partisan political issue,” she said on the Senate floor. “This is an equal-opportunity crime that harms people regardless of their political affiliation, their profession or their status in life. It’s an issue that deserves bipartisan support.”House Republican leaders are struggling for a way forward. On Tuesday, Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, will meet with Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, to try to compromise on the biggest sticking point, a provision that would allow American Indian women assaulted on reservations by non-Indians to go to tribal courts, which have no jurisdiction over assailants who do not live on Indian land.Many Republicans see that as a dangerous and unconstitutional expansion of tribal court power, while victims’ advocates say women on reservations have virtually no recourse when raped by non-Indian interlopers.“On reservations and tribal lands, it’s open season on women,” said Kim A. Gandy, the president of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, an advocacy group pressing for passage of an expanded domestic violence law.But both sides concede the politics of the bill are clear.“Socially moderate, fiscally conservative women, we do everything we can to drag them away from our party by fighting over things we shouldn’t,” said Steven C. LaTourette, a moderate Ohio Republican who retired from the House last year. “The public only sees the headline, and the headline says, ‘Republicans clocking a bill called violence against women.’ ”In 2000, a year when the total vote for House candidates split 50-50 between the two parties, 54 percent of women voted for Democratic candidates. Two years later, that gender gap had evaporated.But in November last year, it had reopened wide. In a year when Republicans maintained control of the House, exit polls showed that 56 percent of women voted against their candidates, an even higher total than the 55 percent that voted for President Obama.“I do not believe Republicans can change their stripe on this,” said Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “They just can’t.”House Republican leadership aides said they were in serious negotiations with Senate Democrats, White House officials and tribal leaders on a way forward. Senate Democrats have already made the path clearer by dropping one contentious provision, which would have expanded the number of available visas for illegal immigrants who were victims of domestic violence. That provision, because of its slight cost and a modest fee, ran afoul of the constitutional mandate that tax measures originate in the House.Senator Patrick J. Leahy of Vermont, the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he would instead include the measure in a comprehensive immigration bill his committee planned to take up soon.Rather than introducing an anti-violence bill that would pass largely along party lines, as House Republicans did last year, House Republican leaders will move forward only after a compromise is reached, aides said.“Our focus is on passing a bill that protects women and prosecutes offenders — that’s always been our goal,” said Doug Heye, a spokesman for Mr. Cantor. “We have made clear that Dems last year were more interested in using this as a political issue against Republicans than finding a solution to the issues.”But the politics within the Republican Party are anything but resolved. Some Republicans still oppose using money set aside for domestic violence cases to aid victims in same-sex relationships. Last week, the conservative Independent Women’s Forum said the Violence Against Women Act, passed first in 1994, was a waste of money that could actually be intensifying domestic violence.“Although there is little credible evidence that V.A.W.A. programs are reducing the effects and occurrence of domestic and sexual violence, there is evidence that several of the policies instituted under V.A.W.A. may actually be harming the very victims they were designed to protect,” wrote Christina Villegas, a visiting fellow at the group.Fresh off their political victories, Democrats, if anything, may be less willing to compromise further. With a record number of women in the Senate and 60 co-sponsors of their version, including seven Republicans, Democrats are practically daring Republicans to stand in the way again.“We’re going to have these votes,” Mr. Leahy said. “The proof will be in the pudding.”“There’s no question that both parties have noticed the extremely important role that women voters played in the last election,” Ms. Gandy said. “You ignore women voters at your own peril.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/us/politics/bipartisan-house-plan-focuses-on-gun-trafficking.html,"WASHINGTON — Members of both parties in the House outlined a plan on Tuesday to stiffen penalties on the illegal purchase and transportation of guns, a rare show of agreement on an issue where bipartisanship has been scarce.Two Democrats and two Republicans in the House of Representatives have introduced legislation that would create a dedicated federal anti-gun-trafficking law while further cracking down on people who buy firearms for someone else and lie about it on federal background check forms.As the law is written now, “the penalties are so weak it’s like a slap on the hand,” said one of the bill’s sponsors, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York.Their proposal closely mirrors one already introduced in the Senate. That bill has bipartisan support as well, a fact that has heartened gun-control supporters on Capitol Hill.But even with new signs of greater bipartisan open-mindedness on gun control — the House majority leader, Representative Eric Cantor, Republican of Virginia,  signaled support on Tuesday for a stronger background check system — lawmakers acknowledged the hurdles they face in getting any bill through both houses of Congress.“For those who have deep concerns about the overreach of the federal government, I’m in that group,” Representative Scott Rigell of Virginia, a Republican sponsor of the measure, said as he tried to assuage concerns of those in Congress and across the country who are worried about a federal push to limit the right to bear arms.“To the extent that people slow down and take a look at it, read it — unless you’re a gun trafficker, unless you’re a person who’s a straw purchaser, there’s really no problem with this,” Mr. Rigell said.The debate over gun-control legislation has never broken down cleanly along partisan lines. And this pattern is especially evident now as a number of Senate Democrats from states like Alaska, Colorado, Montana and West Virginia face tough questions from constituents back home.But the unveiling of the House legislation on Tuesday showed the flip side of that dynamic. There are many House Republicans who represent affluent suburban areas where voters view gun control in less absolute terms and are generally more open to stricter laws. This includes Mr. Rigell, who represents an area around Virginia Beach, and Representative Patrick Meehan of Pennsylvania, another sponsor of the bill, whose district includes the north and west suburbs of Philadelphia.Mr. Meehan, who was on hand for the announcement on Tuesday, said he planned to begin reaching out to other Republicans soon. “We will begin the process of lining up the support of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle,” he said.Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, lost his 20-year-old nephew to gun violence in 2011 and is another sponsor of the anti-trafficking bill. When he spoke on Tuesday in support of it, he said Americans grieving everywhere were calling on Congress to act. “They are begging us to address this problem,” he said.The companion bill in the Senate is being sponsored by Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Democrat of New York, and Mark Steven Kirk, Republican of Illinois. Though it differs in some central ways from the House bill, it also would create a federal gun trafficking statute and strengthen penalties for lying on federal background check forms.That bill is competing with a number of other gun control measures in the Senate, including another one focused on curbing trafficking. Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat and the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, has a bill that would create a federal gun trafficking statute. But unlike the others, Mr. Leahy’s focuses more on the buyer of the guns rather than the seller. He does not yet have a Republican co-sponsor.Then there is the effort by Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California, to ban the sale and manufacture of 157 types of semiautomatic weapons, as well as magazines holding more than 10 rounds of ammunition. And a group including Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, is preparing legislation that would allow for a more stringent system of background checks for firearms buyers.Much of the agreement between Democrats and Republicans on gun control has been around strengthening background checks, and that has appeared to be the most likely prospect for approval early this year.But anti-trafficking laws enjoy broad support from law enforcement agencies because they would help tackle a huge problem for police forces in major cities. Because of the country’s patchwork gun laws, trafficking has enabled the spread of guns from places where firearm restrictions are relatively few, like in the South, to places where they are stricter, like New York City and California.President Obama, speaking before an array of law enforcement officials in Minneapolis on Monday, stressed the importance of such laws."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/us/essie-mae-washington-williams-secret-child-of-famous-father-dies-at-87.html,"Essie Mae Washington-Williams, who lived for decades with a stunning secret — that she was the interracial daughter of Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, a former segregationist who never acknowledged her publicly as his child — died Monday in a nursing home near Columbia, S.C. She was 87.Her death was confirmed by her lawyer, Frank K. Wheaton.Six months after her father died at age 100 as the longest-serving senator in history, Ms. Washington-Williams broke her silence.“My father’s name was James Strom Thurmond,” she said at a news conference in a hotel ballroom in Columbia on Dec. 17, 2003.She said she had remained silent out of respect for Mr. Thurmond, his career and the rest of his family. His death, and encouragement from her children, motivated her to speak out. She noted that there were similarities between her story and that of Sally Hemings, a slave with whom Thomas Jefferson bore children.“My children deserve the right to know from whom, where and what they have come,” Ms. Washington-Williams said. “I am committed in teaching them and helping them to learn about their past. It is their right to know and understand the rich history of their ancestry, black and white.”Measuring her emotions, Ms. Washington-Williams explained that her mother was Carrie Butler, a teenage maid in the Thurmond household in Aiken, S.C., in the 1920s, when Mr. Thurmond, the son of a wealthy lawyer, was in his early 20s. She would go on to say in interviews that not until she was 13 and being raised by an aunt did she learn that Ms. Butler was her mother. Several years later, after her mother took her to meet him for the first time, she learned that her father was white.“You,” he said to Ms. Butler, “have a lovely young daughter.”After that meeting, Mr. Thurmond, who did not yet hold elected office, delivered $200 to his daughter, using go-betweens.In 1948, the year Ms. Butler died at age 38, Mr. Thurmond, then the governor of South Carolina, ran for president on a segregationist platform.“All the bayonets of the Army cannot force the Negro into our homes,” he said at the time.While Ms. Washington-Williams’s 2003 announcement was a revelation for many people, many others had long understood Mr. Thurmond to have had an interracial child.He met with her many times while she was a student at South Carolina State University, a historically black college, and after she moved to Los Angeles, where she and her husband, a lawyer, raised her four children. He provided some financial support to her children, and wrote a letter of recommendation for her son to attend medical school. Ms. Washington-Williams said that she had visited his office in Washington many times and felt no bitterness toward him.“All of those on his staff knew exactly who I was,” she said in making her announcement.Ms. Washington-Williams sought no financial compensation. After her announcement, the Thurmond family quickly acknowledged the family link, and she met personally with at least two of her half-siblings, J. Strom Thurmond Jr., a former United States attorney in South Carolina, and Paul Thurmond, a Republican state senator.Essie Mae Washington was born on Oct. 12, 1925, in Aiken, S.C. She moved to Coatesville, Pa., as a young child and was raised by her aunt and uncle, whose name she took. She met her husband, Julius T. Williams, while both attended South Carolina State. In Los Angeles, she spent more than 30 years as a teacher and school administrator while her husband worked as a lawyer.Her survivors include two daughters, Monica Williams-Hudgens and Wanda Williams-Bailey; a son, Ronald; more than a dozen grandchildren; and several great-grandchildren; as well as her two half-brothers and a half-sister, Mr. Thurmond’s daughter, Juliana Whitmer. A son, Julius, and her husband both died before her.In 2004, a monument at the South Carolina State House was altered to add the name Essie Mae as one of Mr. Thurmond’s children. In 2005, she published a best-selling memoir, “Dear Senator: A Memoir by the Daughter of Strom Thurmond.”In that book, she recalled that Mr. Thurmond had required her to travel from California to Atlanta in later years to receive money. She also recalled his response when she sent him a Father’s Day card:“Dear Essie Mae, Thank you for your kind remembrance on Father’s Day. Affectionately, Strom Thurmond.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/nyregion/liu-fund-raiser-hospitalized-and-trial-postponed.html,"The trial of two allies of the New York City comptroller, John C. Liu, has been delayed, potentially until April, after one defendant was involuntarily committed and hospitalized, the judge said on Tuesday.Mr. Liu’s former campaign treasurer, Jia Hou, and a fund-raiser, Xing Wu Pan, were both scheduled to stand trial beginning this week in Federal District Court in Manhattan on charges of conspiring to funnel money to Mr. Liu’s campaign through an illegal campaign-finance scheme.But the judge, Richard J. Sullivan, said in court that Mr. Pan, a New Jersey real estate developer who is also known as Oliver, had been “involuntarily committed in connection with a mental health condition.”“He’s currently hospitalized,” the judge said, “and is undergoing treatment of an undetermined and potentially indefinite duration.”Irwin Rochman, a lawyer for Mr. Pan, told the judge he had spoken with Mr. Pan and found him to be coherent. “We’ve seen no diminution in his ability to understand and communicate with us,” Mr. Rochman said.The trial has been widely anticipated because it follows an exhaustive investigation into the campaign finances of Mr. Liu, a Democrat, who is likely to run for mayor, and who has not been charged with wrongdoing.A delay that pushes the trial into April could prove to be a distraction for Mr. Liu as the campaign heats up.The judge said that he had directed a court officer to ask Mr. Pan’s doctors for more details about his condition. He said that he also wanted their opinion on whether Mr. Pan would be competent to stand trial, and if so, whether his treatment needs could interfere with his ability to assist in his defense.Judge Sullivan indicated he might also appoint an expert to examine Mr. Pan. There appeared to be a possibility that the trial could start later this month, but the judge set April 15 as a fallback option.Mr. Pan’s lawyers would not elaborate after the hearing on where he had been hospitalized or about his condition. “Are we concerned about our client? Yes,” Mr. Rochman said. “He’s a human being in distress.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/us/colorado-gun-control-proposals-face-fight.html,"DENVER — Democratic lawmakers in Colorado, a state haunted by two of the worst mass shootings in American history, unveiled a broad package of gun-control measures on Tuesday, but they stopped short of proposing a ban on assault rifles or any other types of firearms.Standing with a tearful tableau of family members whose relatives were killed at Columbine High School and an Aurora movie theater, both in Colorado, and Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., the lawmakers offered a preview of legislation that is likely to face fierce opposition from Republicans and skepticism from some rural Democrats in a state where hunting and sport shooting are pursuits that cross generations and partisan lines.Colorado has emerged as a crucial stage for the battle over gun-control legislation. A national gun-control group has hired a lobbying firm here, and the president of the National Rifle Association is due to meet with Colorado’s governor this week to make his case.Under the Democrats’ proposals, all private gun sales would be subject to background checks. Colorado now requires background checks at gun shows and retail stores, but not for private sales between individuals. The lawmakers also would limit ammunition clips to 10 rounds, banning the 30-round and 100-round magazines that a gunman used last summer in the shooting inside the Century 16 movie theater in Aurora.And Democrats would make dealers and manufacturers of assault rifles liable for deaths or injuries caused by those guns, potentially stripping away some legal protections that have made gun makers immune from civil lawsuits brought by cities and family members of victims. That proposal could be trumped by a 2005 federal law that protects gun dealers and makers from civil actions.Even with Democrats now in control of the governorship and both houses of the Legislature, supporters of the gun measures said a bruising political battle lay ahead. “It will be a fight,” said State Representative Rhonda Fields, a Democrat from Aurora whose son Javad was shot to death in 2005.Rumblings of that fight showed themselves quickly at the news conference where the measures were announced. As lawmakers answered questions about whether farmers and ranchers who want to sell one another guns across a fence would have to submit to a background check (they would), Dudley Brown, a staunch gun-rights advocate, muttered, “It’ll make them felons.”State Senator Greg Brophy, a Republican, listened from the back of the ornate Capitol chamber with quiet incredulity. He said universal background checks would be nearly impossible to enforce without requiring every gun in the state to be registered. And he said holding Glock or Bushmaster responsible for the actions of killers was akin to blaming Coors for drunken-driving accidents.“They offer up a series of extreme measures that don’t make people safer,” he said, before acknowledging that Republicans probably did not have the votes to stop them. “They’re going to railroad the bills through. The question is, where’s Governor Hickenlooper?”Gov. John W. Hickenlooper, a first-term Democrat, has advocated background checks on all gun sales. But he has not endorsed more contentious measures like limiting ammunition magazines or imposing strict liability standards on gun makers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/us/politics/obama-slow-to-reveal-secrets-on-targeted-killings.html,"WASHINGTON — Early in his first term, President Obama rejected the vehement protests of the Central Intelligence Agency and ordered the public disclosure of secret Justice Department legal opinions on interrogation and torture that had been written in the administration of George W. Bush.In the case of his own Justice Department’s legal opinions on assassination and the “targeted killing” of terrorism suspects, however, Mr. Obama has taken a different approach. Though he entered office promising the most transparent administration in history, he has adamantly refused to make those opinions public — notably one that justified the 2011 drone strike in Yemen that killed an American, Anwar al-Awlaki. His administration has withheld them even from the Senate and House intelligence committees and has fought in court to keep them secret, making any public debate on the issue difficult.But with the disclosure on Monday of a Justice Department document offering a detailed legal analysis of the targeted killing of Americans, the barricades of secrecy have been breached. Just as leaks of interrogation memos in 2004 under President Bush ignited a fierce public debate over torture, the report on the so-called white paper by NBC News instantly touched off a renewed, and better informed, public discussion about whether and when a president can order the execution of a citizen based on secret intelligence and without any trial.The Justice Department prepared the white paper, an unclassified, 16-page document, to brief Congressional oversight committees in lieu of providing lawmakers with the far longer, classified memorandum that justified the killing of Mr. Awlaki, a New Mexico-born Sunni Muslim cleric who joined Al Qaeda’s branch in Yemen and died in an American drone strike there in September 2011. But the paper dovetails with the legal arguments in that still-secret document, as described to The New York Times in October 2011 by people who have read it.In short, the Justice Department argued that it was lawful for the government to kill an American citizen if “an informed, high-level official” decided that the target was a ranking figure in Al Qaeda who posed “an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States” and if his capture was not feasible. While the administration’s basic legal conclusions had already been aired — including in speeches by Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. and other officials — the white paper provided a far more detailed legal justification.Some human rights groups dismissed it in language reminiscent of their critiques of the Bush administration’s legal opinions on torture, taking particular aim at its flexible definition of what might constitute an “imminent” threat and the lack of any outside check on its claimed authority.The American Civil Liberties Union called the paper “chilling.” A spokeswoman for Amnesty International said there was increasing evidence that American practices were “unlawful, violating the fundamental human right not to be arbitrarily deprived of one’s life.”But Matthew Waxman, a Columbia University law professor who worked on detainee affairs in the Bush administration, defended the reasoning as “careful and narrow,” saying it was limited to cases in which “there are no viable alternatives.”“I see a very serious and reasonable effort to translate traditional legal principles to account for the context of this war,” he said.The Times, which is pursuing a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit to obtain the Awlaki memo, in December filed a separate request under that act for the unclassified white paper after it was discussed in a Congressional letter. On Jan. 23, the administration declined to disclose it, portraying it as a “draft” and citing an exemption for documents that are part of the executive branch’s “deliberative process.”Yet on Tuesday, Jay Carney, the White House spokesman, pressed by reporters to explain why the Obama administration would not release the classified Awlaki memorandum, suggested that reporters should be satisfied with the now-leaked white paper, in addition to speeches by administration officials.“I think the discussions that you’ve seen in public, including in the white paper, have to do with general principles that are applied on this important matter,” Mr. Carney said, adding, “The fact of the matter is that the white paper that we’ve discussed was provided — was developed and produced in an unclassified manner precisely so that those general principles could be spelled out and elaborated.”While Mr. Carney conceded that the government still had not officially disclosed even the white paper, he noted that it was now “online.”Separately on Tuesday, when asked why the Bush memos could be released while the Obama memos were withheld, Mr. Holder suggested cautiously that it might be possible to make more material public.“We’ll have to, you know, look at this and see how — what it is we want to do with those memos,” he said, while also noting “a real concern” about revealing information that could “put at risk the very mechanisms that we use to try to keep the American people safe, which is our primary responsibility.”While lawmakers on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees had seen the white paper, several used the disclosure to renew their call for the administration to lift its veil of secrecy.Both Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Democratic chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, and Representative Mike Rogers of Michigan, the Republican chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said the administration should give their committees the full opinion. Mr. Rogers said he agreed with the rationale for killing Mr. Awlaki, but called it “a bit ridiculous” that the memo had been withheld from lawmakers.Senator Ron Wyden, Democrat of Oregon, said that while there were “clearly” some circumstances in which the president could order strikes on Americans, the government should make public more details of the standards it uses in making such decisions so there could be debate on “whether the president’s power to deliberately kill American citizens is subject to appropriate limitations and safeguards.”Some legal scholars said Tuesday that the Justice Department document does not provide enough information to permit a full assessment. Officials have said the Awlaki memorandum includes about 30 pages describing intelligence said to link him to attacks. But the white paper lacks such context for its analysis.Steve Vladeck, an American University law professor who specializes in national security issues, said the discussion engendered by the document obtained by NBC bolstered the case for disclosing the real memo.“The more general the justification, the less convincing it is going to be,” he said. “So the ultimate problem with the white paper is that it cannot do what it needs to do, which is explain why in the case of Awlaki the United States government thought it literally did not have a choice.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/nyregion/lawmaker-compares-cuomos-law-making-methods-to-hitlers.html,"ALBANY — A Republican state assemblyman unhappy with the way Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo pushed the Legislature to approve strict new gun laws said Tuesday that Hitler and Mussolini would have been proud of the governor’s actions.The comments, by Assemblyman Steven F. McLaughlin of the capital region, were immediately rejected by legislative leaders of both parties. Hours later, Mr. McLaughlin apologized for his statement.The stir began when Mr. McLaughlin spoke at a morning news conference where Republican legislators were describing a proposal to amend the State Constitution to prevent the kind of late-night voting that occurred last month during debate over the gun measure on the first full day of the legislative session.The Legislature has often voted on controversial proposals in the middle of the night; the gun measure was also expedited by Mr. Cuomo’s decision to allow the Legislature to bypass the three-day waiting period that is otherwise required between the introduction of legislation and a vote.“We’re told basically to shut up and vote, and that’s what this is all about,” Mr. McLaughlin said. “Just don’t question it, just vote. That’s basically the message here. If that’s not dictatorial, I don’t know what is.“Hitler would be proud. Mussolini would be proud of what we did here. Moscow would be proud, but that’s not democracy.”Asked by a reporter about the appropriateness of his comments, including his mention of Hitler, Mr. McLaughlin said he stood by what he said.“How does Putin act over in Russia?” he said. “Same thing. Dictate to the Legislature what they’re going to do. They’re rubber-stamping it. I’m not calling the governor a dictator; I’m saying that this was the dictatorial thing to do.”On Tuesday afternoon, Mr. McLaughlin released a video message in which he expressed regret for his comments, explaining that “sometimes, in the heat of the moment, you say things that you regret, and that’s what happened today.”“I made an analogy that I should not have made, and I’m very, very sorry about that,” he added. “I’ve called the governor to apologize. He did not deserve that.”The lawmakers’ proposal to curb expedited voting — one element of which Republicans floated last year after Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, pressed for another late-night vote — would limit the governor’s ability to waive the constitutionally required three-day waiting period before lawmakers could vote on legislation. It would also restrict the Legislature’s consideration of bills between midnight and 8 a.m.The Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, immediately condemned Mr. McLaughlin’s comment.“That comparison is highly offensive and beneath a member of the State Legislature,” a spokesman for Mr. Silver, Michael Whyland, said in an e-mail. “It is completely inappropriate and doesn’t belong in our public discourse.”The Senate Republican leader, Dean G. Skelos of Long Island, also rejected the comments.“As I reflect back, perhaps we did act in haste,” Senator Skelos told reporters. “But I also think that that type of language is inappropriate.”The gun measures approved by lawmakers include a significant expansion of the state’s ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, as well as requirements to keep firearms away from people with mental illnesses and to impose stiffer penalties on gun crimes."

Many voters expected his election to be followed by immediate financial relief and a turnaround in relations with Russia.On Monday came the news that Russia would dispatch teams of sanitary inspectors to Georgia in anticipation of resuming imports. Georgian wine and mineral water — Russian consumer staples since the Soviet era — were banned from Russian shelves in 2006, as Mr. Saakashvili openly challenged Russia’s supremacy in the region. At a news conference marking his first 100 days in office on Tuesday, Mr. Ivanishvili said he was making headway in repairing the rift.“It will not happen as fast as I used to say,” he said. But he said that he felt a friendly tone was returning to the relationship, and that Russian officials had given him “a surprisingly warm reception” at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos.Mr. Saakashvili and his allies have warned that Mr. Ivanishvili’s overtures may represent a departure from Georgia’s longstanding efforts to join NATO and the European Union, which still have strong public support. Late last month, legislators from Mr. Saakashvili’s United National Movement proposed amending the country’s Constitution to make Georgia’s “pro-Western orientation” legally binding.Mr. Ivanishvili said Tuesday that he would not amend the Constitution, but that altering the country’s pro-Western foreign policy was “unimaginable.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/nyregion/first-part-of-hurricane-sandy-aid-is-to-be-released.html,"Federal officials plan on Wednesday to release the first installment of a nearly $51 billion emergency aid package to help millions of victims of Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast.That installment will total $5.4 billion, with New York City receiving $1.77 billion; New York State, $1.71 billion; New Jersey, $1.82 billion; and Connecticut, Maryland and Rhode Island splitting the rest, Senator Charles E. Schumer said.A formal announcement is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday on Staten Island, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg expected to be joined by Shaun Donovan, the Obama administration’s housing secretary, among others.“With this initial allocation, the work it took to pass the Sandy aid bill is starting to pay off,” Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said. “We know there is desperate need and anxious waiting in the places hit by the storm. We will be making sure that this money gets to homeowners, small businesses and communities as quickly as possible.”The disbursement will come a week after Congress gave final approval to the aid package, following a heated and prolonged battle. Indeed, Mr. Donovan said in an interview that the allocation, which usually takes up to 60 days, was the fastest in history.“The president has made clear to me and all of us across the administration that we have to move as quickly as we possibly can to get these funds to families and communities that are still struggling,” he said. “But we also have to do it with great transparency and accountability.”The House had initially declined to act on the bill amid objections from fiscal conservatives over its size and its impact on the federal deficit. But Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, among others, criticized his fellow Republicans for impeding an emergency response that, in past disasters like Hurricane Katrina, had much faster federal action.In the end, Congress did pass the $51 billion package, largely along party lines, supplementing a $10 billion measure that had been approved earlier and that primarily addressed flood insurance.The money being announced on Wednesday will come in the form of Community Development Block Grants, which are the biggest component of the aid package and are intended to give localities more flexibility in allocating resources. Next to individual assistance grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which are much smaller in size, these block grants are the most direct form of aid for people and businesses hurt by a natural disaster.The state and city are now drafting formal plans to be submitted in the next couple of weeks to the federal government detailing how they intend to spend the money. But the plans are likely to include awards to homeowners to repair and renovate homes and reimburse business owners who sustained heavy losses."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/us/politics/us-voting-flaws-are-widespread-study-shows.html,"WASHINGTON — The flaws in the American election system are deep and widespread, extending beyond isolated voting issues in a few locations and flaring up in states rich and poor, according to a major new study from the Pew Charitable Trusts.The group ranked all 50 states based on more than 15 criteria, including wait times, lost votes and problems with absentee and provisional ballots, and the order often confounds the conventional wisdom.In 2010, for instance, Mississippi ranked last over all. But it was preceded by two surprises: New York and California.“Poor Southern states perform well, and they perform badly,” said Heather K. Gerken, a law professor at Yale and a Pew adviser. “Rich New England states perform well and badly — mostly badly.”A main goal of the exercise, which grew out of Professor’s Gerken’s 2009 book, “The Democracy Index,” was to shame poor performers into doing better, she said.“Peer pressure produces horrible things like Britney Spears and Justin Bieber and tongue rings,” Professor Gerken said. “But it also produces professional peer pressure.”The project includes an interactive tool that allows rankings by individual criteria or clusters of them.Some states, for instance, lost very few votes because of shortcomings in voting technology and voter confusion, with the best 10 reporting failure rates of 0.5 percent or less in 2008. In West Virginia, by contrast, the rate was 3.2 percent.Natalie Tennant, West Virginia’s secretary of state, said she was not happy with that result and would look closely at Pew’s data and methodology. But she added that “2012 went really well, even with Sandy,” referring to the hurricane that disrupted early voting. “We were humming,” she said.“You’re only as good as your next election,” she added.The Pew study focused on the 2008 and 2010 elections, the most recent ones for which comprehensive data were available.The study also found wide variation in how easy registering to vote can be. North Dakota does not even require it, and Alabama and Kansas reported rejecting less than 0.05 percent of registration applications in 2008. But Pennsylvania and Indiana each rejected more than half of the registration applications they received in 2010.On Election Day, the voting experience can also vary. The 10 states with the shortest waiting times at the polls in 2008 averaged six minutes, the study found. In South Carolina, the wait was more than an hour.The shift to voting by mail, which now accounts for some 20 percent of all ballots cast, tends to eliminate lines. But it has also produced new problems, especially in places where mail voting has soared because the state does not require an excuse or a new ballot request for each election. Arizona and California, where voting by mail is commonplace, had among the highest rates of problems with voter registration and absentee ballots.In 2010, California rejected absentee ballots 0.7 percent of the time, a higher rate than any other state.Dean C. Logan, the registrar for Los Angeles County, said the rate was partly a byproduct of the popularity of voting by mail in California and partly a function of how the state defines rejected ballots. Its definition includes ballots that voters requested but that the Postal Service returned to election officials as undeliverable.“Voter behavior is changing and evolving,” Mr. Logan said. Young people do not sign their names as consistently as older ones, he said, and mail delivery is becoming less reliable.He also cautioned that statewide results can mask the fact that “the elections process is extremely decentralized.”Colorado, where some 70 percent of voters cast their ballots by mail in 2012, rejected absentee ballots 0.4 percent of the time in 2010.Pam Anderson, the clerk of Jefferson County, Colo., defended that rejection rate. “It’s not 10 percent, and it’s not zero,” she said. “We do a very rigorous signature verification process.”Charles Stewart III, a political scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a Pew adviser, said that high provisional ballot rates were an important signal of potential trouble.“Nationwide, a bit over 1 percent of voters are given a provisional ballot,” he said. “In Arizona in 2008, the rate was 6.5 percent. In the battleground state of Ohio, it was 3.6 percent. While these numbers may seem small, in a recount or election dispute, they would be huge.”In both 2008 and 2010, Arizona had the highest rate of rejected provisional ballots, though the rate dropped to 0.8 percent in 2010 from 1.9 percent in 2008.Tammy Patrick, an elections official in Maricopa County, Ariz., said that last year “65 percent of people voted by mail, which is grand.”Ms. Patrick said that voting by mail gave voters the benefit of convenience, and also the ability to reflect on their choices. “We have a fairly long ballot,” she said, “and this allows the voter a full month to vote that ballot.”But the trend also led to problems, Ms. Patrick said, partly as a result of grass-roots misinformation about whether and how such votes would be counted.Many people voted by mail and nonetheless turned up at polling places just in case, where they would often cast provisional ballots. “We had a 20 percent increase in our provisional ballots over all,” Ms. Patrick said, and many of those ballots were rejected.She said that the Pew data reflected “a piece of what we do,” but that the local political culture also played a role. “Arizonans don’t feel their elected officials represent them,” she said. “They don’t participate in their neighborhoods and civic activities. There’s a detachment in the sprawl.”Professor Gerken said that other cultural factors may affect voting rates. “States in the Deep South with high obesity problems seem to be having a problem getting people to the polling place,” she said.Absentee ballots from members of the military and Americans living overseas were also rejected at varying rates, the study found. In 2010, New York rejected a quarter of the 22,000 such ballots it received. Pennsylvania rejected just 2 percent of the 8,000 ballots it received.Professor Stewart said the study should focus attention on the infrastructure of democracy.“Among all important areas of public policy, election administration is probably the most episodic and prone to the problem of short attention spans,” he said. “What would the world be like if we only gave intense attention to education, corrections, transportation and public health problems for a one-week period every four years?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/world/europe/berlusconis-brother-uses-slur-for-mario-balotelli.html,"ROME — It was considered a coup, politically as well as athletically, when Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister, shelled out 20 million euros last month to land Mario Balotelli, the star striker, for his soccer team, A. C. Milan. But some of the bloom was lost this week when Paolo Berlusconi, the brother of the former prime minister, referred to Mr. Balotelli in loose translation as “the little black boy,” using a word that is clearly derogatory in Italian.“He’s a crazy guy,” Mr. Berlusconi said of Mr. Balotelli, who was born in Italy to African parents, speaking on Sunday at a campaign rally for his brother’s People of Liberty party outside Milan.The remarks, captured on video, would easily have caused a national firestorm in the United States and elsewhere. Tellingly, perhaps, they attracted little attention in the Italian news media, even though Italy has a growing problem with attitudes toward its expanding immigrant population.“I think people use discriminatory language very freely here,” said Carlotta Sami, the executive director of Amnesty International in Italy, which has called on Italian politicians to make human rights a campaign issue. “Italy is a country that hasn’t yet come to terms with the integration of foreigners and people of color.”Last month, the players of A. C. Milan walked off the field in solidarity after their teammate, Kevin-Prince Boateng, a German-Ghanaian midfielder, kicked a ball into the stands during an exhibition match after supporters of the rival team started shouting racist chants. At the time, Silvio Berlusconi said that his team would not tolerate racism.“These uncivil episodes, these catcalls and defamatory chants now occur with excessive frequency and offend soccer and all of sports,” the former prime minister said then.Mr. Balotelli, 22, was born in Palermo to Ghanaian parents and later adopted by an Italian family outside Milan. While at Manchester City, and before that at Inter, A. C. Milan’s crosstown rival, he was known for his temper and his appearances in the tabloid press. But he is also a hugely popular player, who plays for the national team and has earned the nickname Super Mario.Indeed, even as Paolo Berlusconi cheerfully derided Mr. Balotelli, his arrival at A. C. Milan was seen as a deft campaign move by the former prime minister, who harbors dreams of a comeback.Mr. Berlusconi, whose first party, Forza Italia, was named after a soccer cheer, has denied that the acquisition was politically motivated, but Mr. Balotelli has become an essential part of a populist campaign that has dominated the Italian airwaves before national elections scheduled for Feb. 24 and 25.Not long after the acquisition, Mr. Berlusconi said that Mr. Balotelli had scored two goals against Germany in a European Cup match last summer, while the caretaker Prime Minister Mario Monti — also sometimes nicknamed Super Mario — had not had such an effect.Political analysts have speculated that if A. C. Milan wins more games, die-hard fans of Mr. Berlusconi will be excited enough to bestir themselves and vote for him. That could help his People of Liberty party win in the important Lombardy region, where it is backing a candidate for regional president from the Northern League party, known for its anti-immigrant stance.Although the center-left Democratic Party is leading in polls, analysts say that if the center-right wins Lombardy, a powerful swing region, the left may fail to have a majority in the Senate, where seats are assigned based on regional showings.A. C. Milan, which is a member of Italy’s top Serie A league, did not respond to an e-mail request for comment."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/opinion/the-questions-brennan-cant-dodge.html,"SOUTH BEND, Ind.AT his confirmation hearing today, John O. Brennan, President Obama’s nominee to lead the Central Intelligence Agency, is likely to face tough questions on a host of topics, including the soaring use of drone strikes, which have killed at least four Americans, one of them intentionally; his performance as the president’s counterterrorism adviser; the rise of Islamist radicalism in northern Africa; and his past comments on engagement with Iran.The senators should also hold Mr. Brennan to account for one of the administration’s gravest failings: its refusal to openly discuss the legal basis for America’s campaign of targeted killings of terrorism suspects, including Anwar al-Awlaki, the American citizen and radical imam who was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in September 2011.We learned this week, thanks to reporting by NBC News, of a 16-page, unsigned, undated Justice Department “white paper” that outlines the Obama administration’s legal reasoning about targeted killing. The paper asserts that the government may lawfully kill a United States citizen if “an informed, high-level official” decides that the target is a high-ranking Qaeda figure or affiliate who poses “an imminent threat of violent attack against the United States” and that capturing him is not feasible.The paper’s sweeping claims of executive power are audacious. For a threat to be deemed “imminent,” it is not necessary for a specific attack to be under way. The paper denies Congress and the federal courts a role in authorizing the killings — or even reviewing them afterward. In doing so, it cites the authorization of force that Congress granted to President George W. Bush after 9/11.Yesterday, the White House suddenly agreed to let the two Congressional committees on intelligence see classified legal “advice” related to the white paper — a good but insufficient step. The administration should fully release the 2010 classified memorandum that was the basis for the unclassified, leaked white paper.I was struck to find my name on Page 4 of the white paper, which summarized my argument that “the conflict between the United States and Al Qaeda cannot lawfully extend to nations outside Afghanistan in which the level of hostilities is less intense or prolonged than in Afghanistan itself.”The lawyers dismissed my view, arguing that “there is little judicial or other authoritative precedent” on the issue, since the nation is fighting a “transnational, non-state actor” where the “principal theater of operations” is not in a country in conflict with America.These are more than legal quibbles.When Hellfire missiles were first used in drone strikes to kill outside a combat zone — in Yemen, in 2002 — six men died, including an American. A United Nations special rapporteur declared the action unlawful, but C.I.A. drone attacks have increased substantially since then: the Bureau of Investigative Journalism, a nonprofit news organization in London, estimates the number of persons killed in drone attacks at 3,000 to 4,500, including well over 200 children.Today, the United States is involved in a true armed conflict only in Afghanistan. Yet drone attacks have been carried out in Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan and may soon begin in Libya, Mali and Nigeria. None of these countries have attacked America, so no right of self-defense can be invoked under the United Nations Charter, as the white paper asserts.The Bush administration memos that attempted to justify torture, indefinite detention and illegal wiretapping have been widely rejected. How, then, can Mr. Brennan and other advisers to Mr. Obama (a former lecturer on constitutional law) condone this spurious effort to justify targeted killings?Terms like “armed conflict,” “combat” and “battlefield” are integral to the proper functioning of human rights law and international humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions. Such definitions are well established and can no more be tampered with to suit the administration’s preferences than can the definition of torture. Sadly, the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which under Mr. Bush drafted the notorious memo that narrowly construed torture as severe pain causing “organ failure, impairment of bodily function, or even death,” has now, under Mr. Obama, drafted the targeted-killings document.The white paper cites a 2010 speech by Harold H. Koh, the State Department’s top lawyer and a former dean of Yale Law School. He once testified that the main Bush-era torture memo was “perhaps the most clearly erroneous legal opinion I have ever read.” Having read the white paper, I think it’s a tossup.Targeted killings are, of course, different from torture: the C.I.A.’s “enhanced interrogation techniques” were largely kept secret until the so-called torture memos came to light. But the launching of Hellfire missiles and the dropping of 500-pound bombs, even in remote rural areas, can hardly be kept secret.Putting aside whether the targeted killings are even effective, the law must take precedence. Outside of armed conflict zones, the killing of innocent bystanders cannot be tolerated. The Justice Department has concocted an elastic definition of necessity — attempting to justify force in the absence of an immediate lethal threat — without citing any treaty or decision by an international court.Members of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence have a duty to interrogate Mr. Brennan on all of these issues — not just the attacks but the legal pretexts for them. They should also demand the full, public release of all the legal analyses behind targeted killings.“Secret law” is an oxymoron. The rule of law is the basis of our democracy and the foundation of international relations. Facts like operational details may properly be kept confidential, but not the law itself."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/opinion/no-snail-mail-on-saturday.html,"The United States Postal Service is wisely going ahead with a long-debated plan to eliminate Saturday mail delivery, with or without Congress’s blessing. The public, increasingly reliant on Internet communication, has registered 70 percent approval in opinion surveys of the cutback as a no-brainer in modern life that would mean an estimated savings of $2 billion a year.Yet Capitol Hill lawmakers, especially in the House, have been dithering over the politics of ending Saturday delivery and much larger reforms needed to cut postal deficits that are ballooning to more than $15 billion a year.The silver lining is that package deliveries — an increasing moneymaker for the Postal Service — would continue on Saturdays. Letters, catalogs and the rest would wait until Monday. The Saturday move, which would begin in August, should serve as a prod to Congress from the quasi-independent agency, which receives no taxpayer money but is hobbled by lawmakers who micromanage the service for the sake of hometown politics.Current temporary budgetary law permits the change, according to Postmaster General Patrick Donahoe, who stressed that Congress needs to do much more if the service is to live up to its mission as a self-supporting enterprise. The major part of the Postal Service’s deficits come from a 2006 Congressional mandate to make advance payments of $5.5 billion a year for future retirees that no other government agency faces. They have forced the service into defaulting, with a bankruptcy filing looming. Even so, lawmakers have been shamelessly parochial in opposing the service’s plan to close thousands of redundant post offices and sorting centers.The Democratic-led Senate approved a reform plan last year, while the Republican-led House reneged on promises to cut a compromise solution with the Senate. Meanwhile, lawmakers endlessly preach about the need to run government like a private business."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/nyregion/investigators-say-menendez-intervened-on-friends-behalf.html,"WASHINGTON — Senator Robert Menendez of New Jersey intervened with federal health officials on two occasions in the last four years in an effort to help a close friend in a billing dispute with Medicare, federal investigators said Wednesday.The senator’s efforts were unavailing, but he persisted, the investigators said.The senator’s friend, Dr. Salomon E. Melgen, a Florida eye surgeon, is under federal investigation. A team of agents from the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Health and Human Services raided Dr. Melgen’s offices in West Palm Beach and removed 30 boxes of documents and other material last week.The revelation about the senator’s involvement in the Medicare matter was reported by The Washington Post on Wednesday night.Last week, The New York Times published an article detailing the senator’s efforts to help Dr. Melgen, a major benefactor of his, revive a lucrative contract to provide port security in the Dominican Republic.Dr. Melgen has been in a dispute with Medicare officials over billing for a drug used to treat certain types of macular degeneration, which can cause loss of vision and damage to the retina. By getting several doses of the drug from a single vial, investigators said, Dr. Melgen was able to make the drug go further, and as a result, he was able to treat more patients and file more claims with Medicare.Thus, for example, Medicare might allow doctors to bill $2,000 for a vial, but the doctor sometimes filed claims for as much as $8,000, said the investigators, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the inquiry was continuing.While Medicare was trying to recover money from the doctor, the senator contacted federal officials and suggested that the agency was being unfair and needed to clarify its policy, the investigators said.In 2009, they said, Mr. Menendez, a Democrat, called Jonathan D. Blum, a senior official at the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, known as C.M.S. In 2012, they said, the senator expressed his concern in a meeting with Marilyn B. Tavenner, the acting administrator of the agency, which is part of the Department of Health and Human Services.Both officials indicated to Mr. Menendez that they had no plans to change the payment policy for the drug.The government eventually recovered some of the money from Dr. Melgen, but he is exercising his right to pursue an administrative appeal, challenging Medicare’s determination that he had overbilled the program, the investigators said.An aide to Mr. Menendez issued a statement on Wednesday night, saying that the senator had no knowledge of any Medicare fraud investigation involving Dr. Melgen’s company. “Senator Menendez was never aware of and has not intervened in any Medicare fraud investigation on behalf of Vitreo Retinal Consultants,” one of Mr. Melgen’s companies, the aide said.The Menendez aide confirmed that the senator has “in the past raised concerns with C.M.S. about conflicting guidelines and ambiguity in C.M.S. rules that are difficult for providers to understand.” Mr. Menendez wanted to make sure that “providers were not penalized if C.M.S. clarified or changed the rules of the game retroactively,” the aide added.Alan Reider, a lawyer representing Dr. Melgen, issued a statement Wednesday night saying that his client was cooperating fully with the government and had not been told the focus of the investigation. Because Dr. Melgen is a Medicare provider, Mr. Reider said, his claims had been subject to audits by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, and he called the audits routine. “Those audits have been resolved administratively, consistent with Medicare requirements,” Mr. Reider said.The relationship between Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen has been drawing scrutiny since reports recently surfaced that Mr. Menendez had accepted two round-trip flights aboard Dr. Melgen’s jet for personal vacations in the Dominican Republic in 2010. He failed to report them as gifts or reimburse Dr. Melgen at the time, as required. Then in January, he sent the doctor a check to cover the cost of the flights, with his aides saying that he failed to reimburse the doctor earlier because of sloppy paperwork.Mr. Menendez has been helpful to Dr. Melgen. Two years ago, Dr. Melgen bought an ownership interest in a company that had a long-dormant contract with the Dominican Republic to provide port security. Mr. Menendez, who is chairman of the Senate subcommittee that holds sway over the Dominican Republic, subsequently urged officials in the State and Commerce Departments to intervene so the contract would be enforced, at an estimated value of $500 million.While the focus of the investigation involving the raid late last month is not clear, Mr. Menendez finds himself defending his relationship with a major benefactor as he ascends to the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/us/politics/obama-chooses-rei-executive-to-lead-interior-dept.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama on Wednesday nominated Sally Jewell, the chief executive of Recreational Equipment Inc., to lead the Interior Department, with a vow that she will balance the agency’s sometimes conflicting mandates to promote resource development and preserve the nation’s natural heritage.If confirmed, Ms. Jewell, a former oil company engineer and longtime advocate for conservation and outdoor recreation, will take over a department that has been embroiled in controversy over the regulation of oil and gas on public lands and in the Gulf of Mexico and Arctic Ocean. She also will be the steward of hundreds of millions of acres of public lands, from the Everglades of Florida to the Cascades of Washington State.Ms. Jewell, 56, who also had a 19-year career as a commercial banker, took over as chief executive of REI in 2005. The company, which is based in Kent, Wash., just south of Seattle, has since grown to nearly $2 billion a year in sales.She is in line to replace Ken Salazar, who has led the department since the beginning of the Obama administration.The president must also fill vacancies at other major agencies that deal with energy and environmental issues — at the Energy and Transportation Departments and the Environmental Protection Agency. The White House gave no indication on Wednesday that any of those appointments are imminent.While introducing Ms. Jewell at the White House, Mr. Obama alluded to the tensions that have divided the Interior Department’s mission for decades. He said that she is an expert on energy and climate change issues as well as an avid outdoorswoman and a former oil company worker in Oklahoma and Colorado.“She knows the link between conservation and good jobs,” the president said. “She knows that there’s no contradiction between being good stewards of the land and our economic progress, that, in fact, those two things need to go hand in hand.”Ms. Jewell spoke briefly, saying she was humbled and energized by the appointment and looked forward to meeting the senators who will vote on her confirmation.She can expect sharp questioning during those hearings about her approach to resource development — oil, gas and minerals, but also solar and wind power — on public lands. Republicans in Congress have criticized the Obama administration for holding back public lands from oil and gas leasing and for imposing overly restrictive regulations on hydraulic fracturing and other extraction methods.Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, the senior Republican on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, said she was not yet ready to judge Ms. Jewell’s credentials. “I look forward to hearing about the qualifications Ms. Jewell has that make her a suitable candidate to run such an important agency, and how she plans to restore balance to the Interior Department,” Ms. Murkowski said in a statement.Ms. Jewell will also face scrutiny from environmental and conservation advocates who will want to know about her approach to the preservation of public lands.Ms. Jewell, a native of the Seattle area and a graduate of the University of Washington with a degree in mechanical engineering, has been a lifelong outdoors enthusiast. As a child she sailed in the Puget Sound and camped throughout the Pacific Northwest, according to a 2005 profile in The Seattle Times.In 2011, she introduced President Obama at the White House conference on “America’s Great Outdoor Initiative,” noting that the $289 billion outdoor-recreation industry is the source of 6.5 million jobs.Ms. Jewell and her husband, Warren, have made political contributions of nearly $100,000 since the mid-1990s, almost exclusively to Democratic candidates and causes. She contributed to two groups that supported the successful 2012 effort to legalize same-sex marriage in Washington State.The Interior Department post has traditionally gone to a politician from the Western United States, like Mr. Salazar, a former senator from Colorado. Under President George W. Bush, Gale A. Norton, a former attorney general of Colorado, and Dirk Kempthorne, a former governor and senator from Idaho, served in the position.Ms. Jewell, if confirmed, would represent a different model, a corporate executive with experience in both resource exploitation and conservation.Douglas W. Walker, a former chairman of the board at REI and a climbing partner of Ms. Jewell’s, said she is an avid climber, kayaker and sailor who has climbed Mount Rainier in Washington State and Mount Vinson in Antarctica.Mr. Obama referred to her South Pole adventures.“And when Sally is confirmed, I’m willing to bet that she will be the first secretary of the interior who frequently hikes Mailbox Peak in her native Washington State and who once spent a month climbing mountains in Antarctica,” he said, “which is just not something I’d think of doing, because it seems like it’d be cold, and I was born in Hawaii.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/us/politics/new-rove-effort-has-gop-aflame.html,"WASHINGTON — Their battle with Democrats will have to wait. For now, Republicans have their hands full fighting one another.The strategist Karl Rove and his allies are under withering criticism for creating the Conservative Victory Project, their effort to help rebuild the Republican Party and win control of the Senate. Their pledge to take sides in primary races in an effort to pick candidates they see as more electable has set off a fierce backlash from conservative activists.“This is not Tea Party versus establishment,” Mr. Rove said, defending his new project on Fox News. “I don’t want a fight.”Yet a fight has broken out this week across the conservative media spectrum, with Mr. Rove drawing the ire of Tea Party leaders and commentators who suggest that he and other party strategists are the problem, rather than the solution, to the challenges facing Republicans.The Congressional elections may be 21 months away, but the dispute has taken on sudden urgency as primary contests are already taking shape, particularly in open Senate races. Republicans must pick up six seats to win a majority.In Georgia, the contest to fill the seat of Senator Saxby Chambliss, a Republican who is retiring, drew its first contender on Wednesday as Representative Paul Broun announced his intention to run. His candidacy was welcomed more by Democrats than Republicans in Washington, largely because of a string of comments Mr. Broun has made that worry his party’s leaders about whether he has the discipline and broad appeal to win a general election.Mr. Broun, a physician on the House Science, Space and Technology Committee, attracted attention last fall for saying that “evolution, embryology and the Big Bang theory — all of that is lies straight from the pit of hell.”A former member of that committee is Todd Akin of Missouri, a Republican whose bid to move up to the Senate failed last year after he contended that “legitimate rape” rarely causes pregnancy. His defeat was one of many by Republicans that led American Crossroads, the “super PAC,” to create the Conservative Victory Project.The project is intended to counter the work of other organizations that have helped defeat establishment Republican candidates over the last two election cycles. It is the most vigorous effort yet by Republicans to try to impose discipline on the party, particularly in House and Senate primary races.Several other Republicans in Georgia are considering running for the Senate. But the search for what kind of candidates the party should put forward — as well as whether leaders in Washington and the party’s top donors should even be involved in primary races — has focused new attention on the Republican infighting.Chris Chocola, the president of Club for Growth, the conservative group that has taken an active role in Republican primaries, criticized the new effort by Mr. Rove. Mr. Chocola said it was incorrect to suggest that candidates backed by Tea Party groups were the only ones to lose last year, pointing to establishment Republicans defeated in Montana, New Mexico, North Dakota and Wisconsin.He said the “electability argument” Republican leaders make in Washington had produced candidates who have not been able to inspire conservative activists.“It’s those pesky voters,” Mr. Chocola said in an interview. “They get to decide who the nominee is.”The Conservative Victory Project, which will be run by Steven J. Law, Mr. Rove and the donors who built American Crossroads into the largest Republican super PAC of the 2012 election cycle, will start by intensely vetting prospective contenders for Congressional races. They said that they would raise tens of millions of dollars and run television advertising against any candidate who is seen as too flawed to win a general election.“A disastrous candidate can lose anywhere,” said Mr. Law, the president of American Crossroads. “We have to be very careful about candidate selection even in deep red states.”As the Republican feuding intensified, the party’s national chairman, Reince Priebus, indicated that he had no plans to step in as a referee. He sought to straddle both sides of the argument, saying that it was nothing new for Republican groups to get involved in primary races.“Primaries can be a healthy process,” Mr. Priebus said in a statement on Wednesday, “and it’s positive to see any efforts to help support and elect conservative candidates.”But the Republican acrimony has consumed conservative talk radio, cable television and blogs for much of the week. Mr. Rove has taken a thrashing, particularly from the radio host Mark Levin, who suggested that Mr. Rove and his allies needed “a hard, swift kick” off the public stage.David N. Bossie, president of the conservative group Citizens United, wrote a piece on the Big Government Web site that declared, “The Civil War Has Begun.”“This battle will be a long, hard slog against the establishment,” Mr. Bossie wrote, comparing the party’s conflict to the Battles of Lexington and Concord.The testiness became personal on Wednesday when Mr. Bossie and the leaders of two dozen conservative groups released a letter to American Crossroads calling for the dismissal of its spokesman, Jonathan Collegio, because he called the veteran conservative activist Brent Bozell “a hater” in a radio interview.“You obviously mean to have a war with conservatives and the Tea Party,” the letter said. “Let it start here.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/us/politics/house-ethics-committee-investigates-2-lawmakers.html,"WASHINGTON — Representative Aaron Schock, Republican of Illinois, may have improperly solicited a $25,000 donation last year from the House majority leader for a political group seeking to oust incumbent Republicans, an ethics report released Wednesday says.The House ethics committee disclosed on Wednesday that it was continuing to investigate Mr. Schock’s March 2012 appeal for money to Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the Republican leader.At the same time, the ethics committee disclosed a second investigation, into whether Representative Bill Owens, Democrat of New York, improperly accepted a trip to Taiwan that may indirectly have been paid for by the government of Taiwan, in violation of a House rule that prohibits lawmakers from, in most cases, from taking gifts from foreign governments.The ethics committee has not reached a conclusion on either of the allegations. But it released lengthy investigative reports into both cases that had been prepared by the quasi-independent Office of Congressional Ethics, which serves as sort of a grand jury of sorts for ethics matters in the House.The inquiry into Mr. Schock relates to a request he made to Mr. Cantor to consider donating $25,000 to a “super PAC” known as Campaign for Primary Accountability, which was then working to help defeat certain incumbent House members, including Representative Donald Manzullo, a 10-term Illinois Republican.Mr. Cantor ultimately did make the contribution, using his own political action committee, and the donation elicited controversy because the majority leader was supporting a conservative group that sought to oust incumbent Republicans.Mr. Cantor’s aides explained at the time that the majority leader made the contribution because redistricting in Illinois had forced a primary between Mr. Manzullo and a second Illinois Republican, Representative Adam Kinzinger, a favorite of Mr. Cantor and Mr. Schock.The ethics violation may have occurred because the Federal Election Commission only allows lawmakers to solicit contributions for up to $5,000 by independent expenditure groups. It is an odd rule because the provision does not explicitly prohibit donations that exceed this amount.Lawyers for Mr. Schock acknowledged that the Illinois lawmaker had appealed to Mr. Cantor for help in defeating Mr. Manzullo. But his lawyers argued that he had no way of knowing how Mr. Cantor might come up with the requested $25,000 — including possibly collecting the money from several different campaign accounts, meaning he had solicited individual donations that would have been under the $5,000 limit.Mr. Schock’s lawyers disclosed that the matter is also being investigated separately by the Federal Election Commission, and urged the ethics committee to drop the matter, as this was a campaign finance question, not an ethics question. The ethics committee has not indicated if it will formally issue a ruling on this case, only that it is still reviewing the matter.The investigation into Mr. Owens involved a trip the lawmaker and his wife took to Taiwan in December 2011 that was supposedly paid for by Chinese Culture University, based in Taipei. The trip was already the focus on scrutiny because lobbyists hired by the government of Taiwan — a firm led by former Senator Alfonse M. D’Amato of New York — had helped coordinate arrangements for the trip, perhaps a violation of rules that limit lawmakers from accepting privately sponsored travel that is arranged by a lobbyist.The Office of Congressional Ethics report says that it appears — but it could not determine for sure — that the government of Taiwan reimbursed the Chinese Culture University for the $22,000 cost of the trip, luxury hotels, first-class airfare and expensive meals. There is also evidence, in the form of e-mails, that Park Strategies, the lobbying firm run by Mr. D’Amato, helped arrange the trip by Mr. Owens, apparently a rules violation. Details of the trip were first reported by ProPublica in May 2012.Lawyers for Mr. Owens said that the evidence suggesting the government of Taiwan actually paid for the trip was inconclusive and that Mr. Owens, after questions were first raised about the involvement of Park Strategies in arranging the trip, repaid Chinese Culture University for the full cost of the travel. Mr. Owens’s lawyers also argued that the trip was approved by the ethics committee before it took place, as is standard practice for privately sponsored travel."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/nyregion/odds-grow-for-new-ny-wage-and-illegal-immigrant-college-fund.html,"The Republican leader of the New York Senate said Wednesday that his caucus was open to raising the state’s minimum wage and creating a private fund to help the children of illegal immigrants pay for college.Assembly Democrats unsuccessfully pushed for both measures in the legislative session last year, when Republicans controlled the Senate. This year, after losing seats in the fall election, Republican senators formed a power-sharing coalition with an independent faction of Democrats to control the chamber.The comments by the Republican leader, Senator Dean G. Skelosof Long Island, suggested his caucus was now willing to compromise on two important measures for their coalition partners.Mr. Skelos made his comments at a breakfast forum in Manhattan, where he took questions with Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx, who leads the independent Democrats. Both men described the coalition as off to a strong start and predicted it would let the Senate produce legislation that would be impossible with just one party in control.“We’re still Democrats, but we think the best way to move a Democratic agenda is in a bipartisan fashion,” Mr. Klein said of his caucus, adding, “I think what we have to prove, time and time again, is that negotiation is not a dirty word — it’s an effective means of governing.”For “validation that we did the right thing,” Mr. Skelos said, “I think all of us just have to look to Washington, D.C., a town where Democrats and Republicans refuse to talk to one another and nothing ever gets done.”The discussion with the Senate leaders, hosted by Crain’s New York Business, offered a preview of some of the areas of agreement, and disagreement, that lie ahead in the legislative session.A top priority for Democrats, including those who have joined Mr. Klein’s breakaway caucus, is to create a private fund to provide scholarships to children of illegal immigrants to help them pay for college.Mr. Skelos, whose caucus did not embrace similar proposals last year, said Wednesday that legislation setting up a so-called Dream Fund “has a possibility to pass” this year. “I think there is support from people that tend to be a little bit more conservative,” he said, “as long as it’s private money put into the fund.”On the wage issue, he suggested he was more willing to consider an increase this year than he was last year. Gov.Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, has proposed raising the state’s hourly base wage to $8.75, from $7.25.“Last year, the economy was in such a fragile state that it was the wrong time to do it,” Mr. Skelos said, adding, “What I think can be done this year — the economy is improving — is we can have a serious discussion if there’s a way to implement it.”The senators disagreed with Mr. Cuomo in some other areas. Mr. Skelos and Mr. Klein both said the Legislature should have a say over the locations of new casinos if the state’s voters decide to legalize expanded casino gambling; the governor wants to give the casino siting authority to a new gambling commission.Mr. Skelos said he believed that New York City should be considered a possible location for the first round of new casinos, if they are approved. Mr. Cuomo is pushing for the first three casinos to be built upstate in an effort to encourage tourism there. (Last month, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat, said for the first time that he would consider a Las Vegas-style casino in the city.)In a discussion of campaign finance reform, Mr. Skelos cast doubt on the governor’s idea to create a system of public financing for state elections. He said that it would be too expensive and that the money would be better used on things like school aid.Mr. Skelos also made light of Mr. Cuomo’s enviable fund-raising under the existing campaign finance laws. The governor, who is up for re-election next year, reported in January that he had nearly $22.5 million on hand. Exaggerating the size of Mr. Cuomo’s coffers, Mr. Skelos said, “If I had $27 million in my campaign fund, I would probably be for public financing.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/opinion/reading-chuck-hagel-in-tehran.html,"WE’VE heard a great deal about how Washington is reacting to President Obama’s nomination of Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense, so perhaps it’s worth paying some attention to how Hagel is playing in Tehran.Some U.S. pundits have warned that Hagel’s nomination sends a bad signal to the Iranian regime. After all, Hagel has opposed U.S. sanctions against Iran and called a war against Iran unfeasible. Hagel’s critics argue that the simple fact of his nomination telegraphs that the Obama administration isn’t serious about using force to stop Iran’s nuclear ambitions, undermining U.S. diplomacy and making a military conflict more likely rather than less.The U.S. Senate will decide Hagel’s fate, of course. But it’s worth understanding how the Hagel nomination looks to the Iranian leadership.The Iranian regime is hardly cheering Hagel on, despite what some of his critics say. Yes, Hagel sounds cautious about a U.S. bombing campaign against Iran’s nuclear facilities, but such a campaign isn’t what keeps the Iranian supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, up at night. An American strike would spur the Iranian public to rally around the flag and buck up a wobbling, wheezing theocracy — and an Israeli strike would do so in spades.The Iranian leadership’s real worry is not American planes but Iranian protesters. Their deepest anxieties revolve around a Persian version of Tahrir Square, a replay of the 2009 Green uprising that wasn’t ended by the regime’s violent repression. Strange as it may sound, the Islamic Republic is a lot more frightened of the imprisoned Iranian human rights activist Nasrin Sotoudeh than it is of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.As such, Hagel’s nomination was greeted in Tehran with a shrug, not a sigh of relief. The Islamic Republic hardly thinks that with Hagel nominated, it’s off the nuclear hook. Iran’s leaders see U.S. “hostility” as institutionalized and systematized, not produced by partisan politics or individual appointments. As Hossein Salami, a top-ranking Revolutionary Guards officer, said of Hagel, “We view the United States as a political and ideological system driven by its strategic interests rather than by individual politicians.”That was true even in the transition from George W. Bush to Barack Obama. The Islamic Republic greeted Obama’s election in 2008 with mixed emotions. On the one hand, the Iranian regime worried that Obama’s barrier-breaking achievement and inspiring life story might appeal to the average Iranian in a way unmatched by any previous U.S. president.On the other, the Iranian regime continued to believe that its lifelong rivalry with the United States is the result of flatly irreconcilable differences: what it sees as Washington’s unshakable opposition to the Iranian revolution, unqualified and limitless support for Israel, and insistence on competing with Iran for influence over the Middle East.If Obama’s election didn’t change Tehran’s view of U.S. policy, it’s hard to see how Hagel’s nomination could. After all, America’s war-weariness is no secret, and it’s hardly limited to Vietnam veterans such as Hagel. Iranian decision-makers can read The New York Times and watch CNN like anyone else, and they understand the reluctance, both among America’s people and elites, to go to war against Iran over its nuclear program.Of course, Iranian leaders won’t write off the possibility of military conflict with the world’s greatest power, no matter who’s running the Pentagon. An Israeli strike on Iran’s nuclear facilities, a U.S.-Iranian clash in the Gulf, or sudden Iranian moves toward nuclear weaponization could spark a much larger conflict between the United States and Iran. Tehran has prepared for this contingency the best way it can: by burying and hardening its nuclear facilities, expanding its naval capabilities, and building hundreds of missiles that can hit U.S. military assets in the Middle East.But the Iranian regime believes that the true threat to its grip on power is not a military conflict but the mounting effect of sanctions and the specter of internal turmoil. Iran’s oil minister recently admitted that his country’s oil revenues plummeted by 45 percent over the past year. Ordinary Iranians have seen their life savings decimated by the devaluation of the national currency. And Iran’s June 2013 presidential election could trigger renewed political infighting and popular unrest.That’s the view from Tehran, and seen through this prism, Hagel’s nomination hardly signals weakness to Iran. If anything, careful U.S. consideration of its military options could strengthen the international coalition against Iran, deepen Iran’s isolation, and intensify the internal strains that could ultimately doom the regime.What the Islamic Republic fears most isn’t that American officials will be blustery and belligerent. It’s that they will be patient and pragmatic. Alireza Nader is a senior policy analyst at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/nyregion/de-blasio-donors-hit-maximum-but-keep-giving.html,"In an aggressive bid to increase contributions from major supporters, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, has been taking donations to defray old campaign debts from people who have already given the maximum permissible amount to his current campaign for mayor.About two dozen individuals and unions that have given Mr. de Blasio’s 2013 campaign $4,950, the most allowed under New York City’s voluntary public financing system, have then turned around and given him more for his 2009 race, which has been in debt. In some instances, state records show, the donors, as well as their spouses, have given to the 2013 and 2009 campaigns on the same day.The tactic is legal, and many candidates ask donors to defray debts shortly after an election. But it not typical to see debt-defraying donations so closely coinciding with the moment when donors max out to a current campaign, according to city campaign finance officials and watchdog groups.“It stinks to high heaven,” said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization in Washington, which analyzes campaign finance and ethics issues. “Clearly people are being solicited and are giving to these politicians in the hope that it will be noticed and they will get something — access and influence — in exchange for that donation.”The practice, which Ms. McGehee described as “double dipping” or a “double bonus,” is common in statewide and federal campaigns. But in New York City, which has one of the strictest campaign finance systems in the country, Mr. de Blasio’s fund-raising stands out because he has been such a vocal advocate of campaign finance reform, and because none of his three main rivals have done anything similar in scale.Aides to Mr. de Blasio vigorously defended the campaign’s practice as routine and noted that any money raised to settle the 2009 account cannot be used in for the current race. They also noted that his 2009 campaign must pay the city more than $300,000 after being fined by the city’s Environmental Control Board for illegally affixing posters. He has paid more than $100,000 to date.“Like many campaigns, we are forced to raise and spend money to deal with obligations arising out of our 2009 campaign, while also raising money for the current campaign,” said Dan Levitan, a campaign spokesman. “This is standard practice and adheres to New York City’s strict campaign finance laws.”Many of those now giving to Mr. de Blasio’s 2009 campaign for public advocate had not given at the time, but instead began giving to the 2009 campaign only after it became clear that Mr. de Blasio would run for mayor in 2013.For example, Alan Lapes, an operator of private homeless shelters, donated $4,950 on July 8, 2011, to Mr. de Blasio’s mayoral campaign. Mr. Lapes and his wife, Cindy, then donated $4,950 each on April 20, 2012, to Mr. de Blasio’s 2009 campaign, according to records from the State Board of Elections and the city’s Campaign Finance Board.Another first-time donor was Guy Roberts, who manages a taxi fleet in Chelsea. Mr. Roberts contributed $4,500 to the 2013 campaign on Jan. 9, 2012, then $5,000 to the 2009 campaign on Aug. 1, 2012.Over all, Mr. de Blasio has raised $369,000 to repay his 2009 debts, which includes the fine owed to the city among other expenses. The biggest chunk — $139,000 — was raised over the last six months. A few donors have given more than the maximum limit for the 2009 election cycle, the records show, but Mr. Levitan said the campaign “was in the process of issuing refunds.”John C. Liu, the comptroller, whose campaign fund-raising operation is under federal investigation, has raised $344,000 for his 2009 account since winning the 2009 election. But most of that money was raised in 2010. Only in a handful of instances did Mr. Liu’s 2013 contributors — none gave the maximum — later give to his 2009 account.Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, reported five contributors who gave the maximum to her 2013 campaigns, before giving smaller amounts to her 2009 account. William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller, reported one such contributor."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/us/texas-lawmakers-blur-the-advocacy-line-as-lobbyists.html,"Ten years ago, the Texas Legislature passed laws to restrict the lobbying of state agencies by lawmakers on behalf of private clients. Despite the reforms, some elected officials continue to lobby.In some cases, legislators have worked to help clients gain favorable outcomes from elected bodies in their legislative districts. In others, an elected official’s work as a lawyer has blurred the line between lobbying and legal advocacy.Critics see those cases as symptomatic of bigger problems in Texas, where the part-time citizen Legislature faces criticism over weak disclosure rules, conflicts of interest and special-interest donations.“When you’re a member of the Legislature that holds policy decisions, budgeting decisions or other decisions over local governments, you should not be able to represent parties before those governments,” said Craig McDonald, director of the liberal watchdog group Texans for Public Justice.For companies or private citizens hoping to influence decision-makers at state agencies, hiring a well-connected elected official was a common practice until the efforts of two Republican lawmakers on behalf of an herbal supplement firm came to light in 2002.The lawmakers, Senator Jeff Wentworth of San Antonio and Representative Rick Green of Dripping Springs, worked to persuade the state health department not to require prescriptions for Texans taking Metabolife International’s weight loss products that included ephedrine, a stimulant linked to various adverse reactions. Mr. Wentworth also visited state staff and board members involved in the decision.Amid the ensuing scandal, Gov. Rick Perry signed an ethics overhaul package that barred lawmakers from representing private interests before agencies, except for a few situations like submitting paperwork.Former Representative Steve Wolens, Democrat of Dallas, who has helped pass several ethics bills in the Legislature, said the Perry bill did not go far enough. Mr. Wolens said that it failed to prevent lawmakers from being paid to influence the outcomes of measures before city councils, school boards or other local entities.“It’s still problematic, since the state decides the fate of counties and cities for all kinds of things,” he said. “That should equally be prohibited. It’s like, ‘What are we thinking allowing that still?’ ”Representative Senfronia Thompson, Democrat of Houston, recently registered as a lobbyist in her home city on behalf of Linebarger Goggan Blair & Sampson, an Austin law firm. The firm has debt collection contracts with public entities around Texas and has been tied to scandals involving the bribery of public officials.Ms. Thompson, a lawyer who has done work for the firm for years, said a confidentiality agreement barred her from discussing that work. She and the firm did not respond to requests for comment for this article.Representative Garnet F. Coleman, Democrat of Houston, who has held his seat since 1991, registered as a lobbyist in Houston in 2000 for several companies, including Enron and the Greater Houston Transportation Company, a cab provider. Two years earlier, he lobbied the City Council for Sprint PCS regarding regulation of cellular towers.Mr. Coleman said he saw no conflict between his public service and his work as a private citizen. “Clearly, this had nothing to do with state government,” he said.Over the last decade, Mr. Coleman has not registered as a lobbyist, but he has worked as a consultant for companies hoping to gain a favorable vote from the City Council, including Southwest Airlines and Cigna. He said he stopped registering as a lobbyist because he no longer tries to directly influence council members.“I don’t lobby the council,” Mr. Coleman said. “I advise clients.”He said he had turned down clients he suspected wanted him to use his clout for private matters. “It’s not me that’s valuable,” Mr. Coleman said. “It’s my skills.”Even when lawmakers are not lobbying in the traditional sense, their private-sector work can dovetail with their jobs as elected officials in a way that can raise conflict-of-interest questions.Representative Harold Dutton Jr., Democrat of Houston, is a lawyer who has worked on behalf of charter schools that faced being closed by the Texas Education Agency over academic or financial issues. Mr. Dutton has been critical of the agency’s handling of charter schools, including ones he has represented.During a House debate on the budget during the 2011 session, he proposed an amendment to pull the agency’s financing. Mr. Dutton did not respond to requests for comment.Mr. McDonald, of Texans for Public Justice, said state officials might respond to a lawyer’s public remarks differently and even handle a case differently if they know that lawyer will later help shape and vote on the agency’s next budget.“There’s a lot of policy work that can happen behind the scenes or even in public that doesn’t meet the strict definition of lobbying, if you will, but that doesn’t mean it’s not lobbying,” Mr. McDonald said.Some kinds of lobbying remain legal for state lawmakers, but then voters have an opportunity to weigh in.Former Representative Bill Siebert, Republican of San Antonio, had been in office for six years when news reports revealed that he had lobbied the San Antonio City Council for a private firm without having registered as a lobbyist. Mr. Siebert blamed the oversight on a miscommunication between his office and City Hall. But the issue dominated his 2000 re-election bid, which he lost“I felt it was a little bit unjust at the time,” Mr. Siebert said. “The issue of my being a conservative legislator in the district played no role. It was all based on my lobbying of City Hall.”Mr. Siebert, who still works as a lobbyist, maintains that his work on behalf of private clients never conflicted with his work as a legislator.“My job was to educate the couple of City Council people that I talked to,” he said. “These elected officials at the county and the city are very strong people. They represent their constituents, and I don’t think that a state legislator can apply undue pressure on them to do something they don’t want to do.”Voters do not always view experience as a lobbyist as a strike against a candidate. Thomas Ratliff had worked as a lobbyist for more than a decade when he won a spot on the State Board of Education in 2010. Mr. Ratliff, a Republican, said that none of his clients had ever hired him to lobby the board and that he continues to avoid such work.Mr. Ratliff said his openness about his lobbying work has protected him from criticism. On his campaign Web site, he links to the site for his lobbying business, which lists his clients.“The vast majority of people in my district that I hear from think it’s an asset that I’m doing what I’m doing,” Mr. Ratliff said, “because I know how the process works.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/us/politics/cardiss-collins-illinois-congresswoman-dies-at-81.html,"Cardiss Collins, who reluctantly ran for a Chicago Congressional seat left vacant when her husband died in a plane crash and went on to become Illinois’s first black congresswoman, serving for nearly 25 years as a voice for racial and gender equality and expanded health care for the poor, died on Sunday in Arlington, Va. She was 81.Her death was confirmed by Representative Danny K. Davis, who succeeded her in 1997 after she retired from Congress.Mrs. Collins’s husband, George W. Collins, had served two years when he was among 45 people killed in the crash of United Airlines Flight 553 near Midway Airport in Chicago on Dec. 8, 1972. Local Democrats, led by Mayor Richard J. Daley, quickly endorsed Mrs. Collins to succeed him. Mrs. Collins, then 41 and an auditor for the Illinois Revenue Department who was worried about the couple’s 13-year-old son, Kevin, was wary of running but eventually agreed to do so.She campaigned little but easily won the primary in April and cruised through the general election in June with 92 percent of the vote. Six years later, and after some early struggles in office — she had never considered a political career before she was thrust into one — she became chairwoman of the Congressional Black Caucus. For much of the 1980s, she was the only black woman in Congress.“In the last six years, my biggest roadblock has been shyness,” Mrs. Collins told The Washington Post in 1979. “I was basically an introvert, but once people learned I had something to say, I gained confidence.”Mrs. Collins was openly critical of President Jimmy Carter, questioning his commitment to social programs and minorities. She did not invite him to speak at the caucus’s annual fund-raising dinner in 1979, although he had spoken there in previous years, and she expressed support for Senator Edward M. Kennedy when he signaled that he would run against Mr. Carter for the Democratic nomination in 1980.When Ronald Reagan was elected that fall, she was no easier on him when he proposed cutting social programs.“Mr. President, if you promise me you won’t hurt the poor I’ll sit down right now,” she said at a meeting in March 1981 after challenging Mr. Reagan’s description of welfare cheating.Mrs. Collins, who rose to leading roles on a range of Congressional committees, was also a steady supporter of equity in college athletics, pressing the N.C.A.A. to honor the requirements of Title IX and requiring colleges to disclose more details about how they spent federal money.She was particularly assertive on affirmative action and minority employment issues, criticizing various agencies and industries for what she called their poor records of hiring minorities. The Smithsonian Institution and the airline industry were among her targets.She pushed through legislation in 1990 expanding Medicare coverage for mammography screening for older and disabled women and introduced resolutions designating October National Breast Cancer Awareness Month. She wrote laws increasing safety labeling on toys, setting safety standards for bicycle helmets and expanding child care services for federal workers nationwide. She also sponsored several measures to make air travel safer.Cardiss Hortense Robertson was born on Sept. 24, 1931, in St. Louis. Her family moved to Detroit when she was 10, and she graduated from high school there before attending Northwestern University in Chicago. After college, she initially worked as a stenographer at the Illinois Department of Labor. She married Mr. Collins in 1958.Her survivors include her son and a granddaughter."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/nyregion/charles-j-hynes-brooklyn-district-attorney-announces-re-election-bid.html,"Charles J. Hynes, the longtime Brooklyn district attorney, officially announced on Thursday that he would seek a seventh term as the borough’s top law enforcement officer, setting him up for the toughest re-election campaign of his nearly 24-year career.The announcement in front of the steps of Borough Hall was a show of force from an incumbent who has been battered in recent months. He addressed the crowd huddled in the frigid air only after a string of prominent elected officials took the podium first, announcing their endorsements of his campaign and showing that Mr. Hynes was never knocked too far from his power base.After a year in which he has been repeatedly criticized for his political ties and his leadership of the office, Mr. Hynes faces a challenge from Kenneth P. Thompson, a prominent lawyer in private practice, and Abe George, a former prosecutor with the Manhattan district attorney’s office. Both raised more campaign money in the first filing period than Mr. Hynes.Mr. Hynes, 77, who is white, stood before a group of supporters who were mostly minorities, in what some in the crowd interpreted as a demonstration of his support in Brooklyn’s large black and Hispanic communities. Mr. Thompson, 46, is black and Mr. George, 34, is of Indian descent.“We’re not done,” Mr. Hynes said to the crowd of about 100 people during the 20 minute rally. “Not by a long shot.” He ticked off a long list of what he called his accomplishments, including fewer murders than when he took office, and popular initiatives like special courts for drug cases and domestic violence cases.Those who attended the rally included Letitia James, a prominent city councilwoman; Frank R. Seddio, chairman of the Kings County Democratic Committee; Marty Markowitz, the borough president; and more than a dozen other elected officials. Former Mayor David N. Dinkins, who also endorsed Mr. Hynes, did not attend.Mr. Markowitz called the gathering “more than a political rally — it’s a love fest.”Mr. Hynes’s opponent, Mr. George, said the show of support obscured a troubled office. He spoke of a string of wrongful convictions by the office that have been uncovered, and Mr. Hynes’s failure to aggressively prosecute sexual abuse cases in the Orthodox Jewish community.“Despite all these elected officials that are coming out to support, when you take a close look at the record of Joe Hynes, you see that there was some serious problems that Brooklyn has been facing over the last several years,” Mr. George said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/us/politics/house-democrats-have-more-power-in-new-congress.html,"LEESBURG, Va. — After more than two trying years in the political wilderness, House Democrats who gathered here for their annual retreat are starting to appreciate a new political reality that few of them expected: They matter.It is one of the more notable aspects of the current House of Representatives, which is still controlled by Republicans and more deeply partisan than ever. With Democrats now in control of 200 seats, a handful more than they had in the last Congress, and Republicans often sharply split on big issues like spending and taxes, Democratic votes have been decisive in getting major legislation through the House.Other issues that are equally threatening to Republican unity like gun laws and immigration changes will likely be on the agenda early this year, giving Democrats what they hope will be an even bigger opportunity to play a pivotal role both in shaping legislation and in deciding its fate.So far this year, two major bills — the multibillion dollar Hurricane Sandy aid package and the fiscal compromise that let tax rates on high-earners rise — have made it through the House without a majority of Republicans voting yes. That left Democrats as the ones who provided the needed votes.Before that, the last time a bill passed the House with a minority of the majority party behind it was in 2009. And even before then, it was an extremely rare occurrence.“It was somewhat of a pleasant surprise,” said Representative Joseph Crowley, Democrat of New York, “that the minority votes have relevance.”Mr. Crowley, the vice chairman of the Democratic Caucus, said he anticipated that the pattern would repeat itself because Republicans would continue to struggle to find consensus. “Some of these items are going to be difficult for their caucus,” he said. “There’s no doubt about that.”In his remarks to the Democrats who gathered here on Thursday, President Obama recognized the legislative partnership he hopes to have with House Democrats moving forward.“We got a lot of work to do,” the president said, pointing to the lessons from his first term. “What I’ve learned over the last four years is that it won’t be smooth, it won’t be simple; there will be frustrations, there will be times where you guys are mad at me.” But he added that he expected Democrats to “continue the extraordinary progress that we’ve made already.”Representative Steve Israel, the New Yorker who leads the Democrats 2014 House campaign efforts and also held the job in the last election cycle, said party members felt buoyed by their suddenly larger role. “We are, I think, more powerful than we’ve been since 2005,” he said. “We’re more united. We feel empowered.”Their relevance is thanks in large part to an unlikely ally: Speaker John A. Boehner. Mr. Boehner has broken with Republican tradition by dispensing with one of the party’s unwritten tenets. It is known as the “Hastert Rule” for its chief adherent, former Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, who declared: “The job of speaker is not to expedite legislation that runs counter to the wishes of the majority of his majority.”Mr. Boehner did this with the fiscal cliff compromise, which many members of his party opposed in part because it allowed tax rates to rise on people with high incomes and contained little in the way of spending cuts. One hundred fifty one Republicans — some two-thirds of their ranks — voted against the legislation.With the Hurricane Sandy relief legislation, which many conservatives deplored as bloated with giveaways and far too expensive, 179 Republicans voted no.There have also been some close calls. When the House voted last month to raise the nation’s statutory borrowing limit through May 18, 86 Democrats voted yes, providing a cushion so that 33 Republicans could vote no without bringing the bill down and handing Republican leaders a defeat.One of the major choices Mr. Boehner could face this year is whether to allow immigration or gun control legislation to reach the floor even if there is strong dissent within his caucus. He has said that he is open to considering any gun measure the Senate passes. And he has also said that an immigration overhaul is a task this Congress needs to address.Some Democrats said they were heartened by what they saw as the speaker’s pragmatism on these issues.“There are a growing number of Republicans — and this is a very positive development by the way — who want to be seen as here to solve problems rather than force confrontation,” said Representative Peter Welch of Vermont.Mr. Welch said he had seen other Republicans taking their cues from Mr. Boehner’s sudden openness to passing legislation with Democratic support.“He’s made a practical assessment that they can’t hold this confrontational, in-your-face approach that they thought worked in the last Congress,” he said. “That gives license to the individual members to freelance.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/business-and-labor-unite-to-try-to-alter-immigration-laws.html,"After decades of friction over immigration, the nation’s labor unions and the leading business association, the Chamber of Commerce, have formed an unusual alliance that is pushing hard to revamp American immigration laws.These oft-feuding groups agree on the need to enact a way for the 11 million immigrants illegally in the United States to gain citizenship. And they are also nearing common ground on a critical issue — the number of guest workers allowed into the country — that has deeply divided business and labor for years and helped to sink President George W. Bush’s push for an immigration overhaul in 2007.In redefining what constitutes a guest worker and in revamping the method to determine how many should be allowed in, business and labor groups are sketching out new proposals that are distinct departures from earlier legislative approaches.The issue has long been one of contention, with businesses like hotels and farmers saying they need a large supply of seasonal workers while unions complain that these workers are often exploited. To try to resolve their differences, they are discussing what they call a “data-driven system” that would determine how many “provisional workers” would be let in each year to work on farms, summer resorts and elsewhere.One proposal labor is pushing would have Congress establish a panel that would use economic, industry and regional data (like unemployment rates) to determine how many provisional workers should be allowed in annually to work in industries, like farming, that have seasonal surges in their demand for laborers. But business groups say they worry that such a panel would be unwieldy and act too slowly to meet employers’ needs.Under the proposals, the number of provisional workers permitted might increase when America’s unemployment rate was low and then shrink if the rate was high. In addition, many of these provisional visa holders, after working successfully in the United States for several years, might be given permanent residency that could lead to citizenship.In another important step forward, many labor unions have joined with the Chamber of Commerce and other business groups in embracing E-Verify, a federal electronic system that uses Social Security numbers and other data to verify that newly hired workers are in the country legally. Union leaders have frequently denounced E-Verify as error-prone, a continuing concern. They said it often declared that immigrants with valid papers were not authorized to work.When President Bush pushed for an immigration overhaul in 2007, many unions — long detesting the guest-worker program — helped to persuade the Senate to phase out that program within five years. Once that phaseout was approved, many business groups grew far less enthusiastic about the immigration effort. That encouraged many Republicans — already uneasy about what they viewed as “amnesty” — to vote against the plan.Maria Elena Durazo, the chairwoman of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.’s immigration committee, said labor’s opposition to the guest-worker program was longstanding. “Guest workers have no rights and no voice and no possibility of ever becoming legalized,” she said. “If they protest about wages or unsafe conditions, they risk getting deported.”Many businesses have complaints with the current guest-worker program, disliking the frequent requirement to place advertisements to determine whether American workers are available before they can bring in guest workers.“You have to go through four government agencies and often hire a lawyer and an agent,” said Shawn McBurney, senior vice president of governmental affairs at the American Hotel and Lodging Association. “It’s unbelievably complicated, cumbersome and expensive.”Labor unions have urged business to embrace a plan pushed by Ray Marshall, labor secretary under President Jimmy Carter. He suggests creating a commission of experts who would use economic data to determine, for instance, whether 20,000 or 40,000 immigrants should be granted provisional visas to do seasonal work nationwide at shellfish plants, restaurants or apple orchards.“Instead of a system that works at the whim of any employer, it will be a data-driven system,” said Richard Trumka, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Under the current system, he noted, employers have applied repeatedly for new batches of guest workers. A data-driven system would ensure an adequate flow of immigrants to help employers meet seasonal needs, he said.Mr. McBurney of the hotel association disagreed. “It will never work,” he said. “There are no experts who will know exactly what the economy will need — this was proved by command and control economies. The bureaucracy will never be able to respond to the economy. The economy is a very dynamic thing. Bureaucracies aren’t so dynamic.”Randel K. Johnson, senior vice president for labor policy at the United States Chamber of Commerce, agreed. “We oppose the commission because it would never be able to determine shortages in a timely manner that reflect the always-changing realities of the marketplace.”Angelo Amador, vice president for labor policy at the National Restaurant Association, serves on the business-labor group seeking a consensus approach. “I’m optimistic about reaching an agreement,” on guest workers, he said. “The pressure on both sides is great. If we don’t come up with something, someone else is going to be drafted by other people.”Demetrios G. Papademetriou, president of the Migration Policy Institute, a Washington research group, predicted that it would be “extremely difficult” for the two sides to reach agreement on guest workers. He warned that without a deal between business and labor, the whole push for immigration changes could fail.“They could get very close on this issue but might not be able to build a bridge to the other side,” he said. “One side starts from wanting zero guest workers and the other starts from unlimited. The unlimited side might move a lot, but the one that started with zero might not.”He said the stakes were high for the union movement because if it plays a major role in gaining legal status for illegal immigrants, labor’s image will soar among immigrants, and that might help persuade many immigrants to push to join unions.Eliseo Medina, secretary-treasurer of the Service Employees International Union, said labor unions were making a huge push for immigration changes.“If we are going to make conditions better for all workers, we need to make sure that undocumented workers have the same rights as everybody else,” he said. “Otherwise, they’ll be used to lower labor standards.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/us/politics/panetta-speaks-to-senate-panel-on-benghazi-attack.html,"WASHINGTON — In his first term, President Obama presided over an administration known for its lack of open dissension on critical foreign policy issues.But on Thursday, deep divisions over what to do about one of those issues — the rising violence in Syria — spilled into public view for the first time in a blunt exchange between Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, and the leaders of the Pentagon.Testifying before the Senate Armed Services Committee, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta acknowledged that he and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, had supported a plan last year to arm carefully vetted Syrian rebels. But it was ultimately vetoed by the White House, Mr. Panetta said, although it was developed by David H. Petraeus, the C.I.A. director at the time, and backed by Hillary Rodham Clinton, then the secretary of state.“How many more have to die before you recommend military action?” Mr. McCain asked Mr. Panetta on Thursday, noting that an estimated 60,000 Syrians had been killed in the fighting.And did the Pentagon, Mr. McCain continued, support the recommendation by Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Petraeus “that we provide weapons to the resistance in Syria? Did you support that?”“We did,” Mr. Panetta said.“You did support that,” Mr. McCain said.“We did,” General Dempsey added.Neither Mr. Panetta nor General Dempsey explained why President Obama did not heed their recommendation. But senior American officials have said that the White House was worried about the risks of becoming more deeply involved in the Syria crisis, including the possibility that weapons could fall into the wrong hands. And with Mr. Obama in the middle of a re-election campaign, the White House rebuffed the plan, a decision that Mr. Panetta says he now accepts.With the exception of General Dempsey, the officials who favored arming the rebels have either left the administration or, as in Mr. Panetta’s case, are about to depart. Given that turnover, it is perhaps not surprising that the details of the debate — an illustration of the degree that foreign policy decisions have been centralized in the White House — are surfacing only now. A White House spokesman declined to comment on Thursday.The plan that Mr. Petraeus developed, and that Mrs. Clinton supported, called for vetting rebels and training a cadre of fighters who would be supplied with weapons. The plan would have enlisted the help of a neighboring state.The proposal offered the potential reward of creating Syrian allies for the United States during the conflict and if President Bashar al-Assad is removed.Some administration officials expected the issue to be revisited after the election. But when Mr. Petraeus resigned because of an extramarital affair and Mrs. Clinton suffered a concussion, missing weeks of work, the issue was shelved.Syria rebel leaders have long appealed for weapons. Mohammad Hussein al-Haj Ali, a Syrian major general who defected to the opposition, said in a telephone interview last year that he had raised the issue of arming the resistance in a September meeting in Amman, Jordan, with Gen. James N. Mattis, the head of the Central Command, which oversees operations in the Middle East.“He was very sympathetic to it, but his main concern was who would actually get hold of these weapons,” he said, referring to General Mattis.General Haj Ali said he promised that the rebels who were armed would take care not to lose control of the weapons and would return any that they did not use.General Mattis “said he would meet the top administration officials within 48 hours and get back to me,” General Haj Ali said through an interpreter, adding that he still had received no response several weeks later.The debate over arming the rebels is complex and turns on assessments on the military advantages they might gain, the political calculations on who might come to power in Syria, and the dangers that the arms might fall into the wrong hands.Jeffrey White, a former senior analyst with the Defense Intelligence Agency and a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that providing weapons would help the rebels in their fight against a better-equipped government that has warplanes, armor and artillery, and reduce rebel casualties.Equally important, Mr. White said, it would give the United States influence with groups that would control Syria if Mr. Assad is ousted, and would diminish the influence of extremists.“The day after the regime falls, the groups that have the guns will dominate the political and military situation,” Mr. White said. “And if some of those groups owe that capability to us, that would be a good thing. It does not mean that we would control the situation, but it would give us a means of shaping it.”Taking a contrary view, Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former United States ambassador to Israel and Egypt, said the potential risks outweighed the gains. Even with thorough vetting, he said, it would be difficult to ensure that the weapons did not end up with unreliable or hostile groups.“The problem that I think the White House has identified much more clearly than the national security team is, ‘Who are you going to deal with?’ ” Mr. Kurtzer said.Much of the lengthy hearing was devoted to sparring over the Pentagon’s response to the Sept. 11 attack on the United States diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya. The Pentagon chiefs said the military was not able to respond faster because there was no intelligence of an imminent attack. Mr. McCain faulted the Pentagon for not positioning forces in the region before the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks.But the statements by the Pentagon chiefs on Syria were so striking that Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, returned to them after a break in the proceedings.“Both of you agreed with Petraeus and Clinton that we should start looking at military assistance in Syria, is that correct?” Senator Graham asked.“That was our position.” Mr. Panetta said. “I do want to say, Senator, that obviously there were a number of factors that were involved here that ultimately led to the president’s decision to make it nonlethal.“And I supported his decision in the end,” Mr. Panetta continued. “But my answer to your question is yes.”Mr. McCain said he was dismayed that Mr. Obama had “overruled the senior leaders of his own national security team, who were in unanimous agreement that America needs to take greater action to change the military balance of power in Syria.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/penny-pritzker-said-to-be-candidate-for-commerce-dept.html,"WASHINGTON — Penny Pritzker, an heiress to the Hyatt hotel fortune, is a leading candidate to become President Obama’s next commerce secretary as the president slowly moves to complete his second-term economic team.Ms. Pritzker, who led the groundbreaking fund-raising effort for Mr. Obama’s first presidential campaign, withdrew from consideration for the same position in 2008, with some people suggesting that her family’s immense wealth might complicate her nomination at a time of deep financial crisis.Now, however, people familiar with the president’s thinking, who declined to be named because no announcement had been made, said he may yet turn to Ms. Pritzker to lead the Commerce Department and join the administration’s effort to recharge the still sluggish economy. She would succeed Rebecca M. Blank, who has been acting secretary since John Bryson resigned last year, citing health reasons.A formal announcement of who will lead the department is still weeks away, a White House official said, and Mr. Obama could still choose someone else. In the meantime, the president is also searching for replacements in other crucial agencies and departments. The official declined to be named discussing personnel issues.The economic team is to be led by Jack Lew, the former chief of staff whom Mr. Obama nominated to be Treasury secretary. The Senate has not yet considered confirming Mr. Lew’s appointment.Sylvia Mathews Burwell, the president of the Walmart Foundation and a former budget official for President Bill Clinton, is viewed as the leading candidate to become director of the Office of Management and Budget, replacing Jeffrey Zients, who is running the department as its deputy director.Mr. Zients is viewed as a top contender to become the United States trade representative. Ron Kirk, the current trade representative, announced last month that he was leaving the administration.In the coming weeks, the president must also fill the top spots at the Departments of Labor, Transportation and Energy, as well as the Environmental Protection Agency.If Mr. Obama chooses Ms. Pritzker — a close personal friend — to lead the Commerce Department, it could elevate the post after four years in which a series of secretaries and acting replacements largely failed to play a central role in the president’s economic deliberations.By contrast, Ms. Pritzker would enter as a close confidante of Mr. Obama’s. A fellow Chicagoan, Ms. Pritzker’s tireless fund-raising efforts in 2007 made it possible for Mr. Obama to compete against Hillary Rodham Clinton in the long series of Democratic primaries.By connecting Mr. Obama to a vast network of bankers and business executives, Ms. Pritzker helped raise nearly $750 million for Mr. Obama’s 2008 campaign. But her personal fortune and her family’s hotel chain made her a target for criticism, including some from organized labor, which has long accused Hyatt of providing poor working conditions for housekeepers.During the 2012 campaign, Ms. Pritzker played a less prominent role, raising money for the campaign but not leading the effort.At Commerce, Ms. Pritzker could provide the president with a new way to reach out to the business community, which has sometimes been skeptical of his administration’s policies. Ms. Pritzker has degrees in law and business from Stanford.As a woman, she would also help increase the diversity in his second-term cabinet after the departures of several women and minorities. Mr. Obama chose white men to serve at the State Department, the Pentagon, the Central Intelligence Agency and as his chief of staff."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/opinion/americas-genius-glut.html,"WASHINGTONWHILE genuine immigration reform has the potential to fix a seriously broken system, four senators have introduced a bill to solve a problem we don’t have: the supply of high-tech workers.The bill’s authors, led by Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, argue that America would benefit from letting more immigrants trained in science, technology, engineering and math work in the country, with the sponsorship of high-tech companies like Microsoft and I.B.M.But the opposite is the case: the bill would flood the job market with indentured foreign workers, people who could not switch employers to improve their wages or working conditions; damage the employment prospects of hundreds of thousands of skilled Americans; and narrow the educational pipeline that produces these skilled workers domestically.The impetus for the bill, which would give six-year visas to as many as 300,000 foreign high-tech workers a year, is the longstanding lament by business leaders that they cannot find the talent they need in the American labor market. In their version, there is a shortage of scientists and engineers, and the United States is failing to keep substantial numbers of foreign students in the country. As a result, our position as the world’s leading high-tech economy is in danger.Fortunately, they argue, H-1B visas — our guest-worker program for high-tech workers — brings us “the best and the brightest” in the world. We just don’t give out enough of them.But America’s technology leadership is not, in fact, endangered. According to the economist Richard B. Freeman, the United States, with just 5 percent of the world’s population, employs a third of its high-tech researchers, accounts for 40 percent of its research and development, and publishes over a third of its science and engineering articles. And a marked new crop of billion-dollar high-tech companies has sprung up in Silicon Valley recently, without the help of an expanded guest-worker program.Nor are we turning away foreign students, or forcing them to leave once they’ve graduated. According to the Congressional Research Service, the number of full-time foreign graduate students in science, engineering and health fields has grown by more than 50 percent, from 91,150 in 1990 to 148,900 in 2009. And over the 2000s, the United States granted permanent residence to almost 300,000 high-tech workers, in addition to granting temporary work permits (for up to six years) to hundreds of thousands more.The bill’s proponents argue that for the sake of our global competitiveness, we shouldn’t train and then return the tens of thousands of Chinese and Indian students who come here every year. But almost 90 percent of the Chinese students who earn science and technology doctorates in America stay here; the number is only slightly lower for Indians. If they’re talented enough to get a job here, they’re already almost guaranteed a visa.If anything, we have too many high-tech workers: more than nine million people have degrees in a science, technology, engineering or math field, but only about three million have a job in one. That’s largely because pay levels don’t reward their skills. Salaries in computer- and math-related fields for workers with a college degree rose only 4.5 percent between 2000 and 2011. If these skills are so valuable and in such short supply, salaries should at least keep pace with the tech companies’ profits, which have exploded.And while unemployment for high-tech workers may seem low — currently 3.7 percent — that’s more than twice as high as it was before the recession.If there is no shortage of high-tech workers, why would companies be pushing for more? Simple: workers under the H-1B program aren’t like domestic workers — because they have to be sponsored by an employer, they are more or less indentured, tied to their job and whatever wage the employer decides to give them.Moreover, too many are paid at wages below the average for their occupation and location: over half of all H-1B guest workers are certified for wages in the bottom quarter of the wage scale.Bringing over more — there are already 500,000 workers on H-1B visas — would obviously darken job prospects for America’s struggling young scientists and engineers. But it would also hurt our efforts to produce more: if the message to American students is, “Don’t bother working hard for a high-tech degree, because we can import someone to do the job for less,” we could do significant long-term damage to the high-tech educational system we value so dearly.There is no question that the immigration system needs major reform. But let’s not break anything else in the process."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/us/politics/congressman-jim-langevins-personal-quest-on-guns.html,"WARWICK, R.I. — It happened a few minutes before the beginning of Jim Langevin’s junior cadet shift back in 1980.He arrived at the police station here early, as usual. Two officers were standing in the locker room admiring a new .45-caliber semiautomatic pistol. Thinking the chamber was empty, one of them pulled the trigger. A bullet ricocheted off a locker and went right through the boy’s neck, severing his spinal cord.At 16, he would never walk again and never fulfill his dream of becoming a police officer.Now, three decades later and seven terms into his career as one of Rhode Island’s two members of the House of Representatives, Mr. Langevin, 48, is the only quadriplegic ever to serve in Congress. And his story, unknown to many of those who work with him every day in the Capitol, has thrust him into the raging national debate over gun control.For the past month, he has been on a quiet campaign to persuade his colleagues to give up their guest passes to next Tuesday’s State of the Union address by President Obama so that victims of gun violence can attend.That way, he said, when the nation’s highest officeholders look up from the floor of the House to those watching from the gallery, they will not be able to avoid seeing the human toll that guns can exact.“It’s a powerful reminder to every member of Congress how pervasive this issue is,” he said the other day as he pulled his electric wheelchair up to a coffee table in his district office. So far he has nearly 20 takers, and many more who are considering the idea.Mr. Langevin (pronounced LAN-jih-vin), who has boyish looks, a soft voice and an imperturbable demeanor, may not be the highest-profile Democrat pushing for more gun control. And he is not the only House member with a tragic personal history involving a gun.Those stories abound. Carolyn McCarthy, Democrat of New York, lost her husband in the 1993 Long Island Rail Road rampage that also critically wounded her son. The 20-year-old nephew of Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, was shot to death in his apartment in 2011. Bobby L. Rush, Democrat of Illinois, lost his 29-year-old son to a shooting in 1999.But like no one else in Congress, Mr. Langevin serves as what he calls “a visible symbol” of the danger of weapons.“I think when I speak about it,” he said, “at least it gets them to pause and think. It makes it real, the damage that guns can do.”Supporters of stricter gun laws say they see a small window of time in which to act. Mindful of how quickly Washington’s attention can shift, they say they hope Mr. Langevin serves as a conscience check to politicians who are on the fence.“Jim’s wheelchair is a startling reminder of the danger of a bullet,” said Representative Keith Ellison, a Minnesota Democrat who is helping to recruit other members to join the State of the Union effort. Mr. Ellison has given his ticket to Sami Rahamim, the son of a man who was among seven people killed in a workplace shooting in Minneapolis in September.“This effort is a way to resensitize,” Mr. Ellison added. “Some of this conversation has been so callous. ‘Our rights, our rights, our rights.’ Well, what about the suffering of our colleagues?”Ms. McCarthy has invited the chief of police from Malverne, N.Y., whose uncle James Gorycki was killed in the same shooting that claimed her husband.Representative David N. Cicilline, Rhode Island’s other House member and a Democrat, liked the idea so much that he had to tell his original State of the Union guest, the mayor of Central Falls, R.I., that he was sorry but that the invitation was going to someone else. Cleora Francis-O’Connor, whose son was 17 when he was shot and killed in South Providence, will attend instead.Representative Elizabeth Esty, a Democrat whose district includes Newtown, Conn., has invited someone closely linked to the tragedy at Sandy Hook Elementary School, where a gunman took the lives of 26 children and school employees in December.Mr. Langevin’s guest will be Jim Tyrell, whose sister was fatally shot in a robbery at a market in Providence.The special wheelchair Mr. Langevin pilots, which was designed by the same inventor who created the Segway, allows him to raise himself up to about 5 feet tall so he can meet people at closer to eye level, a useful position when your business is politics.When he makes his case to colleagues on gun issues, his appeal is simple and unemotional. “My accident happened in what should have been one of the safest places to be: in a police station, at the hands of trained police officers,” he often says. “So more guns are not the answer.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/us/postal-service-posts-loss-of-1-3-billion-in-first-quarter.html,"WASHINGTON — Holiday shipping and the 2012 election helped the Postal Service stem its losses, but the agency’s financial woes continued in the first quarter, which ended Dec. 31.The Postal Service posted a $1.3 billion loss in the first quarter, compared with a $3.3 billion loss over the same period the previous year. The agency said the first quarter has traditionally been one of its strongest periods.Total mail volume continued to decline, however. It was 43.5 billion pieces for the quarter, down from 43.6 billion for the same period a year earlier, according to agency officials.Revenue from first-class mail, which provides the bulk of the revenue for the Postal Service, declined $237 million, or 3.1 percent, from the same period the previous year, with a decrease in volume of 834 million pieces, or 4.5 percent. Revenue from advertising mail increased $141 million, or 3.1 percent, in the first quarter compared with the same period a year earlier on a volume increase of 783 million pieces, or 3.6 percent. The increase is largely attributable to official election mail and political campaign advertising related to the presidential and Congressional elections mailed during the quarter, which began Oct. 1.The agency’s shipping and packaging business increased by $154 million, or 4.7 percent, over 2012 first-quarter results, fueled by the growth of online shopping and the success of Postal Service marketing campaigns.The agency also said that it cut its operating costs to $18.9 billion from $20.9 billion over the same period last year, a decrease of 9.8 percent. The agency attributed the savings to a number of cost-cutting measures, like staff reductions and the consolidation of some mail processing centers.But postal officials said the agency’s actions alone were not enough. “The encouraging results from our holiday mailing season cannot sustain us as we move deeper into the current fiscal year and face continuing financial challenges,” said Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general. “We urgently need Congress to do its part and pass legislation that allows us to better manage our costs and gives us the commercial flexibility needed to operate more like a business does. This will help ensure the future success of the Postal Service and the mailing industry it supports.”The agency announced this week that it would seek to move to a new delivery schedule beginning the week of Aug. 5. The post office would stop delivering or picking up mail on Saturdays, ending a practice that goes back to the 1890s. Packages would continue to be delivered Monday through Saturday. The Postal Service said the change could result in an annual cost savings of about $2 billion.Members of Congress, postal unions and some businesses strongly oppose the move. But Mr. Donahoe said the Postal Service’s dire financial situation calls for drastic measures.Current projections show the Postal Service will have less than five days of operating cash reserves by the end of the 2013 fiscal year, which the post office said would leave it unable to react to possible economic downturns or other issues.The Postal Service wants Congress to remove a 2006 requirement that it pay nearly $5.5 billion a year for health benefits to future retirees, a mandate imposed on no other agency, which officials have said has crippled the post office. It had an operating income of $100 million this quarter, but the prefunding dragged it into the red. The agency defaulted on two payments last year for the first time and said it would not be able to pay them this year. The agency also wants to be able to enter new businesses, like shipping beer and wine, now prohibited.Last April, the Senate passed a bill that would have allowed the Postal Service to ship beer and wine, reduced its work force, and let the agency recoup more than $11 billion it overpaid into an employee pension fund. The Senate refused to stop Saturday deliveries. The House has taken no action on its postal overhaul.“Our liquidity concerns can only be fully resolved if Congress takes action to address our unsustainable business model, including resolving the overly aggressive payment schedule to prefund retiree health benefits,” said Joseph Corbett, the agency’s chief financial officer. “The Postal Service will continue to prioritize payments to our employees and suppliers ahead of those to the federal government to ensure that we maintain high-quality customer service.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/world/americas/venezuela-devalues-currency-amid-shortages-and-inflation.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuela announced Friday that it was devaluing its currency, a step that had long been deemed necessary but could push the spiking inflation even higher.The devaluation, which lowered the currency’s value against the dollar by nearly a third, was aimed at solidifying government finances and easing a tight market for dollars that has choked back imports and led to shortages of basic goods.The move had been widely anticipated, but it had been unclear whether officials would make what could be a politically risky decision with President Hugo Chávez still out of the country after undergoing cancer surgery in Cuba on Dec. 11.If Mr. Chávez were to die or were too ill to continue as president, a special election would have to be called, and many analysts thought that the government might try to postpone a devaluation until after that occurred.“It is a sign of pragmatism that they carry out a devaluation even though we’re all aware there is some likelihood of a presidential election being held soon,” said Francisco Rodríguez, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. “This shows that they’re willing to correct basic economic distortions.”The currency, the bolívar, will be set at 6.3 to the dollar. It had been set at 4.3.Venezuela’s finance minister, Jorge Giordani, said that Mr. Chávez, who has not been seen or heard in public for more than eight weeks, had approved the measures.“Here is the president’s signature if you want to recognize it or if you still have doubts,” Mr. Giordani said, holding up a document during a televised news conference.The devaluation will help the government balance its books by giving it more bolívars for the dollars it earns selling oil on the world market. Venezuela’s economy is highly dependent on oil, with petroleum sales making up about 95 percent of total exports. The country is the fourth-largest foreign oil supplier to the United States.Government spending soared last year during the campaign to re-elect Mr. Chávez, leading to a large deficit, even though, at more than $100 a barrel, the price of oil is very high.Pressure to devalue had been building for months, as the black market exchange rate rose to more than four times the official rate. The imbalance was evident in the prices of many goods. A Big Mac at McDonald’s costs 70 bolívars, or $16.27, at the official pre-devaluation rate.But the devaluation will also make imported goods more expensive, which will probably make inflation worse. Inflation for the 12 months ended on Jan. 31 was 22.2 percent, one of the highest rates in Latin America.Surging inflation could cause political problems for the government. But the exchange rate had reduced the dollars available to importers, leading to shortages of goods like sugar, chicken and toilet paper. Many analysts believe that voters blame the government more for shortages than for inflation."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/opinion/how-the-post-office-made-america.html,"THE Postal Service’s announcement that it plans to end Saturday mail delivery reminds us of its vulnerability to the technological convulsions of the information age. The agency lost nearly $16 billion last year; stopping Saturday delivery, starting in August, would save about $2 billion a year. To preserve the letter of the law, which requires six-day service, the agency would continue Saturday parcel delivery — a shrewd decision, since, thanks to booming e-commerce, the parcel business is one of the few sectors that is actually growing.Polls suggest that 7 in 10 Americans support the change, but a predictable outcry has emerged from members of Congress, labor unions, periodical publishers and direct-mail marketers. Other critics warn that ceasing Saturday service will be the first step down an irreversible “death spiral.”The controversy gets at a more fundamental question: Do we want the mail to remain a vital American institution in the digital age?When Americans reflect on postal history, they almost always start with Benjamin Franklin. But Franklin had nothing to do with the modern institution that the founders established. It was George Washington and James Madison, not Franklin, who supported the key legislation that got the modern post office up and running in 1792.By then Franklin had been dead for two years; the post office he briefly oversaw in 1775-6 was basically a carbon copy of the British imperial post. The mandate of Franklin’s post office was narrow; its primary rationale was to sustain the fledging revolutionary movement.In contrast, the Post Office Act of 1792, with a broad civic mandate, vastly expanded the postal network while admitting newspapers into the mail at an extremely low rate. No less impressively, it guaranteed the sanctity of personal correspondence by protecting letters from the prying eyes of government. In a stroke, the founders provided the entire population with low-cost access to information on public affairs, while establishing a right to personal privacy.The results were astounding. Alexis de Tocqueville marveled at the skill with which postal administrators circulated hefty bundles of newspapers from New York and Philadelphia to the wilds of Detroit, then a thinly populated outpost on the western frontier. To his eyes, the post office was the only entity with the organizational capability to circulate the information of public significance that was essential to sustain America’s bold experiment with democracy. The German-born philosopher Francis Lieber called it an “element of civilization” — worthy of comparison with the printing press and the mariner’s compass.Saturday delivery started in 1863, after the departure from Congress of anti-urban Southern states in rebellion. Northern legislators instituted free city delivery, thereby creating the modern letter carrier. Before then, Americans almost always picked up their mail at the post office — even on Sundays, if they wished — just as they can today if they rent a post office box.Of course, radio, television and the Internet have irrevocably altered our information-gathering habits, and the post office is no longer the wellspring of democracy it once was. The volume of first-class mail has long been declining as more Americans use e-mail and pay their bills online. Neither junk mail — bizarrely called “standard mail” in postal jargon — nor parcels have been able to pick up the slack.Though it still delivers millions of periodicals — whose low-cost circulation the founders would have heartily endorsed — and countless direct-mail solicitations for businesses, charities and political campaigns, very few Americans get their newspapers in the mail. Even so, by coordinating the circulation of billions of letters, parcels and even so-called junk mail, it helps sustain the social fabric.The millions of parcels that the Postal Service delivers reliably and at low cost provide a salutary check on the pricing policies of FedEx and U.P.S. Wonder why the lines at the post office are so long? It’s because it still provides a service at a cost no rival can match. (Moreover, the agency already works with FedEx and U.P.S. to keep mail delivery affordable. In hundreds of cities and towns, it delivers the “last mile” parcels that FedEx and U.P.S. transport through their hub-and-spoke airborne networks.)Relatively few city dwellers go to the post office to pick up their mail, but in countless hamlets and small towns, the local post office remains a vital community center. For millions of workers, including veterans and African-Americans, a job at the post office has been a ticket to the middle class and has provided a pension and medical care to retirees. The Postal Service is the country’s second largest civilian employer, after Walmart.Postal correspondence is far more secure than e-mail and far less vulnerable to cyberattack. By capitalizing on its expertise in scheduling and high-volume sorting, the Postal Service has the potential to become a big platform for digital commerce. It helped pioneer optical character recognition, now a widely used technology. But Congress and regulations have frustrated the post office from issuing secure e-mail addresses and expanding by providing same-day service for digital retailers, for example, while obliging it to bankroll money-losing operations like six-day delivery.Postmaster General Patrick R. Donahoe announced in 2011 that the Postal Service would substantially reduce overnight delivery for first-class mail, considering closing up to 252 of 487 mail-processing facilities, make bookkeeping changes involving pensions and shrink the work force. Together with ending Saturday delivery, those steps might restore solvency by 2015.In 1899, Postmaster General Charles Emory Smith called the post office the “greatest business concern in the world.” He had it wrong. The post office is a public service with a civic mandate central to American business, society and civic culture — not a business. But if it is to survive, Congress must allow it to start acting like one."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/world/europe/in-georgia-crowd-attacks-mikheil-saakashvilis-allies.html," TBILISI, Georgia — An angry crowd attacked allies of President Mikheil Saakashvili outside the site for an annual address to the nation on Friday, as Georgia’s five-month-old power-sharing experiment deteriorated into open conflict.A mob surged toward Gigi Ugulava, the mayor of Tbilisi, as the police looked on, unable or unwilling to control a crowd that had taken shape hours earlier and vowed to prevent Mr. Saakashvili from entering. At least five lawmakers from the president’s party were reported injured in the brawl.Mr. Saakashvili’s party, which had dominated Georgian politics for nine years, lost a parliamentary election last year to an opposition coalition, Georgian Dream. It was the first constitutional transfer of power in this country with a long history of civil unrest, and Western leaders hailed it as a breakthrough for the post-Soviet region.But that moment quickly soured. Since Mr. Saakashvili’s presidential term does not end until October, he must serve alongside Bidzina Ivanishvili, the prime minister, who loathes and distrusts him. The new government has cut Mr. Saakashvili down to size, stripping him of his private plane and reducing his household budget, but the president retains the right to dissolve the government and call for new parliamentary elections, levers his opponents fear he will use.Friday’s confrontation began when lawmakers from Mr. Ivanishvili’s coalition canceled Mr. Saakashvili’s address to the nation, which is traditionally delivered in the Parliament chamber.Mr. Saakashvili, defiant, said he would deliver the speech at the national library in Tbilisi. By midday Friday, several hundred protesters — many of them prisoners newly freed by an amnesty that the president had opposed — had gathered outside the building, seething with anger.One of them, Giorgi Gorelashvili, 57, said he had served two years after he was convicted of spying for Russia.“He has no right to make speeches, and we will not allow him in,” he said. “Saakashvili is not the president anymore.”When Mr. Saakashvili’s central allies arrived, 10 minutes before the speech was to begin, protesters began pelting them with eggs. The library’s front door had been decorated with brooms, in a grim reference to a prison abuse scandal last fall, which featured video of a man being sodomized with a broom. Two men repeatedly punched Chiora Taktakishvili, who served as a campaign spokeswoman for Mr. Saakashvili’s party, leaving her dazed and with blood running from one nostril.The fracas ended after about 10 minutes when Mr. Saakashvili’s allies left. Each side has blamed the other for provoking violence. David Usupashvili, the speaker of Parliament, described it to reporters outside as “another spectacle and provocation of Saakashvili, which the protesters unfortunately succumbed to,” the Interfax news agency reported.Among those who had already entered the building when the brawl began were diplomats who had come at Mr. Saakashvili’s invitation, like the United States ambassador, Richard Norland.“There are certain basic principles in democracy, and no matter how strongly you feel about an issue or how much you feel you’ve been wronged, there is no excuse for using violence, for punching parliamentarians as they go in to hear a speech by the president,” Mr. Norland told reporters outside. He warned of reports that crowds were moving toward Mr. Saakashvili’s palace.Mr. Saakashvili made no effort to get into the library. Instead, he invited his loyalists and the assembled diplomats to hear his address two hours later in the president’s palace.At a fruit stand near the site of the brawl, people crowded around a small television to watch coverage of the melee and discuss what had happened and who was to blame.“The only thing left for us, ordinary people, is to pray for peace to return,” Aleksandr Makharashvili, 45, said. “I am afraid there is no way they will be able to shake hands of each other after this.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/nyregion/trial-for-liu-supporters-to-start-in-april.html,"The trial of two allies of the New York City comptroller, John C. Liu, will start on April 15, a judge said Friday after ruling that one defendant, now in the hospital, was competent to stand trial.Jury selection had been scheduled to begin this week in Federal District Court in Manhattan in the case against Mr. Liu’s former campaign treasurer, Jia Hou, and a fund-raiser, Xing Wu Pan. They have been charged with conspiring to funnel money to Mr. Liu’s campaign through an illegal campaign-finance arrangement. But it was delayed on Tuesday after the judge, Richard J. Sullivan, announced that Mr. Pan, a New Jersey real estate developer who is also known as Oliver, had been “involuntarily committed in connection with a mental health condition.”On Friday, Judge Sullivan said that he had received a sealed report from Mr. Pan’s doctor, dated Feb. 7. The report said Mr. Pan was competent but would “continue to receive inpatient treatment for the foreseeable future.”As a result, Judge Sullivan set the new start date, and ordered Mr. Pan’s lawyers to inform him when he was released from the hospital.The trial has been widely anticipated because it follows an exhaustive investigation into the campaign finances of Mr. Liu, a Democrat who is likely to run for mayor. Mr. Liu has not been charged with wrongdoing.The case could prove to be even a greater distraction for Mr. Liu in April, when voters will be paying more attention to politics as the mayoral campaign heads toward a September primary."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/nyregion/lhota-draws-wealthy-donors-but-high-hurdles-remain.html,"Kenneth G. Langone, the billionaire co-founder of Home Depot, has pledged his financial backing. Peter S. Kalikow, the real estate investor, has cut a big check. And James S. Tisch, the chief executive of the Loews Corporation, is on board.Titans of New York City business are buzzing about the mayoral candidacy of Joseph J. Lhota, a former investment banker, Giuliani administration official and chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, whose Republican bid is built on his reputation as a skilled manager.Mr. Langone, a prodigious Republican donor, is even entertaining the possibility of an independent political action committee, unbound by spending limits, devoted to electing Mr. Lhota. “All I know is that Joe is not going to want for money,” he said in an interview.But as big-name donations begin to roll in to the campaign, Mr. Lhota is confronting a persistent question, even from his own supporters: Can a latecomer to the race raise enough money to overcome the financial might of a billionaire rival from within his party and the electoral advantages of a well-known Democrat?As soon as Mr. Lhota jumped into the race, jolting a relatively tepid Republican field, the owner of the Gristedes supermarket chain, John A. Catsimatidis, officially declared his candidacy for the party’s nomination, vowing to dip into his own vast fortune, Bloomberg-style, to prevail. Mr. Lhota does not have such resources; aides say he is likely to participate in the city’s campaign finance program, which matches private donations with public funds for candidates who agree to abide by a strict spending cap.“Joe has an uphill battle,” said Mr. Kalikow, a former owner of The New York Post. “I did tell him that.”Mr. Kalikow, who said he admired Mr. Lhota’s decision to run for mayor, is a case in point: He has also donated to the Democratic mayoral campaign of William C. Thompson Jr., a former city comptroller, whom he called a “very good friend.”Mr. Lhota’s résumé and his record in the business-friendly administration of former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani make him a natural candidate of the city’s corporate and real estate crowds, long a reliable source of campaign contributions.But Mr. Lhota’s Democratic rivals have made deep inroads with the city’s business community over the past four years, earning the good will — and campaign dollars — of many real estate and finance moguls.In interviews, a dozen such executives expressed personal affection for Mr. Lhota but skepticism about his ability to win a general election. In the city, registered Democrats outnumber Republicans six to one.The executives contend that Mr. Lhota, who has never sought public office and has relatively low name recognition, will struggle to distinguish himself given the spending limits imposed by the campaign finance program.“Republicans in New York only win under special circumstances,” said a major developer, who has spent time in city government, and insisted on anonymity to protect his relationship with the candidates. “I don’t know anything that helps Lhota. There’s no crisis. The city’s not broke or torn to pieces by rioting.”Mr. Lhota’s biggest hurdle may be the support already claimed by the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, a Democrat who has quietly become a fund-raising powerhouse in the corporate corridors by working closely with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and by taking a moderate approach to legislation affecting businesses.An analysis of campaign contributions from employees of about 100 of the city’s most politically active corporations and organizations shows that Ms. Quinn is by far the biggest recipient, commanding 67 percent of their donations in the current election cycle. (Some of the donations are carried over from 2009, when she considered a mayoral run but opted out.)For instance, employees of the Related Companies, a major developer, have given $40,050 to her, dwarfing the employees’ $3,450 in contributions to the second-biggest recipient, Public Advocate Bill de Blasio, another Democratic candidate.Mr. Lhota recently spoke with top executives from Related, people told of the conversations said. But according to these people, the company’s leaders are loath to do anything that might alienate Ms. Quinn. She has even won the backing of several donors to Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, who would seem to be ideological allies of Mr. Lhota. One of them, Ronald O. Perelman, the financier and chairman of Revlon, said Ms. Quinn and Mr. Bloomberg “made a great team.” He called her “tough, fair-minded and extremely competent.”Another Romney donor, Randy L. Levine, the president of the Yankees, who served alongside Mr. Lhota as a deputy mayor in the Giuliani administration, has given sizable contributions to both Ms. Quinn and Mr. Thompson, citing his longstanding relationship with them.A Lhota spokeswoman said his fund-raising was “on schedule” but declined to discuss it in detail. The extent of his fund-raising will not be known until he files a required report with the city in mid-March.The candidate’s advisers are adamant that he can raise enough money to prevail in a primary and the general election, pointing to his deep network of relationships with business leaders; his ties to Mr. Giuliani, who has pledged to tap into his network of donors; and the track record of his wife, Tamra Lhota, a former Giuliani fund-raiser.During a recent talk to members of a Republican club in Brooklyn, however, Mr. Lhota suggested that his wife would not join the campaign in a formal capacity, playfully bemoaning the occupational hazards of working too closely with a spouse.So far, Mr. Lhota is eschewing big fund-raising events that might count toward his spending limit. Instead, he is favoring a few smaller events at donors’ homes and encouraging supporters to give online. He plans to hire Tamara Hallisey, a fund-raiser for John McCain in the 2008 presidential campaign.Still, Mr. Lhota’s backers are leaving open the possibility that an outside group might form to bolster his candidacy.Mr. Langone, who raised millions of dollars for Mr. Romney, said, “I plan to do everything I can to help Joe Lhota get elected, as long as it’s ethical and as long as it’s legal.” He called Mr. Lhota “a superb manager.”On Feb. 22, Mr. Langone and Mr. Lhota will host a breakfast at the Harvard Club that is expected to draw donors and fund-raisers. Many of those attending say Mr. Lhota is singularly qualified to lead the city in the post-Bloomberg era, when they predict an uneven economy will test the city’s finances and public worker unions will seek to exploit close ties to Democratic candidates.“I worry a lot about the fiscal health of New York City,” said Mr. Tisch, the head of Loews and an invitee to the Lhota breakfast. “As I look around at the group of people running for mayor, the person I think has the best capacity of dealing with these issues is Joe.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/us/politics/panel-chairman-criticizes-gop-request-on-hagel-financial-data.html,"WASHINGTON — Senator Carl Levin, the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, told the committee’s top Republican on Friday that he and other Senate Republicans were out of bounds for demanding additional financial information from Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s choice to be defense secretary.Mr. Levin, Democrat of Michigan, said he would move quickly to hold a committee vote on Mr. Hagel’s nomination, and White House officials said they remained confident that Mr. Hagel would be approved, probably on a party-line vote, with all 14 Democrats in favor and all 12 Republicans opposed. They said Mr. Hagel would have the votes of enough senators to overcome any filibuster attempt when his nomination goes to the full Senate. The votes could be held early next week.In a strongly worded letter to Senator James M. Inhofe of Oklahoma, the committee’s top Republican, Mr. Levin said that he had “read with some concern” a Wednesday letter from Mr. Inhofe and 25 other Republican senators. Mr. Levin said the letter appeared “to insist upon financial disclosure requirements that far exceed the standard practices of the Armed Services Committee and go far beyond the financial disclosure required of previous secretaries of defense.”The letter, which was drafted in the office of Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, asked Mr. Hagel to provide, among other things, the amount of foreign financing over the past decade for seven companies he had worked for. The letter also asked Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, to disclose the amount of foreign financing over the past five years for the Atlantic Council, a centrist foreign policy group, where Mr. Hagel has served without compensation as the chairman of the board of directors.In his letter, Mr. Levin said that Mr. Hagel was no longer associated with four of the companies but continued to receive compensation as an adviser to three: Corsair Capital, McCarthy Capital and M.I.C. Industries.“I am doubtful that, as mere adviser to these companies, Senator Hagel has either access to the corporate financial information that is sought in the February 6 letter or the authority to release such information if he were able to get access to it,” Mr. Levin wrote.Mr. Levin said that the committee had never required or sought such information from nominees in the past, and concluded, “The committee cannot have two different standards for nominees, one for Senator Hagel and one for other nominees.”In reply to Mr. Levin, Mr. Inhofe said in a statement that “there are members of the committee that believe in order to properly consider this nomination that additional information is required.” He added, “I am working to address these members’ concerns.”Forms that Mr. Hagel previously filed indicated that he had assets of $2.865 million to $6.1 million. In the 1980s, Mr. Hagel helped found Vanguard Cellular, a wireless carrier that made him a multimillionaire."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/opinion/the-assassination-of-chokri-belaid-in-tunisia.html,"Tunisia is where the Arab Spring began just over two years ago. Until now it has set an encouraging example of progress toward democracy and pluralism. Free elections brought to power a coalition government pledged to pragmatic cooperation between a moderate-led Islamist party, Ennahda, and smaller, secular coalition partners.Progress has not always been smooth. But just as Tunisians inspired people in neighboring countries like Egypt and Libya to rise up against their corrupt and repressive dictators, they also seemed, for many, to point the way toward a democratic future accommodating both religious beliefs and the rights of the secular under the rule of law.Those hopes have been severely shaken by the murder on Wednesday of Chokri Belaid. Mr. Belaid, a human- rights activist and one of Ennahda’s most outspoken critics, had publicly challenged the party’s failure to investigate or prosecute violent acts of intimidation carried out by shadowy gangs of religious extremists. Mr. Belaid’s killers have not yet been identified. But suspicion now falls on those same extremist groups, which had issued public threats against Mr. Belaid and other prominent secular leaders — without any serious government response.Thousands gathered for Mr. Belaid’s funeral on Friday amid a nationwide general strike called by his trade union supporters. Tensions are high. What is urgently needed is a credible, independent investigation of Mr. Belaid’s murder, followed by prosecution of the killers.Given Ennahda’s record of selectively ignoring Islamist violence, that investigation cannot be left to its appointees alone. A preferable alternative would be to reconstitute the broad-based, multiparty commissions that successfully oversaw Tunisia’s free elections in October 2011 and investigated the crimes of the fallen dictatorship.Ennahda, which captured 41 percent of the vote in the elections, promised to cooperate with secular parties and show respect for pluralism. Instead, it is sending muddled messages. On Wednesday, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali made a conciliatory gesture by proposing a temporary nonpolitical cabinet and new elections. Unfortunately, hard-line party members quickly repudiated him.Tunisia’s revolution, which has overcome past crises, can overcome this one if Ennahda and all other Tunisian parties recommit themselves to nonviolence, mutual tolerance and upholding the rule of law."

Reports of a plea agreement for Mr. Jackson began to surface earlier in the week in The Chicago Sun-Times.Mr. Jackson, 47, a longtime United States representative, took a medical leave from his job last June, and never returned. He was treated for bipolar disorder, his office has said. He acknowledged a continuing criminal investigation into his campaign funds when he resigned from Congress in November after winning re-election.Representatives for Mr. Jackson in Chicago and Washington did not respond to requests for comment on a plea deal, and Mr. Jackson’s father, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, brushed aside reporters’ questions on Friday in Chicago.A number of candidates are competing to succeed Mr. Jackson, who represented the South Side of Chicago and southern suburbs. A primary is set for Feb. 26."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/world/europe/berlusconi-remains-the-wild-card-in-italy-parliament-race.html,"ROME — One candidate promised to drop an unpopular new property tax and refund all prior payments in cash. Another called that proposal a “poisoned meatball,” disconnected from reality. A third suggested that Al Qaeda blow up the Italian Parliament — then backtracked — and the man generally considered the front-runner is campaigning on vague promises of stability, so has often been ignored.With only two weeks to go before national elections, the Italian campaign has become a surreal spectacle in which a candidate many had given up for dead, former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi, has surged. Although he is not expected ever to govern again, with his media savvy and pie-in-the-sky offers of tax refunds, Mr. Berlusconi now trails the front-runner, Pierluigi Bersani, the leader of the Democratic Party, by about five or six points, according to a range of opinion polls published on Friday.The polls found that the former comedian Beppe Grillo, who made the Qaeda quip as part of his antipolitical campaign, is close behind in third place, while the caretaker prime minister, Mario Monti, who made the “poisoned meatball” remark as he stepped up attacks on Mr. Berlusconi in an awkward transition from technocrat to candidate, is taking up the rear with around 10 percent to 15 percent of the vote.Most analysts predict that the center-left will win, but with not enough votes to govern without forming an alliance with Mr. Monti’s centrists. Yet in a complex political landscape — and with significant policy differences between Mr. Monti and Mr. Bersani, who have been criticizing each other in their campaigns — nothing is a given, and the political uncertainty weighs on financial markets.Some compare the election to a power struggle on a corporate board. “Mr. Berlusconi knows he can’t govern, but wants a strong seat at the table,” said Marco Damilano, a political reporter for L’Espresso, a weekly. The Democratic Party will have the majority of seats but will not be able to govern without making accords, he said, adding that “Monti wants the golden share,” in which his few seats count for a lot.Many outsiders marvel at the survival skills of Mr. Berlusconi, who dragged down Italy’s finances and international standing to the point that Mr. Monti was brought on in November 2011 to lead an emergency technocratic government that lasted a year. But at least a good part of Mr. Berlusconi’s success has to do with his competition.Mr. Monti lacks a strong party and has hit Italians with unpopular taxes, and centrists who might lean left are concerned that Mr. Bersani would be weak on the flagging economy. On top of that, Mr. Berlusconi, whose center-right People of Liberty is more a charismatic movement than a party, has true loyalists who do not know where else to turn.“Berlusconi is politically dead, but his electorate is still there and it is looking for a new leader, and there isn’t one,” said Massimo Franco, a political columnist for the daily newspaper Corriere della Sera. “So it’s a sort of a nostalgic operation.”In an auditorium near the Vatican, Mr. Berlusconi was greeted Thursday by rows of adoring fans, most of them retirees. “Ah,” he said. “It reminds me of the good old days.” Joking about his age, the 76-year-old former premier added: “I looked at myself in the mirror and saw someone who didn’t look like me. They don’t make mirrors the way they used to.”In a two-hour off-the-cuff speech, he returned to familiar themes: depicting the left as unreconstructed, cold-war Communists; magistrates as politically motivated; the euro and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany as harming Italy; and Mr. Monti as a leader beholden to foreign interests who did nothing but raise taxes.His supporters were mostly buying it. “Even if he doesn’t refund us the property tax, at least he’ll take it away,” said Francesca Cipriani, 70, a retiree, as she cheered Mr. Berlusconi.“My house is worth 20 percent less,” Nicola Manichelli, 75, a retired taxi driver, chimed in.Marcello Sorgi, a columnist for the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa, said: “Berlusconi voters fear that Monti will raise taxes, and that under Berlusconi that won’t happen. It’s not at all true, but Berlusconi’s propaganda works with his electorate.”“His electorate still has a messianic, religious rapport with him,” Mr. Sorgi added.“Berlusconi is considered a kind of guru.”Not so with Mr. Monti, who is beloved in Brussels, Berlin and Washington, but has been less popular with Italian voters. As he learns to campaign, Mr. Monti, an economist with no previous political experience, has sought the services of the political consulting firm AKPD Message and Media, whose co-founder, David Axelrod, President Obama’s key political strategist, visited Mr. Monti in Rome last month.Mr. Monti, who is trying to capture the civic-minded centrists from both right and left who once voted for the centrist Christian Democrats before the party disbanded in a corruption scandal in the early 1990s, also opened a Facebook page. He uses it to post folksy musings that some critics say are undermining the authority of the slyly ironic but hardly showmanlike candidate instead of humanizing him.Last week, an interviewer presented Mr. Monti with a puppy on live television, days after Mr. Berlusconi had appeared with one. “This is a mean blackmail,” Mr. Monti said with a smile, before stroking the fluffy pet and saying, “Feel how soft it is.”Mr. Bersani, a longtime party veteran and former economic growth minister, speaks more to the old guard of the Italian left. He defeated Matteo Renzi, the charismatic 38-year-old mayor of Florence, in a rare party primary and has been running on the slogan “A Just Italy,” a message aimed at reassuring voters but which may not inspire them.In a half-hour speech on Thursday to party loyalists, including municipal workers and frustrated university adjunct teachers, Mr. Bersani called attention to youth unemployment and the disconnect between the real economy and financial markets, and called for economic stimulation to help more people have steady jobs. “Europe isn’t just the fiscal compact,” he said.Both Mr. Berlusconi and Mr. Bersani appear to speak more to their own constituencies than to the nation as a whole, long a characteristic of Italian politics. Faced with a political class that seems stuck in the past, Mr. Grillo and his antipolitical Five Star Movement have been gaining ground in the polls, campaigning in piazzas across Italy."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/nyregion/a-review-of-ma-maison-brasserie-in-millburn.html,"When I was young, French dining reigned; if you wanted to eat fancy, you ate French. Then the restaurant landscape changed dramatically, and French restaurants, whether classic or more casual, became increasingly rare. That was one reason the opening of Ma Maison Brasserie in downtown Millburn in July generated so much enthusiasm. Another was that its chef and owner, Franco Ammirati, also owns the town’s beloved Café Luna, an intimate Italian-style restaurant with a distinctive European feel.Is Ma Maison as pleasing? Does it serve the same good, reasonably priced food?Depending on when you go and what you order, the answers can be yes and yes. I ate a plate of small, double-cut baby lamb chops grilled with garlic and herbs and was reluctant to share even one. The chops were small but meaty and cooked exactly as ordered, rare inside but with a crust that exuded the crisp, smoky flavor of the grill. Take even a nibble, and the chop oozes juice.Another simple dish, a steak au poivre, crackled with the sharp, pungent flavors of red, black and yellow peppercorns. A pool of Cognac-scented cream beneath the steak balanced the intensity of the peppers on top. At $24.95, the dish is one of many reasonably priced entrees on a menu that also features lighter and less expensive items, including pastas and pizzas in the $12 to $20 range.As for when you dine, Ma Maison, like Café Luna, is a family affair. Mr. Ammirati is the chef and owner, but on weekend nights, when his wife, Sharon, appears, the two brick-walled dining areas that make up the dimly lit restaurant suddenly glow. No hostess ever seemed more attentive, taking charge of new arrivals as if they were family.Mrs. Ammirati is also a vegetarian, which perhaps explains the deep purple radicchio leaves and bright, fresh greens that are in the salads and that accompany select entrees. And in the chèvre salad, even those greens are overshadowed by slices of caramelized pear resting among the walnuts, a sweet counterpoint to the tangy cheese. A Caesar salad also featured a surprise ingredient, bacon, but it, and too much mayonnaise in the dressing, resulted in a kind of gustatory confusion: you saw a Caesar salad, but you tasted a B.L.T.Ma Maison is mainly French, but Mr. Ammirati, born in San Remo, a city in Italy 45 minutes over the French border from Nice, produces dishes that betray his Ligurian roots. Some of these are among the menu’s highlights. The sauce that surrounds the scallops and shrimp in his noix de Saint-Jacques, for example, isn’t heavy and white, as in the classic French version, but pink and delicate, lightened with tomato and just a touch of cream. The dish also includes the velvety halves of a large, fresh artichoke heart, another inspired touch.Ma Maison is not even a year old, which may explain the inexperience of some of the servers as well as inconsistencies in the kitchen. Here are plump mussels and crisp fries but also soggy crepes and ordinary pizzas. Regarding the pizzas, the problem is mostly the dough; in spite of being cooked in a wood-burning oven, it is dull. Among the other dishes, the sea bass topped with crab meat, a special one night, tasted old — I sent it back — and an order of pappardelle, served in a sauce of fresh tomato and basil, arrived as one glutinous mass.From the same kitchen, however, several flawless French dishes emerged. Among these was a duck confit adorned with irresistibly sweet and winy figs — Mr. Ammirati stews them in a reduction of balsamic vinegar that he enriches with cream — and a sole meunière that was properly lemony and brightened with capers.Follow these with Mr. Ammirati’s homemade profiteroles. The cream puffs are doused, rather than delicately drizzled, with a chocolate sauce so dark and rich it almost hurts to swallow. Linger over this dessert and an espresso, and you’ll be glad that instead of another Italian, Mexican or Asian restaurant in suburbia, this recent arrival is French."

Bush in 2000, the former vice president and Tennessee senator Al Gore has been a best-selling author; starred in an Oscar-winning documentary, “An Inconvenient Truth” (2006); won the Nobel Peace Prize, in 2007, for his environmental activism; and made a fortune some have estimated to be bigger than Mitt Romney’s, thanks in part to the recent sale of his stake in the Current TV network to Al Jazeera. In “The Future: Six Drivers of Global Change,” Gore takes on a subject whose scale matches that of his achievements and ambition.Gore’s “six drivers of global change” are divided among corresponding chapters primarily related to technology and the material world — “Outgrowth,”  “The Reinvention of Life and Death” and “The Edge” — and those involving the transformation of politics and society by technology — “Earth Inc.,”  “The Global Mind” and “Power in the Balance.” In the discussion of his first three topics, Gore presents a mostly grim picture of environmental degradation as a result of human population growth and rising consumption. So he tells us not only about global warming caused by fossil fuels, but also about topsoil depletion, fishery depletion and the depletion of critical minerals. Gore’s warnings about global warming have made him controversial in some circles, but he pre-empts accusations of overstatement by writing: “In the parable of the boy who cried wolf, warnings of danger that turned out to be false bred complacency to the point where a subsequent warning of a danger that was all too real was ignored.”Still, the faults of “The Future” have less to do with Gore’s particular approach to his material than with the shortcomings of the genre itself; futurist polemics tend to alternate between exposition and exhortation. When the alternation is too rapid, we get passages like the following. “There are already several reckless practices that should be immediately stopped: the sale of deadly weapons to groups throughout the world; the use of antibiotics as a livestock growth stimulant; drilling for oil in the vulnerable Arctic Ocean; the dominance of stock market trading by supercomputers with algorithms optimized for high-speed, high-frequency trades that create volatility and risk of market disruptions; and utterly insane proposals for blocking sunlight from reaching the Earth as a strategy to offset the trappings of heat by ever-mounting levels of global warming pollution.”At his best, Gore is an articulate, engaging and imaginative polymath, capable of discussing both contemporary globalization and flows of trade a millennium ago or pointing to the use of invisible ink in the Middle Ages as a precursor to modern cryptography. He shows a willingness to rethink positions and admit errors that is as rare among prophets and pundits as among politicians. In speaking, for example, about the possibility of adapting to global warming even while trying to minimize it, he writes: “For my own part, I used to argue many years ago that resources and effort put into adaptation would divert attention from the all-out push that is necessary to mitigate global warming and quickly build the political will to sharply reduce emissions of global warming pollution. I was wrong — not wrong that deniers would propose adaptation as an alternative to mitigation, but wrong in not immediately grasping the moral imperative of pursuing both policies simultaneously, in spite of the difficulty that poses.”Of greater interest to many readers than the largely technical debates over species diversity and the side effects of fracking will be Gore’s view of the influence of technological innovation on politics. Drawing on H. G. Wells’s notion of a “world brain,” Gore proposes that a virtual “Global Mind” is being created by the Internet and other technologies, even as transnational corporations and supply chains are creating a globalized Earth Inc. While Gore’s language is often fresh and arresting — “Democracy and capitalism have both been hacked” — his treatment of globalization as an almost irresistible force, for good or evil, has been the conventional wisdom at Davos, Aspen and other gatherings of the policy-making jet set since the 1990s.In the chapter entitled “Power in the Balance,” Gore defends the thesis that the nation-state, while still the dominant form of political organization, is losing authority and power to “multinational corporations, networked entrepreneurs and billions of individuals in the global middle class.” He acknowledges the role of what he calls “state-guided capitalism” in the economic rise of China and other East Asian countries, but maintains without much argument that “the emergence of Earth Inc. is more responsible for this phenomenon.”While his discussion of state capitalism is perfunctory, his discussion of political nationalism, like many such arguments, is bedeviled by terminology. He writes: “From Kurdistan to Catalonia to Scotland, from Syria to Chechnya to South Sudan, from indigenous communities in the Andean nations to tribal communities in sub-Saharan Africa, many people are shifting their primary political identities away from the nation-states in which they lived for many generations.” But it’s important to distinguish between multinational states like the Soviet Union, Yugoslavia or Sudan and nation-states with clear ethnic majorities: the major geopolitical trend of our time has surely been the peaceful or violent replacement of multinational states by smaller, more homogeneous nation-states like Kazakhstan, Slovenia and South Sudan, a trend that represents a renaissance, not a withering away, of nationalism.Gore insists that “because nation-states retain the exclusive power to negotiate policies and implement them globally, the only practical way to reclaim control of our destiny is to seek a global consensus within the community of nations to secure the implementation of policies that protect human values.” His somewhat Malthusian anxiety about the sustainability of human population and economic growth is matched by an optimism about the power of global public opinion reminiscent of Woodrow Wilson and other progressives from a century ago.Nonetheless, even the most skeptical realist must concede Gore’s point that there have been “many examples” of an international consensus advancing human rights long before the arrival of the Internet. “The abolition movement, the anti-apartheid movement, the promotion of women’s rights, restrictions on child labor, the anti-whaling movement, the Geneva Conventions against torture, the rapid spread of anticolonialism in the 1960s, the ban on atmospheric nuclear testing and successive waves of the democracy movement — all gained momentum from the sharing of ideas and ideals among groups of committed individuals in multiple countries who pressured their governments to cooperate in the design of laws and treaties that led to broad-based change in much of the world.”Gore concludes: “The outcome of the struggle to shape humanity’s future that is now beginning will be determined by a contest between the Global Mind and Earth Inc. In a million theaters of battle, the reform of rules and incentives in markets, political systems, institutions and societies will succeed or fail depending upon how quickly individuals and groups committed to a sustainable future gain sufficient strength, skill and resolve by connecting with one another to express and achieve their hopes and dreams for a better world.” Whether the forces of enlightened public opinion will prevail over clashing values and conflicting interests remains to be seen."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/yourtaxes/taxpayers-are-still-awaiting-a-simpler-system.html,"IF 2012 was the beginning of a long, inevitable slide toward tax increases, 2013 might just turn out to be the lurching start of tax reform.For more than a decade, lawmakers in both parties have lamented the complexity of the federal tax code, even as they layered on new deductions, credits and variable tax rates intended to reward some activities and punish others.The deal struck by the White House and Senate on New Year’s Day to head off the huge tax increases of the so-called fiscal cliff actually made matters worse on the complexity front. The highest marginal tax rate was increased to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for couples earning over $450,000 ($400,000 for individuals). In doing so, however, negotiators increased the total number of tax brackets to seven from six.Tax rates on capital gains and dividends for families earning less than that $450,000 threshold remain at 15 percent, but those who earn more will have some of their investments taxed at 20 percent. And personal exemption and tax deduction phase-outs, known as PEP and Pease, are coming back starting at incomes as low as $250,000. President George W. Bush banished those in 2001. (PEP stands for personal exemption phaseout, and Pease for former Representative Donald J. Pease, the Ohio Democrat who created the deduction cap.)The changes may sound like enough to make you ditch your tax-preparation software and run screaming as fast as you can to a professional accountant.But by the end of the year, efforts in both the House and Senate to overhaul the tax code, simplify it and strip out many bewildering and contradictory tax breaks might bear fruit. That’s because both political parties have an incentive, although not the same incentive, to move forward.“Tax reform is alive and well,” said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “There’s such a need to simplify the code, to help the code be more competitive, to address a lot of inequities,” he said, adding that because the New Year’s tax deal did practically nothing to close loopholes and unclutter the tax code, “the road is clear.”Republicans are being driven by a long-held desire for simplification, pressed hard by the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan. Conservatives in the House have been clamoring to take on tax reform since they swept to power in 2010. And after a year of listening sessions, tutorials and hearings, Mr. Camp and the rest of the House Republican leadership want to move forward.For Democrats, it’s mainly about the money. The deal to avert the fiscal cliff contained tax rate increases, which President Obama has been demanding since his 2008 run for the White House. But the rate increases were not as inclusive as those he had campaigned for — he wanted tax rates to rise on incomes above $250,000, dividends to be taxed as ordinary income and inherited estates to face considerably higher rates and lower exemptions from taxation than the final deal demanded.On the estate tax, Mr. Obama wanted to subject the value of estates over $3.5 million to a 45 percent tax, higher than the 2012 level of 35 percent on estates over $5 million. The final deal did get a higher rate — 40 percent — but kept the exemption at $5 million, or $10 million for married couples, indexed for inflation. With that indexing, the exemption comes in at about $5.1 million for 2012 — double for a couple — a level that exempts all but a tiny number of inheritances. By raising taxes on incomes over $400,000, Congress also effectively raised only the top marginal income tax rate, not the top two, as the president and most Democrats had wanted. (It is the “marginal” rate because it applies only to income above a certain threshold.)Raising tax rates further won’t be simple, said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who as a leader of the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has spent more than a decade examining tax shelters and dodges. The only way to raise more revenue for deficit reduction at this point, he said, lies with a tax code overhaul that curtails or eliminates breaks that favor the affluent and hits corporations that use offshore tax structures to shelter profits.Think mortgage interest deductions for second homes, the low “carried interest” tax rate paid by many private equity fund managers who take their fees in the form of capital gains skimmed off their clients’ earnings, or post office box subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands. There could even be some limit on deductions for charitable giving.“To me this is not about tax increases,” Mr. Levin said. “This is tax-avoidance termination, long overdue.”The maneuvering over these issues is well under way in Congress. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Senate Democrats hoped to pass a budget blueprint this spring that would include a parliamentary device called reconciliation to put tax reform on a fast track. Under reconciliation, a Congressional budget gives instructions to the tax-writing committees to draft legislation that saves (or costs) a specific amount of money over the window of the budget, usually 10 years.Reconciliation protects that legislation, drafted later in the year, from a filibuster in the Senate, meaning that it could pass with a simple, 51-vote majority. Mr. Bush passed his large 2001 and 2003 tax cuts under these terms. Now Democrats want to turn the tables and use the tactic to raise revenue. They have yet to say how much, but Mr. Obama’s last offer to Republicans for a deficit-reduction “grand bargain” asked for $1.2 trillion in new revenue over 10 years. The tax increases of the New Year’s deal raised about half that much, so another $600 billion in revenue through tax reform is a likely target.But Mr. Schumer’s suggestion has created its own problems. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the finance committee, said the reconciliation device would poison any tax reform effort, leaving Republicans feeling strong-armed and voiceless.“I know Chuck wants to order the committee to do what he wants it to do,” Mr. Hatch said of the Schumer plan. “But that isn’t the way it’s going to work. In fact, that’s the way to create chaos.”The House budget, likely to be passed by April 15, will also include tax reform instructions. But the House’s version would raise no more revenue than the current tax code — albeit at the higher level of the post-fiscal-cliff tax regime.In normal times, Senate and House negotiators working out a final budget blueprint for both chambers might be counted on to split the difference, say, with a plan that raised $300 billion over 10 years. But these are not normal times, and Republicans in the House and Senate say that when it comes to taxes, they have given in enough.Moreover, the white-shoed tax lobbyists of K Street are already circling the Capitol, seeking to protect the tax breaks that their clients have paid them to protect. Before a formal push for tax reform even begins, a coalition of universities, philanthropies and others have all but made sure that no real harm will come to the deduction for charitable giving, for example. And electric power utilities have banded together to protect the low rate on dividends, saying that most dividends go to ordinary retirees, not the superrich.To those who remember the struggle with lobbyists over the 1986 tax-code overhaul, 2013 is developing into “Showdown at Gucci Gulch II.” Then again, no one gave the 1986 tax reform effort much chance at success — yet it was enacted.“There are a lot of crosscurrents here: the need for revenues, spending cuts,” Mr. Baucus said of the task at hand. “There’s just a lot going on.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/opinion/sunday/after-ron-paul-then-what-for-libertarians.html,"RON PAUL, Republican of Texas, has retired from the House, after winning more than two million presidential primary votes in 2012. He took the party’s libertarian wing from ignorable fringe to significant faction. His son, Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, is angling to lead that faction, very possibly as a presidential candidate himself.The libertarian wing’s dissatisfaction with Mitt Romney led the Libertarian Party to earn 1.2 million votes in the presidential election for its candidate, the former New Mexico governor (and former Republican) Gary Johnson. That was its largest vote total ever. In at least seven national House and Senate races a Libertarian beat the spread between a winning Democrat and a losing Republican. From the Republican point of view, losing the libertarians can mean losing elections.“There’s a whole swath of people not getting adequate attention from Republicans or Democrats,” Senator Paul told me recently. These are independent voters who want to seriously cut government spending the way the Tea Party faction does but who also want a “foreign policy more of defense and less offense,” as Senator Paul put it, and a “more socially tolerant attitude.”Senator Paul, who sits on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, tried this week, in a talk at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, to become the voice of a new vision of Republican foreign policy. Rejecting the neoconservatism that has dominated Republican foreign policy thinking since at least 2001, Senator Paul summoned the spirit of George F. Kennan, the author of America’s cold war policy of containment, to suggest that the United States can manage Islamic terror, and even possibly a nuclear Iran, without necessarily waging open war.Senator Paul said that he agreed with those who say that “Western occupation fans the flames of radical Islam.” That opinion turned many Republicans against his father. Senator Paul’s speech pushed a less interventionist foreign policy in terms designed to appeal to Republicans. The Constitution, after all, dictates that Congress, and not the president alone, should decide when we go to war. With the debt crisis, the United States simply can’t afford all its current and possible future military interventions. Fiscal conservatism, by this line of thinking, means peace.Just as his father made “Audit the Fed” a popular cause, Senator Paul told me in January, “I think I can do the same with ‘Audit the Pentagon’ ” and fold defense cuts into his party’s conception of fiscal responsibility.Ron Paul’s son is not his only legacy in Washington. A small group of freshman or second-term representatives he endorsed are admired and scrutinized by his supporters. The most prominent House “Paulite” is the second-termer Justin Amash, of Michigan. There is a new breed of Republicans who “are much more libertarian in their views and have the debt as their primary concern and will fight to protect civil liberties,” Mr. Amash told me last month. “It’s only a matter of time before these individuals work their way up in ranks and become leaders.”Mr. Amash embraces the libertarian label. “In my district, people have a good idea what it means: limited government, economic freedom, individual liberty,” he says. “They see I’m against wasteful spending and for protection of civil liberties.” Mr. Amash relishes how his libertarianism marks him as a rebel in his own party. He was booted in December from his Budget Committee seat by the Republican House leadership for, he says, voting against leadership-approved budgets that didn’t shrink spending enough for his taste. Then Mr. Amash encouraged a revolt against House Speaker John A. Boehner in his January speaker election. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a Ron Paul-endorsed freshman, voted for Mr. Amash over Mr. Boehner. Mr. Amash says that the leadership’s anger pleases his constituents; they are “excited about my independence, excited to have a representative fighting for them and not just following the party line on everything.”While Senator Paul and Mr. Amash alienate some Republicans, libertarian stands against policies like the bailouts and the federal drug war have potential crossover appeal for Democrats and independents. “If we are ever going to win in California again, or Washington, we need someone who is a libertarian Republican,” Senator Paul told me.The party that nominated Mr. Romney, and that gave only 16 Senate votes in May 2012 to Rand Paul’s five-year path to a balanced budget, might not agree. The consistency of the libertarian philosophy — roughly, that government exists only to protect citizens’ lives and property from assault — leads them to buck party discipline on spending. Senator Paul was among the few Senate Republicans who voted against the fiscal cliff deal. It also leads them to oppose civil liberties encroachments like the Patriot Act and the indefinite detention provisions of the National Defense Authorization Act and to condemn “crony capitalism” as exemplified by the Troubled Asset Relief Program and other government bailouts they see as illegitimately serving Wall Street and banking interests.Mr. Amash is sure that libertarian consistency helps him, and could help the Republican Party. “It gives you credibility with people who might be mistrustful because you are Republican,” he told me. “It shows you are serious about following the Constitution and defending American people’s liberties.”Ron Paul understood his mission as educational, not just political. He thought more Americans needed to be taught the economic and ethical benefits of a government that pretty much leaves us alone. His successors optimistically think Americans will embrace their libertarianism; more important, they are sure Americans need to, to avoid a fiscal and debt crisis they fear intensely.“We need to institute a gradual solution for entitlements” like increasing retirement ages, Senator Paul says, “or we might need quick ones.” He sees debt and potentially inflationary Federal Reserve policy not as abstract problems but as possible triggers for “1923 Germany in the United States.”This acute sense that our budget and fiscal problems are not just political games, that we face economic destruction of historic proportions, energizes the world that arose around Ron Paul, even as it risks striking the average voter as manic. Mr. Amash echoes that sense of crisis: “Hopefully, a lot of people who have been recently elected understand the dire consequences of failing to get our fiscal house in order. But whether we’ll get enough people in positions of influence within the party structure fast enough to make these changes, I don’t know.”Mainstream party leaders are blaming failures with technology and grass-roots organizing for their party’s bad results in 2012. The libertarian wing argues instead that Republicans need to separate a core limited-government constitutionalism from the obsessions of other party factions, whether it’s the social traditionalism of the religious right (losing its grip on a changing America) or an expansionist foreign policy (unaffordable and dangerous). At stake, they think, is not just their party’s viability, but America’s solvency. From the libertarian point of view, we might soon be facing the choice of Rand Paul 2016 or bust."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/us/politics/gabrielle-giffords-prepares-to-fight-gun-violence.html,"TUCSON — Gabrielle Giffords looked slightly stricken as she considered the question: Would she feel bad about starring in a political advertisement against her former House colleagues who declined to stand with her on guns? “Yes,” she said, it would be painful.“Sometimes you have to do things that are hard,” said Mark E. Kelly, Ms. Giffords’s husband, as she tucked herself close to him on their couch. Ms. Giffords nodded, as she often does when Mr. Kelly — as he often does — intuits the many thoughts she is still unable to express fully. “Really hard,” she added.Ms. Giffords, a former Democratic congresswoman from Arizona, a gun owner, an astronaut’s wife, a shooting survivor and an incipient gun-control advocate, is settling into the third act of her public life.Her career as a lawmaker is behind her, but so is her role as the fragile, slightly mysterious victim in the months after she was shot point-blank in a parking lot here just over two years ago. Now, she is the face and emotional dynamism behind a new advocacy group and a separate political action committee, Americans for Responsible Solutions, dedicated to reducing gun violence. It is an effort, she said, that gives her “purpose.”Ms. Giffords’s hair, short and wispy for some time after her brain surgery, has returned to its natural bounce. Once heavily guarded by Capitol Police officers and a stream of medical professionals, Ms. Giffords now lives with Mr. Kelly and his 15-year-old daughter, Claire, and Nelson, her service dog, in a modern adobe-style house they bought in August, decorated with bright, large-scale paintings and sculptures.Ms. Giffords’s ability to understand others is unscathed. During a two-hour interview here, she talked about whether she missed Washington (“a little”); explained, in short phrases, her positions on firearms; and made a sly one-word joke (“wasteland”) about one of her least favorite places. She revealed the provenance of some of her paintings (her old Congressional office), pointed out one that was PG-13 (a semiabstract nude), and lamented what a recent frost had taken from her garden. Once limited to two words — “what” and “chicken” — each month she gains more.Speaking in full sentences is still a struggle, and she has regular therapy sessions to help recover her speech and to manage her other impairments. Her vision is impaired, and her right leg and arm are largely paralyzed. She can move her shoulder, her hip and slightly her foot.The rest of her time is largely spent preparing for the legislative battles, political campaigns and potential face-offs with friends and former colleagues that will be waged through her month-old organizations. She and Mr. Kelly are already looking at governor contests, Congressional special elections and 2014 races. They hope to influence the outcome by leveraging the power of their names and their story, an effort presaged last month when Ms. Giffords lit up a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing with her brief and powerful plea: “We must do something.”“Sometimes there will be some difficult conversations,” Mr. Kelly said. “There already have been.”For nearly two decades, the National Rifle Association has succeeded in rewarding lawmakers who backed legislation supporting gun rights and firearm manufacturers and punishing those who did not. Those efforts largely overwhelmed the voices on the opposing side.But after the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn., in December that left 20 elementary school pupils dead, Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly — with several others like Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York — are trying to sway races from the other side.Mr. Bloomberg’s political action committee, Independence USA, was widely credited with bringing an end to the career of Representative Joe Baca, Democrat of California, last year after it spent $3.3 million on television ads and mailers attacking him. That political action committee is now focusing on Debbie Halvorson, a Democratic former congresswoman who is running in a special election to succeed former Representative Jesse L. Jackson Jr. in the Chicago area.The Coalition to Stop Gun Violence recently ran newspaper advertisements against Senator Heidi Heitkamp, a freshman Democrat from North Dakota who has been critical of President Obama’s legislative proposals to curtail some guns, and made a video criticizing Representative John Barrow, Democrat of Georgia, a strong advocate of gun rights.The Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal group, has run an ad attacking Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, for his positions on guns.These efforts are “one of the most important things that has happened,” said Dr. Garen J. Wintemute, the director of the violence prevention research program at the University of California, Davis. “What has been completely missing is the financial counterweight to the N.R.A.”Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly are particularly focused on two areas that Mr. Obama is pushing: an enhanced system of background checks that would prevent more criminals and the mentally ill from buying guns, and a limit on the capacity of magazines.“A universal background check would have directly affected what happened here in Tucson,” Mr. Kelly said, referring to the shooting in which six people were killed and many others, including his wife, were injured. The gunman, Jared L. Loughner, had been suspended from community college for behavioral reasons.Ms. Giffords’s two organizations have already raised millions of dollars from small online donations and from bigger gifts, including $1 million from Steve and Amber Mostyn, Houston trial lawyers, and a six-figure donation from Mr. Bloomberg. The political action committee will hold a fund-raiser before the State of the Union address on Tuesday night in Washington at one of Ms. Giffords’s favorite restaurants.“We’re going to have to have money to be effective,” Mr. Kelly said.Mr. Bloomberg brings some of his substantial fortune to the cause, Dr. Wintemute said, but “what he is not, and what Gabby Giffords and Mark Kelly are, are personally compelling representatives of the position that firearm violence need not be tolerated.”The paradox of Ms. Giffords’s role is clear. As a gun owner (she and her husband went target shooting just a few months ago) and a Westerner whose recovery has been watched closely across the nation, she is an effective spokeswoman for some changes to gun laws. Yet speaking is still her hardest task.Mr. Kelly, a retired astronaut and former naval aviator who has emerged as a forceful, politically astute advocate for his wife’s cause, fills in the verbal blanks on conference calls and in meetings with donors and members.Their partnership evokes that of James S. and Sarah Brady, who became advocates for gun control after Mr. Brady, the White House press secretary, was shot during an assassination attempt on President Ronald Reagan in 1981. Like Ms. Giffords, Mr. Brady was a well-liked and piquant personality whose injuries brought attention to gun violence. In many ways, Ms. Giffords seeks to build on the Brady Act, which created a background check for gun buyers, by making that requirement universal, including for private sales.Mr. Kelly offers shades of the astronaut John Glenn, who headed up the Emergency Committee for Gun Control after the shooting deaths of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Political operatives on both sides of the aisle in Arizona widely expect Mr. Kelly to eventually run for office himself, something he has waved off for now.Ms. Giffords’s liability is in some ways her best asset; her labored speech is a stark reminder that even a member of Congress can be gunned down in broad daylight by someone who is mentally ill and armed with high-capacity magazines. Her short plea to Congress that “you must act” was the most memorable moment of a several-hour Senate hearing. “With just a few words,” said John Feinblatt, Mr. Bloomberg’s chief policy adviser, “she was able to express the feelings of a nation.”Their uphill battle is bringing along lawmakers who feel pressed by the N.R.A. to resist enhanced background checks and limits on high-capacity ammunition, as Ms. Giffords once did.“Gabby, as a member of Congress, knows where they are coming from,” Mr. Kelly said. “We believe strongly that the Second Amendment affords every American the right to defend their home and defend their property with a gun. But there needs to be reasonable limits.”Ms. Giffords’s face lit up with joy when her mother, Gloria, a tough Arizona ranch dweller who can talk with great authority about the proper way to remove a mountain lion lurking in the yard, arrived for dinner. The older Ms. Giffords, whose property is still used by Ms. Giffords and Mr. Kelly for target shooting, said she had thought very little about the gun issue until her daughter was shot.“It’s very difficult to return to some type of peace of mind,” she said. “You feel something has been taken from you, besides the vitality of your child, but also your sense of justice, your sense of rightness in the world.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/opinion/sunday/india-in-the-slow-lane.html,"India’s economy is about to clock its slowest annual growth rate in a decade. The government said recently that gross domestic product would likely grow at just 5 percent in the fiscal year that ends in March, a sharp fall from the 9-plus-percent growth rates of the mid-2000s.This slowdown should alarm the government of Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, who has been far too timid in addressing the country’s economic challenges. It will be particularly devastating for the hundreds of millions of Indians who are struggling to lift themselves out of poverty; this growth rate means that the country’s per-capita income is growing at just 2.9 percent a year.This weakness should also worry the rest of the world, which increasingly needs India to play a bigger role in the global economy. While India has been hurt by the economic troubles of Europe and the United States, its current problems are largely attributable to the passivity of Mr. Singh and Sonia Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress Party, who put him in the job.Under their leadership, the economy remains hobbled by widespread corruption, counterproductive regulations, weak infrastructure, and government ownership of most banks and many major corporations. As finance minister 20 years ago, Mr. Singh played an important role in freeing some areas of the economy from a stifling “license raj,” in which businesses were required to get government approval to set up shop and even to change production levels. But as prime minister he has done little to follow up on those important early reforms.The finance minister, Palaniappan Chidambaram, appears to realize the urgent need to shore up the economy. In recent months, at his prodding, the government has begun making changes — for example, distributing subsidies like scholarships and pensions directly to citizens instead of channeling them through corrupt bureaucracies.Still, one finance minister cannot turn India around. It will require Mr. Singh and Ms. Gandhi to push for legislative and administrative changes to build roads and rail lines, add capacity to backlogged courts, improve primary education and bring transparency to the corrupt way in which political parties are financed.The money to pay for needed improvements could come from privatizing inefficient state-owned companies and banks. It will be difficult to sell these reforms to Indian political leaders, many of whom are ideologically opposed to the free market or benefit from the dysfunction, but that should not stop the duo from pushing them.India will hold elections next year, and many analysts are already speculating that the Indian National Congress Party could suffer a big defeat because of corruption scandals and its poor record of governance. The party further tarnished its image recently by reacting callously to the brutal rape of a 23-year-old New Delhi student and ordering the police to attack protesters demanding justice. Ms. Gandhi now needs to devote her full attention to reviving India’s economy."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/opinion/sunday/in-bed-with-the-president-of-ghana.html,"WHEN my husband-to-be and I met the Ghanaian politician John Dramani Mahama at a friend’s wedding near Accra eight years ago, I liked him immediately. I kept up with his fortunes mostly through mutual friends, and I was happy to learn in 2009 that he had been elected his nation’s vice president.When I read a draft of his trenchant memoir, “My First Coup d’État,” in 2010, I offered to introduce him to some agents and editors in New York. Many people in the developed world expect African heads of state to be either terse and political or bloated and ideological. The surprise of John Mahama’s book is its tender humanism, and I thought it would go a long way toward breaking down prejudice in the United States.I blurbed the book when it was published last July; I hosted a party to celebrate its publication; I conducted an onstage interview with John Mahama at the New York Public Library and I am thanked in the book’s acknowledgments.Soon after, the Ghanaian president, John Atta Mills, died and John Mahama stepped into the presidency; in December, he was elected to another term. Two weeks ago, the Ghanaian press suddenly exploded with references to Mr. Mahama’s relationship with me.“President John Dramani Mahama has been fingered to be in bed with one Mr. Andrew Solomon, a gay lobbyist,” blared one unfortunately worded report. Another announced, “Andrew Solomon reportedly gathered a few affluent people from the gay community to raise campaign funds for President Mahama with the understanding that when President Mahama won the elections, the president would push the gay rights agenda.” I was reported to have paid $20,000 for copies of the book.The occasion of these revelations was Mr. Mahama’s appointment of what one newspaper called the “fiery human and gay rights advocate, Nana Oye Lithur” to head the newly established Ministry of Gender, Children and Social Protection. In confirmation hearings before a parliamentary committee, Ms. Lithur averred that “the rights of everybody, including homosexuals, should be protected,” thus invoking a firestorm. I was presumed to have pushed through her nomination, even though I had in fact never heard of her. The argument that Ms. Lithur was selected not for her formidable skills, but because of a foreign devil fit with the continuing position among some Africans that homosexuality is an import from the decadent West.I have neither the ability nor the inclination to meddle in foreign elections, and I paid not one red cent for the book John Mahama inscribed to me. The only way I may have influenced him on gay rights was by welcoming him into the household of a joyful family with two dads. It is deeply unsettling to be implicated in a national scandal, to know that my attempts to be kind and helpful to someone would become his millstone.On Friday, Feb. 1, the president’s spokesman said that President Mahama didn’t know me. On Saturday, the president called me to apologize. On Sunday, the government issued a statement that Mr. Mahama and I know each other, that I have never made a campaign contribution or persuaded anyone else to do so, and that President Mahama “does not subscribe to homosexualism and will not take any step to promote homosexualism in Ghana.” I am not sure what is involved in promoting homosexualism, but I am pleased to know that a cordial friendship with me does not constitute such an act.The situation of gay people in most of Africa is deplorable, and the double talk from the Ghanaian administration has done little to assuage valid concerns. In the wake of this brouhaha, I have received hundreds of letters from Ghanaians via my Web site and Facebook. Half are from gay people about how dire their situation is. One said, “I am tired of this humiliation and embarrassment. I don’t know whether if I am a gay I am not a living being. I have tried to pretend to be what they wanted. I need your word of advice and help. Sorry to say I feel like committing suicide. My tears are dropping so badly that I have to end my e-mail here.”But the other half are from straight allies, of whom there appear to be legions. One woman complained, “Men are deceiving me too much, so I want to join your LGBT please.” My favorite was, “I wish God has blessed me like you. I am not a gay but I respect and love so so much. May you live to always help mankind.”By curious coincidence, this whole matter has unfolded while I am in India promoting a book that deals in large part with how any condition may go from being perceived as an illness to being lived as an identity. It draws on my experience of such a transition for gay people in the United States. When I first visited India, some 20 years ago, the only clearly gay people were destitute and marginalized. On my second trip, in the late 1990s, I met a subculture of rather soigné gay people, but their faces flushed whenever the thing we had in common was acknowledged. At the Jaipur Literature Festival last month, the “gay panel” attracted more than a thousand people who complained of the hideous prejudice they faced in India — but who were emboldened to object publicly to the problem in a tone that anticipated its ultimate resolution.In Ghana, the articles that attacked President Mahama for knowing me referenced “the raging national debate on gay and lesbian rights” in Ghana. That there is such a debate — even if it’s a debate about whether to lynch us — is meaningful progress. The fact that local propagandists can plausibly suggest that the president of a West African country is in the hands of gay lobbyists reflects a changing world. I hope that President Mahama will seize this occasion to take a leadership role in the region on L.G.B.T. rights. The fact that so many people from his country wrote to me when the scandal broke indicates that many are thinking through these issues. I hope the time is not far off when to know someone like me will be less of a liability and more of an asset."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/us/politics/florida-republicans-brace-for-greer-trial.html,"ORLANDO, Fla. — The surroundings are far from opulent and the cocktails will have to wait, but as political events go, this one is expected to draw a who’s who of present and past Florida political notables: a former governor, a former State House speaker and a former State Senate president are all expected to drop by, and the current State House speaker, too.But none of the name-brand politicians, including former Gov. Charlie Crist, are actually eager to attend the gathering, which will require swearing to tell the truth, the whole truth, and answering hostile questions, all from a chair inside an Orlando courthouse.This Monday begins the long-awaited trial of Jim Greer, 50, a flamboyant former chairman of the Republican Party of Florida. Mr. Greer, who was chosen for the job by Mr. Crist, was indicted in 2010 on charges of fraud, money laundering and theft. Prosecutors accuse him of steering $125,000 of party money to a personal account in 2009 through a shell fund-raising company, Victory Strategies, of which he was a secret co-owner.But Mr. Greer maintains that politics, not criminal wrongdoing, is to blame for his downfall. His ouster, he has said, was engineered by a cabal of Republican conservatives who despised Mr. Crist and resented Mr. Greer’s steadfast support of the governor during his unsuccessful 2010 run for the Senate — first as a Republican, and then as an independent — against Marco Rubio.Damon Chase, Mr. Greer’s lawyer, said that Mr. Greer’s fund-raising actions were legal and aboveboard, and that Victory Strategies was no secret. Florida Republican officials were aware of its existence, he said. Those officials are now being called to testify for both the defense and the prosecution.“This case is outrageous,” Mr. Chase said. “It would have never been brought had it not been just a political vendetta against Greer for supporting Crist over Rubio.”The trial is expected to rummage through the messy — some say unethical — inner workings of the party from 2007 to 2010, back when Mr. Crist still called himself a Republican (he is a Democrat now) and when Mr. Rubio was an underdog candidate.The prosecution’s main witness in the case is Delmar Johnson, who was Mr. Greer’s top aide in the Republican Party. Prosecutors say Mr. Johnson set up Victory Strategies with Mr. Greer and also benefited from it. He will receive immunity for his testimony against Mr. Greer.“This trial won’t be good for anybody,” Mr. Greer warned in an interview with The Miami New Times last month. “People need to know what goes on behind the curtain in the Republican Party, and before the Republicans tried to destroy me, they should have thought about what the consequences were going to be.”Among the people who Mr. Greer said knew of the Victory Strategies contract was Mr. Crist, his onetime stalwart ally.“Three of Crist’s closest friends have given sworn testimony that Crist not only knew about it but authorized and approved of it,” said Mr. Chase, Mr. Greer’s lawyer.Mr. Crist, who is on the witness list and is said to be considering another run for governor, has said he did not know anything about Victory Strategies or that Mr. Greer was taking a cut of the money for personal use.“Mr. Crist says this is not true; he has been pretty clear about it from the very beginning,” John Morgan, Mr. Crist’s lawyer, said of Mr. Greer’s accusations. “Charlie doesn’t have anything to worry about.”The trial is bad news for most politicians on the witness list — some of whom suffered from hazy memories during depositions — mostly because it dredges up a deeply painful period for the Republican Party.“This has been the ‘Nightmare on Elm Street’ for the Republican Party,” said Jason Steele, who as the party’s executive chairman in Brevard County in 2009 was highly critical of Mr. Greer. “We knew something was wrong, that something was earth-shatteringly wrong with the way the Republican Party was being run. The chairman would show up in limousines to every event, traveling in the highest style. It became a laughingstock. And the rank-and-file Republicans across the state got very, very angry.”Yet what most galled Mr. Steele and many others in the Republican Party about Mr. Greer — in addition to his spendthrift ways — was his open support of Mr. Crist during the 2010 Senate race against Mr. Rubio. In Florida, conservatives dominate the party and were pushing hard for Mr. Rubio, a former State House speaker and Tea Party favorite.“We had a chairman who was absolutely in bed with the governor of the state of Florida, and they were helping each other,” Mr. Steele said.But the trial is bad news for Republicans in general because it is expected to allow Mr. Greer to shine a spotlight on the free-spending ways of Republican leaders at the time. As chairman, Mr. Greer charged nearly $2,000 for a two-day car rental in California and nearly $3,000 for one dinner at the Capital Grille in Orlando, just two examples of his credit card charges. He chartered planes. He spent party money to travel to Las Vegas to attend a Wayne Newton concert and to help pay for his son’s birthday party in Florida.But Mr. Greer, who was ousted as chairman over his spending practices, said he was not alone in racking up expenses.“That’s how political parties do business,” said his lawyer, Mr. Chase, adding that as chairman, Mr. Greer raised record amounts for the party in 2008. “They spend money to woo big donors, and as a result, they raise a lot of money. The money is not public money or tax money. It’s private money being spent by a private organization.”Mr. Greer’s dubious spending tainted top lawmakers, whose credit card expenses also suddenly became suspect. Among them was Mr. Rubio, who was investigated during his campaign for using a Republican Party charge card for personal expenses from 2005 to 2008, including for groceries and flowers. Mr. Rubio has said that the use of the card was accidental and that he paid those charges.The trial is also expected to delve into an unpleasant dust-up over Mr. Greer’s severance pay. Mr. Greer said three top state Republican lawmakers drew up a secret agreement to pay him $130,000 if he resigned. The agreement made mention of fund-raising contracts, which meant that the lawmakers knew about Victory, Mr. Chase said. The payments, though, never arrived and Mr. Greer sued the party.Party leaders initially denied the existence of the contract. Mike Haridopolos, the incoming State Senate president at the time, later acknowledged under oath that he had signed the pact and had not told the truth.The Republican leaders say they knew nothing about Victory Strategies or Mr. Greer’s role in it. “I would use the old adage for this,” said Mr. Morgan, Mr. Crist’s lawyer, referring to Mr. Greer’s claims. “Desperate men do desperate things in desperate times.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/us/politics/in-state-of-the-union-address-obama-will-lay-out-agenda-focused-on-the-middle-class.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama on Tuesday will seek to move beyond the politics of the moment to define a second-term agenda built around restoring economic prosperity to the middle class, using his State of the Union address to unveil initiatives in education, infrastructure, clean energy and manufacturing.Having secured four more years in the White House by arguing that the nation’s economy is tilted against ordinary Americans, Mr. Obama will vow to use the power of his office to recapture robust job growth and economic expansion, according to White House officials who have seen the speech. Both eluded him during his first term.Mr. Obama will insist that only “a thriving middle class” can stimulate long-term growth and that Americans must be given the tools to succeed, according to the officials, who discussed the speech on the condition of anonymity. His call for new government investments — many of which Republicans successfully blocked in his first term — is an effort to shift the emphasis away from simply reducing the deficit and will serve in part as an answer to Republican criticism that he has not focused enough on jobs.“I think you will hear him talk about some new proposals that build on his earlier efforts to help middle-class Americans,” said Nancy-Ann DeParle, who until recently was Mr. Obama’s deputy chief of staff. “I think his message will be — as he is — very positive and optimistic: ‘We’re strong, and we’re moving in the right direction. The economy is improving, but we have more work to do to ensure that all Americans can take advantage of a stronger economy.’ ”White House aides declined to describe the initiatives in the four subject areas, and said there would be other proposals in the address as well. But the officials familiar with the speech said that any proposed spending would be offset by new savings or revenues to avoid adding to annual budget deficits.The president is structuring his fifth annual address to a joint session of Congress around three main economic points: making the nation a “magnet for jobs and manufacturing”; providing Americans the “skills they need” for those jobs; and ensuring that “hard work leads to a decent living,” officials said.Mr. Obama will try to summon the nation’s support for two major initiatives that are already consuming the first weeks of his second term: the passage of stricter gun laws in the wake of the school massacre in Newtown, Conn., and an overhaul of immigration policy that would allow 11 million illegal immigrants to eventually become citizens.He will also confront his looming clash with Congress over taxes and spending next month with a blunt warning to his Republican adversaries — that continued fiscal brinkmanship could cause an economic slump that would be devastating to millions of Americans. He will renew his call for a “big deal” that would lower the deficit by cutting spending, revamping the tax code and making long-term changes to slow the growth in spending for Medicare and to stabilize Social Security.But the main focus of the address, the officials said, will be on finding a new balance in the economy by expanding opportunities for average Americans without saddling the next generation with enormous debt.“Our economy succeeds and our economy grows when everybody is getting a fair shot and everybody is getting a fair shake and everybody is playing by the same rules,” Mr. Obama told House Democrats at a legislative retreat last week, offering a peek at the themes he will discuss on Tuesday night.Mr. Obama’s agenda faces certain skepticism and opposition from a Republican Party that has fought for years against what it views as runaway spending, big government and overreaching regulation. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida will deliver the Republican response.Mr. Obama will not soon get a similar opportunity to shape the trajectory of his presidency. Millions of people are likely to tune in for what has become an annual ritual in which presidents set expectations for Congress, for the public and for themselves.The address, in the House chamber, has evolved into a mix of politics, policy and pageantry, and Mr. Obama will heed modern tradition by hosting a group of Americans whose presence is intended to send a message about his priorities.The president’s speech opening his second term comes amid economic recovery, in contrast with the financial crisis that was the backdrop for his address in 2009. While housing and most other economic indicators point toward slow and steady growth, unemployment remains near 8 percent and is projected to decrease only fitfully.Throughout his presidency, Mr. Obama has struggled to claim credit for economic successes without seeming out of touch with the millions of Americans who remain jobless and frustrated about the pace of improvement in their lives.“One of the hardest things to get right is that one line where you describe, ‘The state of our union is — blank,’ and how you fill in that blank,” said Donald A. Baer, the chief executive of the global public relations firm Burson-Marsteller and a former speechwriter for President Bill Clinton.Last month, in his second Inaugural Address, Mr. Obama made an aggressive case for a liberal agenda that included having greater tolerance toward immigrants, advancing gay rights, preserving the social safety system and confronting climate change. The White House officials said the president viewed Tuesday’s speech as a second act in the same play.For Mr. Obama, the State of the Union address is an oversize opportunity to confront and challenge Republicans directly on issues like immigration, stricter background checks for gun buyers, marriage equality and further tax increases on the wealthy — all issues where the public is on his side, according to polls.On guns, Mr. Obama will renew his call for a broad package of legislation focused on reducing violence by restricting some access to firearms. He will urge Congress to ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons, put limits on high-capacity ammunition magazines, improve background checks and prevent sales of firearms to people with mental illness.In remarks in recent weeks, the president has made it clear that he views universal background checks for gun purchases as the most likely measure to pass in a divided Congress, though aides have said that he would not back away from his support for a new assault weapons ban if it can pass.On immigration, the president will say he intends to make good on his promise to revamp the nation’s immigration system and eventually provide a pathway to citizenship for the millions of immigrants in the country illegally.Buoyed by big support among Hispanics and Asians in his re-election, Mr. Obama is betting that Republicans are ready to join him in that effort. But as in the fight over guns, success may hinge on reaching the kinds of compromises that have proved exceedingly difficult during the past four years.As in previous years, Mr. Obama will not spend much time in the speech focusing on foreign policy, though his administration faces numerous challenges around a complicated world: instability in the Middle East, nagging questions about Afghanistan’s ability to maintain security after American troops leave, growing scrutiny of a continuing drone campaign against terrorists, threats from Iran and North Korea, and increasing global competition from China.A year ago, as he headed into his re-election campaign, Mr. Obama opened his State of the Union address by heralding the death of Osama bin Laden and the shrinking American troop presence in Iraq and Afghanistan.With the election behind him, Mr. Obama could return to some of the promises he made in his first term, including a vow to reduce the world’s nuclear stockpiles and a pledge to work on peace between Israel and the Palestinians."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/world/asia/india-executes-man-tied-to-2001-attack-on-parliament.html,"MUMBAI, India — India hanged a man on Saturday who had been convicted of involvement in a 2001 attack on Parliament that killed nine people.The hanging of the man, Muhammad Afzal, also known as Afzal Guru, a 43-year-old militant with the group Jaish-e-Muhammad, came more than a decade after the Dec. 13, 2001, suicide attack on India’s Parliament, in which five gunmen armed with grenades, guns and explosives opened fire, killing nine people, most of them security officials. The execution drew protests from human rights groups concerned about the growing use of capital punishment in such cases.Mr. Afzal was convicted of conspiracy in the plot and sentenced to death by a special court in 2002. In 2004, the Indian Supreme Court upheld the death sentence.After the execution, clashes broke out in Mr. Afzal’s hometown, Sopore, in the northern part of Jammu and Kashmir State, and the police and paramilitary units were called to restore order. Days before the execution, President Pranab Mukherjee had rejected a plea for mercy from Mr. Afzal’s wife, according to reports from The Press Trust of India, paving the way for his hanging in the Tihar Jail complex near New Delhi, officials said.The clashes in Mr. Afzal’s hometown after his death came despite the imposition of a strict curfew in the region in anticipation of trouble from separatist leaders, according to news reports.The authorities in Srinagar, the summer capital of Kashmir, asked residents to remain indoors and closed the national highway for one day.Omar Abdullah, the Jammu and Kashmir chief minister, appealed for peace and calm.“I understand there is a certain degree of angst and there are some people who would like to take advantage of the situation,” Mr. Abdullah said. “I appeal to the people to allow us to get through this with peace and not to resort to violent protests.”Officials from the ruling Congress Party said the execution was a sign that India would not tolerate acts of terror.“Anybody committing any acts of terror will be punished,” said a Congress Party spokesman, Rashid Alvi. “People of our country and government have zero tolerance for terrorism.”But the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party criticized the government’s delay in carrying out the execution.“The attack on the Indian Parliament happened in 2001, that is 12 years ago, which was an attack on India,” said a party spokesman, Ravi Shankar Prasad.On Nov. 21, India hanged Ajmal Kasab, the only surviving Pakistani gunman from the November 2008 terrorist attacks in Mumbai, ending an eight-year moratorium on the death penalty and drawing criticism from rights groups, which they reiterated Saturday.“The hanging of Afzal Guru, following closely behind the hanging of Ajmal Kasab in November, shows a very worrying trend by the Indian government,” said Meenakshi Ganguly, the South Asia director for Human Rights Watch. “Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as an inherently irreversible, inhumane punishment.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/opinion/a-tax-to-pay-for-war.html,"WASHINGTONNOW that Congress has discarded the idea that taxes can never be raised, we must change how we pay for the wars we ask our military to fight. We should institute a war tax.With leading officials calling for action in Syria, and the American military providing support for France’s intervention in Mali, the need for such a tax is urgent. And President Obama’s call for tax reform as the next round of budget negotiations begins offers a perfect opportunity to enact it.Military spending has been declining since 2009, easing the conflict between pursuing our national security interests and solving our fiscal crisis. But if we undertake new military interventions, that tension will come roaring back.Those who look at our military spending as a percent of gross domestic product and argue that we could spend more are right. At our current level of $646 billion, we are spending roughly 4 percent of G.D.P. on national defense, well below cold war averages. The missing part of their argument is whether we can afford to pay for it now or would have to borrow, adding to the national debt. After all, war spending — like all government spending — wrecks public finances only when more money is spent than is brought in.This simple equation is nothing new. Three years ago, the Senate Budget Committee adopted a bipartisan amendment requiring that wars be paid for. The Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction commission and Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, both proposed doing much the same thing. None of these proposals resolved the question of whether to pay for future wars through spending cuts or raising more revenue. Now that Congress has finally passed legislation letting taxes increase, we must make a choice and require a tax surcharge to pay for any military operation.War traditionally has motivated major changes in tax policy. The Civil War brought the first income tax. World War I made the federal income tax permanent. World War II brought tax withholding. In 1969, at the height of the Vietnam War, the United States ran a budget surplus because of a tax surcharge Congress forced President Lyndon B. Johnson to accept.Today’s budget negotiations offer a similar opportunity to make a surcharge permanent. President Obama called for counting as savings the money that will not be spent as the war in Afghanistan winds down. Many decried the scheme as playing with funny money because he plans to exit Afghanistan in 2014 anyway; the savings only exist because of an accounting trick in Congressional budgeting. But if those savings were associated with an actual policy change, they would start looking more real.Since the Budget Control Act already caps military spending, there is an easy way to implement the surcharge: any spending over the caps would require it. If we felt the need to use the military and could do so under the spending caps, as the Obama administration did in 2011 responding to the earthquake in Japan and the uprising in Libya, no surcharge would be necessary. But if military action required supplemental financing, any amount over the caps would be offset with new revenue raised by an automatic surcharge on taxes.By tying military action to additional revenue, the president would actually have a freer hand in deciding when to use force. Every argument the Obama administration makes for military action would explicitly include a call for increased taxes, forcing the question of whether the stakes in the military situation are worth the cost. If the American people agree they are worth it, the president will get both the political support and financing he needs.Syria is the most immediate example. We now know that some top officials have argued for arming the rebels, as the secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did last year. Others argue for an even more robust military response, while detractors insist that we should learn from Iraq and not get involved at all.Such decisions should not be divorced from economic considerations, but neither should we allow our finances to prevent us from pursuing vital American security interests. Putting in place a permanent tax surcharge to pay for wars would ensure that we could achieve our interests throughout the world without further worsening our finances.If military action is worth our troops’ blood, it should be worth our treasure, too — not just in the abstract, but in the form of a specific ante by every American."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/us/politics/state-of-union-address-language-changed-over-time.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama is likely to declare on Tuesday evening that the state of the union is strong. That word, strong, has become a ritual element of the annual address to Congress, intoned by Mr. Obama and his predecessors over the last 30 years even when things were not going that well.“The state of our union has never been stronger,” President George W. Bush said in January 2002, immediately after reminding Congress that the nation was at war and the economy was in recession.“Despite our hardships, our union is strong,” Mr. Obama said in January 2010, after mentioning that the nation was engaged in two wars and that the economy had fallen into an even deeper recession.Strong, stronger, strongest — one of those words has been used to describe the union in each of the last 17 State of the Union addresses.But it was not always so. Presidents once used other words to describe the state of our union. President Jimmy Carter liked to call it “sound.” President Harry S. Truman liked to call it “good.” President Lyndon B. Johnson, in a lyrical moment, described the state of the union in 1965 as “free and restless, growing and full of hope.”And when things were not going well, they said so.“I must say to you that the state of the union is not good,” President Gerald R. Ford said in 1975, citing high unemployment, slow growth and soaring deficits. He added, “I’ve got bad news, and I don’t expect much, if any, applause.”In 1961, President John F. Kennedy said, “The present state of our economy is disturbing,” declaring that he spoke in “an hour of national peril and national opportunity.”No president has ever delivered a more dour assessment than Andrew Johnson in 1867, as the nation wrestled with the Reconstruction of the Southern states: “Candor compels me to declare that at this time there is no union as our fathers understood the term, and as they meant it to be understood by us.”What changed? The simple answer is President Ronald Reagan.Reagan’s first official State of the Union address, in 1982, was among the bleaker assessments a president has delivered, although it was framed with his trademark optimism. The state of the union, he declared, would be getting better.The following year, he said that it had. “As we gather here tonight,” Reagan told Congress, “the state of our union is strong.”Anthony R. Dolan, Reagan’s chief speechwriter, said that he could not recall who suggested the word “strong,” but that it was a better choice than “good” or “sound” because “it had just a little bit of a moral quality.” Mr. Dolan said he also liked the word because it was “qualitative rather than quantitative” — the union could be strong even if the economy was not.Reagan used the same word, though never in exactly the same way, in several subsequent years.But it was President Bill Clinton who made the phrase a modern standard, declaring that “the state of our union is strong” in each annual address from 1996 to 1999. By January 2000, when the economy was booming, he jettisoned all understatement and grandly pronounced, “My fellow Americans, the state of our union is stronger than it has ever been.”David Kusnet, Mr. Clinton’s chief speechwriter during his early years in the White House, said that he did not recall the decision to use the phrase, but that it was easy to imagine why the choice was made, and repeated, and repeated.“Strong is a tempting word,” Mr. Kusnet said. “It’s simple, declarative. It’s alliterative. And it had the added benefit of being accurate.” He said he saw the phrase as a modern version of President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s formulation that the nation was stronger than its problems.“Since F.D.R., the essence of presidential rhetoric is summoning our national strength to address our national challenges,” said Mr. Kusnet, a principal at the Podesta Group.Mr. Bush also used “strong” and its variants in each of his seven State of the Union addresses. Matthew N. Latimer, a speechwriter in Mr. Bush’s second term, said that in his recollection no one ever proposed a different adjective. “If presidents before you said that the state of the union is strong, you say that it’s strong,” said Mr. Latimer, who now runs Javelin, a ghostwriting firm. “Otherwise someone is going to say, ‘Why didn’t he say that the country is still strong?’ ”Of course, there are risks in such perpetual optimism. Consider the case of President Herbert Hoover, who said in 1928, the last year before the stock market crash ushered in the Great Depression, “No Congress of the United States ever assembled, on surveying the state of the union, has met with a more pleasing prospect than that which appears at the present time.”Perhaps it would be safer to emulate President Benjamin Harrison, who in 1889 wrote to Congress — as presidents did throughout the 19th century — that there was no need for the president to describe the state of the union because “every step taken is under the observation of an intelligent and watchful people.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/world/africa/memo-from-tunis-ennahda-party-rejects-blame-for-tunisias-troubles.html,"TUNIS — Facing public anger and internal divisions after the assassination of an opposition leader, Tunisia’s largest Islamist party, which leads a governing coalition, blamed the news media, secular elites and the remnants of the old government for its troubles.As Tunisians fretted about the specter of political violence, the party, Ennahda, did not seem to look inward. It strongly condemned the assassination, but did not see any blame for the anger in its own actions. But others did.Its implacable critics renewed their charge that the killing was the result of Ennahda’s conservative religious agenda. Others, including supporters of the group, said the movement’s own missteps since coming to power contributed to the public outburst after the politician Chokri Belaid was gunned down last week. The group had lost confidence, some said, by focusing on power rather than on governing.As tens of thousands took to the streets last week and Tunisia’s divisions were laid bare, many waited to see how Ennahda would respond. Would it reach out to find common ground with some of its critics, or would it retreat to its base of support? The challenge resonates here and in Egypt, where the Muslim Brotherhood is facing even harsher questions about its rule.Ennahda’s leader, Rachid al-Ghannouchi, dismissed the criticism, saying that the movement remained popular and that a majority of Tunisians were not afraid of his group. “Just a tiny part of the aristocracy,” he said.Nevertheless, the anger amounted to a humbling setback for Ennahda, which had been in the vanguard of Islamists seeking political power after the Arab uprisings two years ago and had held up its record of building political consensus as a model. After decades of being jailed, or forced underground or into exile by authoritarian leaders, the Islamist groups’ rise to power in Egypt and Tunisia has been swift. So has the reckoning on their rule.“They thought that governing would be easy,” said Abou Yaareb Marzouki, a philosophy professor who is close to Ennahda. “And they imagined that through governance, they will reject forced modernism,” he said, referring to what he called a policy of westernization under colonial rulers and authoritarian governments. But Ennahda and the Brotherhood had swung too far in the opposite direction, he suggested, imposing “forced easternization.”Since the uprising against President Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali two years ago, Ennahda has insisted that whatever the results of elections, it would rule with others and had no intention of imposing a conservative religious agenda. After winning a plurality in Tunisia’s first elections, the party formed a coalition with the center left.Facing challenges that would test any government, the coalition became noted for its incompetence, failing to dent the economic crisis or reform institutions.Ennahda was accused of coddling ultraconservatives, known as Salafis, some of whom have been tied to a string of violent episodes.The blame intensified after the killing of Mr. Belaid, who had received death threats for his criticisms of Islamists. At his funeral on Friday, tens of thousands of mourners directed their anger at Ennahda and Mr. Ghannouchi, blaming them for fostering extremism and taunting the leader with an incendiary chant: “Slaughterer.”Intensifying the pressure on Ennahda, the prime minister, Hamadi Jebali — a top Ennahda leader — defied his colleagues by calling for the Islamist-led cabinet to replaced by technocrats with no political affiliations. Ennahda said it was still considering whether to accept the proposal to reconstitute the government, which many people believe could quiet some of the anger.In an interview on Saturday, Mr. Ghannouchi said Tunisia’s difficulties could be “contained,” saying he was not worried that the country would devolve into violence. “The Tunisian people are known for being peaceful,” he said.He said he was surprised at the accusations against Ennahda, which understood that its success in governing depended on stability. “These kinds of things happen in revolutions,” he said, speaking of the assassination. He avoided Mr. Belaid’s funeral to “avoid tensions,” he said, but was clearly stung by the chants against him, which he called part of a demonization campaign.Mr. Ghannouchi said the party remained “open and accepting,” and said most people were not preoccupied with ideological conflict but with concerns like food and medicine. He blamed a “French model of secularism” for conflicts in Tunisia, and insisted that no more than 20 percent of Tunisians were opposed to Islamist rule. “The rest are against radical secularism,” he said.Khalil al-Anani, a scholar of Middle East Studies at Durham University in England, said the Islamists shared a misconception that by securing electoral victories, they were free to act as they wished. “They replicate the policies of authoritarian regimes, and underestimate the weight of secular and liberal forces.” And they did not understand how the uprisings had changed the structures of power. “No one can claim the authority of the street in the Arab world,” he said.Abdulbasset Belhassan, the president of the Tunis-based Arab Institute for Human Rights, said the Islamists “are facing a strategic choice — between keeping an ideological approach based on their old legacy, or entering a new era based on human rights and democracy.” “They should take a historical decision,” he said. “The revolution was not made by one party.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/politics/senate-panel-tackles-immigration.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama’s nonconfrontational tone on an immigration overhaul in his State of the Union address on Tuesday night probably did more to advance the issue, lawmakers said, than if had he offered a fierce rallying cry, as he did about gun restrictions.As senators gathered Wednesday for the first hearing on the proposed sweeping changes in immigration law, they said the president’s decision to give members of both parties room to maneuver on the delicate politics of immigration was a strategic choice that could pay off as negotiations continued.“He’s walking a tightrope here, trying to allow Congress on a bipartisan basis to come up with a comprehensive immigration reform bill in the Senate,” said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the No. 2 Senate Democrat. “He encouraged us, told us he doesn’t want this to drag on forever, and if we can’t get it done he’ll play more forceful role.”Mr. Durbin, a member of a bipartisan group of eight senators working on an immigration bill, added, “The reason he’s on this tightrope is the Republicans don’t want to make it appear that they are bending to the president on this issue.”Influential Republicans praised Mr. Obama as well. Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party’s vice-presidential nominee last year, said the president’s tone on immigration was measured and constructive.“I thought on immigration he used the right words and the right tone, which tells me he actually doesn’t want to politicize this, which is conducive to getting something done,” Mr. Ryan said.Given their losses in the Congressional elections in November, Republicans in both the House and Senate have demonstrated a new openness to immigration changes that could lead to legal residency for millions who have entered the country illegally. At the same time, polls have shown that the president’s involvement in the debate decreases Republican support.White House officials said the president was just as aggressive on immigration as he was on firearms, though his appeal for changes in gun laws was one of the emotional peaks of the night.Cecilia Muñoz, director of the White House Domestic Policy Council, said immigration was “an issue on which we expect an outcome and we expect it soon.”The president, who most recently laid out his own immigration principles in a January speech in Las Vegas, told Congress on Tuesday night that “the time has come to pass comprehensive immigration reform.” It was a refrain he repeated several times to applause.Mr. Obama proceeded to highlight what he believed are the three goals of any immigration deal — ensuring that the borders are secure, creating a meaningful path to citizenship, and overhauling the system to deal with legal immigration. But when talking about immigration, he seemed to lack the emotional resonance, not to mention the forceful call to action, that he exhibited when discussing gun control, where he exhorted the country to remember that all victims of gun violence “deserve a vote.”Which may have been exactly the point.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, began his remarks at Wednesday’s hearing by thanking the president for his State of the Union comments on immigration.“His remarks last night on immigration were just right,” Mr. Schumer said. “He importuned us to act, he stated how important it was to get this done for the future of America, but at the same time he did not make it a wedge issue. He made it clear that we had to act in a bipartisan way and gave us, in our little group, the space to come up with a bipartisan proposal, which we know is really our only hope.”Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, and a member of the bipartisan group, said he had “no complaints — actually I thought it was good for the process.”“If he were to be seen as leading the effort, it likely wouldn’t be that helpful,” Mr. Flake said. “But to say that he’ll sign the bill we put on his desk, that’s helpful.”The hearing focused largely on border security and enforcement, with an entire panel devoted to just one witness — Secretary Janet Napolitano of the Department of Homeland Security. Ms. Napolitano said that border security was often used as an excuse to prevent meaningful changes.But in a glimpse of the debate to come, Ms. Napolitano met resistance from key Republicans — including Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, the committee’s ranking member, and Senator John Cornyn, Republican of Texas — over enforcement. “I do not believe that the border is secure,” Mr. Cornyn said. “And I still believe we have a long, long way to go.”The four Democratic senators in the bipartisan group — Senators Michael Bennet of Colorado and Robert Menendez of New Jersey, as well as Mr. Durbin and Mr. Schumer — were to meet with Mr. Obama at the White House on Wednesday evening to discuss the group’s progress. They hope to introduce their legislation in March."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/100th-self-immolation-inside-tibet-is-reported.html,"A former Tibetan Buddhist monk protested Chinese rule by killing himself through self-immolation this month, becoming the 100th person to do so inside Chinese-governed Tibet, according to reports on Wednesday by Tibet advocacy groups.The Tibetan man, Lobsang Namgyal, 37, formerly of Kirti Monastery, set fire to himself on Feb. 3 in front of an office of the public security bureau in a county of Sichuan Province and died on the scene, according to Free Tibet, which is based in London. Free Tibet said in a news release that it had taken 10 days to confirm the self-immolation “because Tibetans are too frightened of Chinese state reprisals to speak about protests.”Another advocacy group, the International Campaign for Tibet, reported that monks living in exile in India who had received word of the self-immolation had said that during the act, Mr. Lobsang Namgyal called for the long life of the Dalai Lama, the spiritual leader of the Tibetans.The monks, who live in Dharamsala, India, the seat of the Tibetan government in exile, come from the same monastery as Mr. Lobsang Namgyal, and said he had been an exceptional student chosen to study for a Geshe degree, the highest qualification in Tibetan Buddhism.“He was regarded as a model for a new generation of students at Kirti,” the monks said in a statement translated by the International Campaign for Tibet.The monks said Mr. Lobsang Namgyal had disappeared in September and was believed to have been temporarily detained in Sichuan Province by local security forces. Officials had sought to isolate him and ruin his reputation, they said, and he continued to be under intense surveillance even after leaving for a rural nomadic area. His family had also come under pressure.The wave of self-immolations in Tibet, which began in 2009, has brought into sharp relief the intense frustration and defiance of Tibetans, whose vast homeland came under Communist rule after Chinese troops occupied central Tibet in 1951. At least 82 of the 100 self-immolators have died.Earlier Wednesday, a Tibetan man walked onto a street in Katmandu, the capital of Nepal, which borders Tibet, and set himself on fire. He was the latest of a half-dozen Tibetans to immolate themselves outside Tibet in protest against China. Nepal is home to thousands of Tibetan exiles.The authorities said the man, who witnesses told The Associated Press had been wearing monk’s robes, was hospitalized in critical condition. The witnesses said the man had shouted slogans against China before falling to the ground.The protester, who had not been identified, set himself ablaze near a Buddhist stupa in the Boudhanath area of Katmandu, where many Tibetans live. He timed his act to coincide with the important Tibetan festival of Losar, or the Tibetan New Year. Those still in Tibet have not observed the festival since a widespread uprising against China in 2008, and the government in exile, in solidarity, has asked other Tibetans not to celebrate it.Nepal is pinched between China and India and for decades has served as a way station for Tibetans escaping Chinese rule. In recent years, Chinese leaders have pressured Nepal’s government to choke off this flow of refugees and to limit political protests by Tibetans living in Nepal, which has resulted in growing frustration among those Tibetans.Lobsang Sangay, the prime minister of the Tibetan government in exile, expressed sadness about the self-immolation in Nepal and said his administration had asked Tibetans not to take drastic actions. But he also placed the blame for such acts on the Chinese government.“The occupation of Tibet and repression of Tibetans are the primary reason for the self-immolations inside Tibet,” Mr. Sangay said by e-mail while visiting the United States. “The solution to the tragedy in Tibet lies with Beijing, and my administration is fully committed to dialogue and to address the issue peacefully.”Chinese officials in Beijing and in Dzorge County of Sichuan Province, known as Zoige in Chinese, where Mr. Lobsang Namgyal died, could not be reached for comment. Government offices in China are closed for the lunar new year holiday.Chinese officials in the past said the self-immolators were mentally unstable or blamed outside agitators. Despite the accusations, Chinese officials have never provided evidence of any connection between the acts and the Dalai Lama or other Tibetan leaders in exile. Recently, Chinese officials have tried pressing a campaign to criminally prosecute people tied to those who immolate themselves; as a result, several monks have been given harsh prison sentences.Security forces have also flooded towns in parts of the Tibetan plateau where the self-immolations have been common. But nothing the authorities have done has curbed the acts, which are being committed by a wide range of Tibetans, from young men to middle-aged parents. They have taken place mostly in eastern Tibetan, known as Kham and Amdo to Tibetans and now part of the Chinese provinces of Sichuan and Qinghai.“There has been clear evidence from at least some of the immolators themselves that they have acted as they have in order to demonstrate resistance to Chinese rule,” said Elliot Sperling, a scholar of Tibet at Indiana University. “The fact that these immolations continue even now, after China has opted for a harsh crackdown in areas that have witnessed these acts, is telling.”Another scholar, Tom Grunfeld at Empire State College of the State University of New York, said that people on the outside had been generally “stumped as to what’s driving this,” but that what was interesting was “how helpless the Chinese state is in combating this.”So fearful are Chinese officials of the self-immolations and the message they send that the officials have even put fire extinguishers in Tiananmen Square in Beijing, thousands of miles from where the acts have occurred. Chinese leaders are sensitive to the fact that protesters across China often try to make their way to the square. Officials in Tibetan regions have also equipped security forces with fire extinguishers and put them in monasteries.Officials have tried to prevent foreigners from traveling to the sites of the self-immolations.Tibetans interviewed last year in Dharamsala said the security crackdown after the 2008 uprising had contributed to a growing spirit of defiance among Tibetans. The first self-immolation in Tibetan regions was by Tapey, a monk from Kirti, in February 2009. He survived. The next self-immolation occurred outside Kirti in March 2011.Kirti monks in exile said Mr. Lobsang Namgyal had returned to Kirti days before his death and told some people that he wanted to go on a religious retreat."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/movies/awardsseason/screenwriting-lincoln-argo-and-zero-dark-thirty.html,"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — As “Zero Dark Thirty,” his narrative about the hunt for Osama bin Laden attracts scrutiny, the screenwriter Mark Boal has consoled himself with brouhahas of movies past. Warren Beatty came under fire for “Bonnie and Clyde,” in which he starred, because it was considered sensationalist and was pilloried for glamorizing violence. Demonstrators protested the depiction of the Vietnam War in “The Deer Hunter,” and protesters were arrested outside the 1979 Oscars. “Apocalypse Now” was a cultural punching bag for years during its much-delayed production. All of these films were, of course, judged differently by history.Mr. Boal, an Oscar winner for “The Hurt Locker” and a nominee this year, wasn’t comparing his work to those films, he was quick to add in an interview here. But in terms of cinematic maelstroms, he said, “that puts me in some pretty good company.”From its inception “Zero Dark Thirty” was a flash point, initially criticized, sight unseen, by Republicans who expected a pro-Obama interpretation. Since its release liberals have taken issue with its depiction of torture, and three senators have raised questions and begun a formal investigation about the C.I.A.’s cooperation with the filmmakers. But it is just one of the films that have drawn unusual attention from Washington this Oscar season, whether that means presidential seals of approval (for the nominees “Beasts of the Southern Wild” and “Lincoln”) or Congressional and diplomatic screenings (“Lincoln,” “Zero Dark Thirty,” “Argo”).Beltway pitstops are rare for Oscar-nominated movies, but campaigners in awards and politics have a fair amount in common. Both are eager to stay on message, burnishing egos while advancing the angle they prefer. And just as Washington types try to shape the official record, filmmakers this season have had to defend their views of history and manage the tension between truth and creative license.Chris Terrio, the “Argo” screenwriter, was drawn to that story, about the daring 1980 rescue of six Americans during the Iranian hostage crisis, partly because it presented an example of how to extricate America from conflict in the Middle East, something much on his mind when he began writing it in 2008. “When I first read the story,” he said, “I thought, here’s an American intelligence success, an operation that was successful abroad that used only creativity and intelligence to get people out of harm’s way, using nonviolent means.”In adapting the story of the C.I.A. operative Tony Mendez, Mr. Terrio and Ben Affleck, the director, did ratchet up the tension, and “Argo” has drawn criticism for fudging facts, like a third-act sequence in which armed Iranian guards chase the departing Americans’ plane down the runway. That never happened. Many of the other dramatic details — a late telegram from President Jimmy Carter, for example, greenlighting the operation — did, though not necessarily in the time frame on screen. Mr. Terrio said that he and Mr. Affleck heavily debated what was in and out of bounds, girding themselves for dispute.“We didn’t casually make those artistic decisions,” he said. “We wouldn’t have had explosions or gunshots and people shooting at the plane. There were certain things that strayed too far from dramatic license.” The liberties they took, he said, were meant to illustrate “an invisible threat” — the Americans’ fear of being caught. Dramatizing that was especially crucial because the audience already knew the ending.Similarly, in “Lincoln,” the screenwriter Tony Kushner changed the historical record on the Congressional vote for the 13th Amendment. In his version two representatives from Connecticut opposed it, effectively approving slavery. Mr. Kushner was taken to task by Joe Courtney, a Democratic congressman from Connecticut, who said it was a slight to the state’s history. Mr. Kushner responded with alacrity, noting that he also changed the delegates’ names “so as not to ascribe any actions to actual persons who didn’t perform them” (truth in ethos if not in fact).“These alterations were made to clarify to the audience the historical reality that the 13th Amendment passed by a very narrow margin that wasn’t determined until the end of the vote,” Mr. Kushner wrote in an open letter to Mr. Courtney.Few people, he argued, were put off by the disparity, though drawing attention to it on the eve of the final round of Oscar voting raised hackles. (That Mr. Affleck had once campaigned for Mr. Courtney was quickly noted by awards watchers and insiders, and just as quickly dismissed by Mr. Courtney and representatives of Warner Brothers, the “Argo” studio.)Though “Lincoln” came wrapped in the authority of the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose best-selling “Team of Rivals” served as a basis for the script, Mr. Kushner calls it a “historical fiction,” a category that gives him leeway to dramatize and invent. He strove to banish any editorializing from the script, often at the behest of Steven Spielberg, the director, but did find a contemporary context for it in the election of President Obama.In an interview he called working on the film during the Obama era “a gift” that changed him, his view of politics and, consequently, the screenplay. “I certainly came to understand a lot watching the president, watching a progressive centrist negotiating, not just with an absolutely determined radicalized right wing, but also negotiating in a sense with the political left, which now as then displayed a tremendous amount of impatience with the democratic process,” he said.Along with several prominent lawyers who specialize in First Amendment cases Mr. Kushner signed his name to a letter in support of “Zero Dark Thirty,” sent to the Senate this week. The letter takes issue with criticisms by Senators Dianne Feinstein, Carl Levin and John McCain, who called the film’s depiction of torture “grossly inaccurate and misleading.” The senators demanded that Sony, the studio behind it, correct the impression that torture led to actionable intelligence in the hunt for Bin Laden.Mr. Boal and Kathryn Bigelow, that film’s director, have taken an increasingly vocal stance on their freedom of expression as filmmakers, condemning torture but arguing that it belongs in their story, based on reporting by Mr. Boal (gathered from “firsthand accounts,” as the title cards put it). If he didn’t include enhanced interrogation techniques, he said, “I’d be getting another accusation, which would be massively whitewashing history.”“If it’s so fictional, why are they investigating the sourcing?” he said, referring to the senators. “Why are they asking the C.I.A. where this information came from? If it’s as fictional as an alien robot movie, what’s the problem? Or is it that we actually cut a little too close to the bone, and there’s a narrative that doesn’t want to be challenged?”As the film has filled theaters, other officials have stepped up to vouch for it. Leon E. Panetta, the outgoing defense secretary and a former C.I.A. director (played in the movie by James Gandolfini), has praised it for explicating the hunt well. Jane Harman, a former nine-term congresswoman who served on House security committees, called it “magnificent,” according to The Hollywood Reporter. Nancy Walbridge Collins of Columbia University and Michele Malvesti of Yale, both security and foreign affairs experts and professors, worried that its main flaw was in exposing too many government secrets.“If you took away my concerns about security, I thought they had done a pretty terrific job,” Ms. Walbridge Collins said in an interview. Though she also had some reservations about details, “for me, broadly, they captured the story accurately.” She added that the film’s quick path to the screen indicated that it was the kind of story — a successful raid, clear victors — that those working in intelligence were eager to have told.For Mr. Boal, who said he felt his responsibility as a storyteller “acutely,” the criticisms have only served to bolster his convictions. “Even though a lot of people have taken runs on the film and said a lot of things, to me the script still stands,” he said.That “Lincoln,” “Argo” and “Zero Dark Thirty” have succeeded at the box office and with industry accolades, he added, means that serious filmmaking, the kind Hollywood sharpened its teeth on in the 1960s and ‘70s, still has potency.“It works as business, and it works with audiences, and it works with critics, and I don’t know what more you can really ask for,” he said. “It might not win every news cycle. That’s O.K. too.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/politics/david-leonhardt-washington-bureau-chief-answers-readers-questions.html,"David Leonhardt, Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, answered readers’ questions on Thursday about the economic landscape and President Obama’s prospects to enact the ambitious legislative agenda he laid out in his State of the Union address.Mr. Leonhardt is the author of the e-book, “Here’s the Deal: How Washington Can Solve the Deficit and Spur Growth,” published by The Times and Byliner. Previously, he wrote the paper’s Economic Scene column.Below are answers to selected questions. Q.     So presidents make their State of the Union speech then hit the road to sell it. Wouldn't it be more effective to just stay in D.C. and do the heavy lifting of pushing Congress off of square one?  A.  My colleague Michael Shear writes from Georgia, where is he reporting on President Obama’s trip today:Recent presidents have made a habit of getting out of Washington to pitch their State of the Union ideas in front of largely friendly crowds who can -- the White House hopes -- put some political pressure on the lawmakers in Washington. Bill Clinton did it after proposing health reform (with little success). George W. Bush did it, too, after proposing Social Security changes (also with little success).For Mr. Obama, staying in Washington is exactly what he doesn't want to do. He and his aides became frustrated in his first year by the endless health care negotiations that made him feel trapped in the weeds of a political process for which Americans don't have good feelings. The White House staff and the president have concluded that more time outside Washington will actually help the gridlocked process of legislating, by potentially putting political pressure on legislators.There is a downside, though. The visits have a decidedly campaign-like feel that can lend credence to the accusation that the president is more concerned about political appearances than the business of governing. Mr. Obama has concluded that risk is worth it. But it's not clear from recent history that the trips have actually helped achieve a president's goals. Q. When the debt was the largest in history as a percent of GDP, in 1946, we had 27 years of mostly deficit spending. The debt in dollars doubled. But we had prosperity. Why don't we do that today?  A.  You're right that a country can have deficits and still pay down its debt, so long as the deficits are small enough and economic growth fast enough. And you're right that some government spending plays a crucial role in creating economic growth. The most important programs seem to be investments -- in education, scientific research, roads, bridges and the like -- that the private sector won't do on its own.The Internet, the radio, the jet engine, much of biotechnology and the technique for extracting a form of natural gas known as shale gas all owe their beginnings to federal spending. This history is a major theme in ""Here's the Deal.""But government spending and debt most certainly do not ensure prosperity. Federal debt is already high. The projections showing that annual deficits will fall in the next few years depend on some assumptions that may prove rosy. And as more baby boomers retire and health costs keep rising, projected deficits are projected to rise again, sharply, in coming decades.As heartening as the recent progress on the deficit may be, the country still faces substantial long-term fiscal problems. If we don't deal with them, we are likely to have an economy that looks nothing like the prosperous economy after World War II. Q.     Congressional Republicans recently decided against using the debt limit as a lever to force President Obama to enact spending cuts he wouldn't otherwise go along with. Is there any indication that Republicans will agree to a longer-term extension once the current limit is reached?  A.  It's hard to know, but it's possible that the debt-ceiling fights will not continue. In the past, the extension of the debt ceiling tended to be an opportunity for the party that didn't hold the White House to grandstand about the deficit and debt. (President Obama, somewhat famously, did so in 2006.) In the end, though, the extension tended to pass without any concessions from the president.In 2011, Congressional Republicans successfully negotiated such concessions from Mr. Obama. In recent months, he made clear that he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling again, citing the economic damage from the uncertainty over the last extension. Republicans have gone along, at least temporarily.Polls suggest the last fight hurt Republicans more than Democrats, which suggests Republicans may ultimately agree to a long-term extension or simply a series of short-term extensions. On the other hand, they were indeed able to win some spending cuts in 2011, so some in the party continue to see the debt ceiling as a powerful tool.The most cliched last line in journalism -- the kicker, as we say -- is: Time will tell. I can't think of another kicker here. Q.     Why has the administration given so much focus to gun control in the past few weeks? With a Republican majority in the House and the fact that many Democrats would also vote against advanced gun control measures, would this kind of legislation have a chance of passing the House or the Senate?  A.  Unlike past mass shootings, the killings in Newtown, Conn., shifted the national debate. Public opinion changed modestly, and Democrats who favor more gun control became more willing to push for it.As you note, most Republicans and some Democrats oppose sweeping new measures, which is why an assault-weapons ban still seems unlikely. But some other measures may be able to win overwhelming support from Democrats and enough from Republicans to pass both the House and Senate. The two leading candidates are an expansion of criminal background checks on people buying guns and a new federal trafficking law to block criminal purchases.A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 85 percent of Americans favor background checks. Support at so high of a level, combined with national attention to the issues, has the potential to create a majority in both houses of Congress. Q.     The Wall Street macro indexes e.g. S&P500, DOW, are at or around historical highs. However I do  not see corresponding growth in GDP let alone increase in employment rate to underpin this rally.What is driving this and where is the money coming from? How does this benefit ""middle America""?  A.  First, the indexes themselves are not at or near record highs when viewed properly. When adjusted for inflation, the Standard & Poor 500 index was more than 30 percent higher in 2000 than it is today. Including the value of dividends, the S&P was still about 5 percent higher in 2000 than now. And taking into account investment costs, which nearly everyone pays, the gap would be substantially more than 5 percent.I say this not to be an inflation nerd (though I am) but to make the point that the stock market is not in fact more valuable than it’s ever been. When Wall Street proclaims, “record high!” and we in the media repeat the claim, we’re presenting a false picture of reality. Stocks are still not as valuable as they were at the peak of the dot-com bubble.Your larger point, though, is dead on. The S&P 500 (including dividends and inflation) is about 18 percent higher than it was five years ago, which is roughly when the recession began. The overall economy has not fared nearly so well. Gross domestic product was only about 2 percent larger at the end of last year than five years earlier. The unemployment rate is 7.9 percent, up from 5 percent five years ago.For a complex stew of reasons – including, but not limited to, government assistance for the financial sector since 2007 – American companies and financial firms have recovered more quickly from the crisis than most of the rest of the economy. Q.     What are President Obama's plans to lure high-tech manufacturing back to the United States? He courts Silicon Valley and named Apple during his State of the Union, but Steve Jobs famously said manufacturing will never return for logistical reasons. Tim Cook, despite the return of a single Mac line, appears to have little desire to change the company's strategic plan.  A.  My colleague Annie Lowrey responds:President Obama's White House is sold on the idea that high-tech manufacturing punches above its weight, economically speaking, by boosting American innovation and competitiveness. Thus, the White House has pushed hard for what amounts to an industrial policy for manufacturing, a policy shepherded by Gene B. Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council.The ideas are many. The White House has proposed billions of dollars of tax credits, an $8 billion ""community college to career"" fund, worker training initiatives, tax reforms and trade policy measures, all aimed at creating or keeping manufacturing jobs.But the implemented policies are few, given the need for Congress to pass and fund many of them. Still, the Obama administration has devoted federal dollars to promote promising nascent technologies and to developing industrial ""clusters,"" for instance.Moreover, the 2009 stimulus bill contained billions of dollars of support for green-energy projects, often with manufacturing components. It's also worth noting that there are billions of dollars of pre-existing tax credits and programs that aid companies that make their products in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels. Q.     Would increasing minimum wage be effective at raising the standard of living? Wouldn't costs just shift with it?  A.  History suggests pretty clearly that an increase in the minimum wage would help the great majority of workers now earning the minimum wage. Increasing the minimum wage may lead to some job loss, but it does not appear to lead to large amounts of job loss, research has found. Most employers instead absorb the costs of the higher wages.The higher wages may come out of a business’s profits (and, by extension, the income of the business’s owners or stock holders). Or, as your question suggests, the higher wages may come out of consumers’ pockets, via higher prices.The net effect is roughly the same, though. An increase in the minimum wage shifts some income now flowing to high- and middle-income workers to low-income workers instead. An increase in the minimum wage, in other words, seems to have a bigger effect on the distribution of the nation’s economic pie than on the size of it.But the increase proposed by President Obama, to $9 an hour, almost certainly would not erase the large shift in income away from low-income workers in recent years. Over the last 25 years, household income at the 10th percentile – that is, among those households earning less than nine out of 10 others and more than one out of 10 others  – has increased only 2 percent, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Census Bureau. At the median, the increase has been 3 percent. At the 95th percentile, the increase has been 23 percent. And for the very rich, the increases have been larger still. Q.     Has the atmosphere in Congress become any less toxic in the aftermath of President Obama's reelection?  A.  I don’t know about toxicity, but it has become less predictably partisan. Some Republicans have become more willing to negotiate with the administration, rather than to stand on principle and oppose it.Why? In the first term, Republicans decided that they held veto power over perhaps President Obama’s central promise: to be a bipartisan bridge builder. As Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, told my colleagues Carl Hulse and Adam Nagourney in 2010, a bill is “either bipartisan or it isn’t.” By uniformly opposing the president’s agenda, Republicans thought they could frustrate his liberal aims, make him seem ineffective and deny him a second term.Once he won a second term, the party’s strategy shifted somewhat. Republican leaders were well aware of polling showing that most voters viewed them as less willing to compromise than Mr. Obama. Some Republicans also came to lament that they did not negotiate more on the health-care overhaul and other bills, which would have allowed them to win more concessions. So on a couple of recent bills – an effective tax increase on the affluent, aid for the aftermath of the Sandy storm – some Republicans have become more willing to make a deal. Others in the party have continued to vote no but have allowed bills to pass.Will it continue? It depends how long Republicans see compromise as being in their interest – and whether Mr. Obama and the Democrats, newly emboldened, push so hard on various items that they leave Republicans no room to compromise comfortably. Immigration seems the most likely area for further compromise, given the Republican need to improve their image among Latinos. The budget is another possibility."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/politics/hearings-begin-on-treasury-nominee.html,"WASHINGTON — Jacob J. Lew, President Obama’s nominee for Treasury secretary, faced some fierce questioning on Wednesday from the Senate Finance Committee on his tenure at the bailed-out Citigroup and on an investment based in the Cayman Islands. But the even-tempered, bookish Mr. Lew parried the blows and appeared likely to win the committee’s approval and Senate confirmation.“Frankly, I think you’ve done really well today,” said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the committee. “My gosh, I have nothing but respect for people like you who give yourself to our government.”Many questions from Senate Republicans seemed intended to rankle or ruffle Mr. Lew and score some political points. Senator Richard M. Burr of North Carolina asked about the Benghazi attack in Libya. Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, referring to Mr. Lew’s lucrative but short time at Citigroup, commanded him to “explain why it might be morally acceptable to take close to a million dollars out of a company that was functionally insolvent and about to receive a billion dollars of taxpayer support.”Mr. Lew calmly responded, “I was compensated for my work. I’ll leave for others to judge.”He emphasized that he had worked in operations at Citigroup, albeit for a time at an investment unit that made proprietary trades on behalf of the bank.“I was not in the business of making investment decisions,” he said. “I was certainly aware of things that were going on. I was working in a financial institution. I learned a great deal about the financial products. But I wasn’t designing them and I wasn’t opining on them.”Aside from his time on Wall Street from 2006 to 2008, Mr. Lew has spent most of his career as a Democratic budget official — and the White House chose him in no small part for that experience. Much of his testimony focused on the trillion-dollar budget battle he would face immediately after becoming secretary. On March 1, automatic cuts to military and nonmilitary programs, known as the sequester, will start to take effect. Republicans and Democrats are both struggling to unwind or delay them, with hundreds of thousands of jobs at stake.Mr. Lew said Congress needed to undo the sequester. He also said political dysfunction in Washington was threatening the real economy.“The short-term-crisis, deadline-driven practices that we’ve seen over the last couple of years are undermining the economy,” Mr. Lew said. “It’s the first time in my nearly 30 years in public life that I felt that the actions of government were actually working against the goal of getting the economy moving.”Mr. Lew also described tax reform as a top priority, with an eye to raising more money, lowering rates, reducing loopholes and generally rationalizing the code. He said cutting the tax rate on corporate income to 25 percent from its current 35 percent would be difficult. He also called for a minimum tax on foreign profits. And he said there was “room to work together” on creating a tax system in which income is taxed only in the country where it is earned, a change long sought by large American companies that operate around the world.Over and over, Mr. Lew asserted his longtime budget bona fides and willingness to work with Republicans. “Working across the aisle while serving under President Clinton, I helped negotiate the groundbreaking agreement with Congress to balance the federal budget,” he said in his opening statement. He added that he had been involved in “almost every major bipartisan budget agreement over the last 30 years,” and that “the things that divide Washington right now are not as insurmountable as they might look.”But as one of Mr. Obama’s main budget negotiators in the last few years, Mr. Lew has at times clashed with Republicans, particularly in the House. Former Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner, not Mr. Lew, acted as a main negotiator during the talks over the automatic tax increases and spending cuts, the so-called fiscal cliff, that Congress cut a deal to avoid last month.During the hearing, Republicans also targeted a money-losing investment Mr. Lew had made in a fund based in the Cayman Islands. Mr. Grassley noted that Mr. Obama had derided Ugland House, which provides an address for thousands of investment entities — including the fund Mr. Lew bought into — and said he saw some hypocrisy in Mr. Lew’s nomination, given the investment.But the attacks seemed mostly tactical. “Jack Lew paid all of his taxes and reported all of the income, gains and losses from the investment,” said Eric Schultz, a White House spokesman. “There are no new facts that provide a basis for senators to reach a different conclusion about Mr. Lew’s nomination than they reached twice before in this administration.”Some senators — including Jeff Sessions, Republican of Alabama, and Bernard Sanders, the left-leaning independent from Vermont — have said they do not support Mr. Lew. But it seemed unlikely that he would face a filibuster that might delay his confirmation or end his candidacy.“Mr. Lew has been confirmed by the Senate three times already,” Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana and chairman of the Finance Committee, said in a statement released before the hearing, referring to Mr. Lew’s service in both the Obama and Clinton administrations. “I don’t expect there to be any reason why he should not be confirmed this time around as well.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/politics/senate-democrats-accusing-gop-of-obstruction-try-to-force-hagel-vote.html,"WASHINGTON — Accusing Republicans of a new level of obstruction, Senate Democrats moved on Wednesday to force a vote on President Obama’s nomination of Chuck Hagel to be secretary of defense.Mr. Hagel’s nomination was endorsed by the Senate Armed Services Committee along party lines on Tuesday. But with Republicans demanding more information before allowing a vote on Mr. Hagel by the full Senate, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the majority leader, took procedural steps to limit floor debate on his nomination and bring the partisan clash to a head by Saturday.“This is the first time in the history of our country that a presidential nominee for secretary of defense has been filibustered,” Mr. Reid said on the Senate floor. “What a shame. But that’s the way it is.”Republicans, sensitive to the accusation that they were filibustering Mr. Hagel, tried to draw a distinction between a filibuster and delaying the vote because of unanswered questions.“There’s nothing unusual about this,” said Senator James M. Inhofe, the senior Republican on the Armed Services Committee, who on Tuesday suggested without evidence that Mr. Hagel was “cozy” with Iran, an accusation that caused the committee meeting to erupt with Democratic outrage. “There’s not a filibuster,” he added.Even if Republicans succeeded in dragging out the vote into the weekend, Democrats said they remained confident that he would be confirmed by Saturday because Republicans did not appear to have the 40 votes necessary to block the nomination. Such a move would be an extraordinary step, and one that Republicans seem wary of taking should they find themselves in the White House four years from now.Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, meanwhile, said on Wednesday that he intended to try to block the nomination of John O. Brennan, Mr. Obama’s choice to be director of the C.I.A., until Mr. Brennan provides answers to questions he had on the scope and legality of the Obama administration’s drone operations. Democrats have also sought to extract more information from the White House about those operations.Senator Dianne Feinstein of California, the Intelligence Committee chairwoman, said she expected to schedule a committee vote on Mr. Brennan’s nomination when the Senate returned from recess the week after next. She said that Mr. Brennan would make a “strong and capable C.I.A. director.”According to the Senate’s historian, Donald A. Ritchie, only 5 percent of presidential cabinet nominees have been blocked or rejected by the Senate. Only twice since 1917, when the Senate’s modern filibuster rules were created, has a cabinet-level nominee been subject to a supermajority vote of 60, as Republicans are forcing with Mr. Hagel.In the case of Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, the opposition is especially striking because senators have traditionally afforded their former colleagues a high level of courtesy. But many Republicans still nurse a grievance against Mr. Hagel for his opposition to the war in Iraq, and others have sought to make an issue of statements he has made on Israel and Iran. Senators Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and John McCain of Arizona want the Obama administration to provide information about the timeline of its actions on the day of the attack on the American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya, an episode that has become a point of conservative ire against the president.When Mr. Hagel testified before the Armed Services Committee he was pummeled.As Mr. Obama’s counterterrorism adviser, Mr. Brennan has been the chief architect of the administration’s drone policy, and his nomination has focused new attention on it. In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Mr. Obama said that he planned in the coming months to work with lawmakers to “ensure not only that our targeting, detention and prosecution of terrorists remain consistent with our laws and system of checks and balances, but that our efforts are even more transparent to the American people and to the world.”White House officials on Wednesday did not give any details about Mr. Obama’s plans for more transparency about the targeted killing program, which has long been shrouded in secrecy.Democrats on the Senate Intelligence Committee have expressed frustration that the White House has not allowed lawmakers to read the legal memos, written by the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel, which provide the justification for the targeted killing operations in Pakistan, Yemen, Somalia and elsewhere and that have been expanded during the Obama administration.The committee said that the Justice Department had written 11 secret legal memorandums related to the targeted killing of terrorism suspects but said the Obama administration had shown the committee only four of them.Senator Feinstein did, however, provide new details about the extent to which her committee has been briefed by the administration about drone strikes.“The committee has devoted significant time and attention to targeted killings by drones,” she said in a statement. “The committee receives notifications with key details of each strike shortly after it occurs, and the committee holds regular briefings and hearings on these operations” to review their basis and effectiveness.She added that Intelligence Committee staff members had held 35 monthly oversight meetings with government officials “to review strike records (including video footage) and question every aspect of the program.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/nyregion/ex-senator-shirley-huntley-pleads-guilty-in-2nd-fraud-case.html,"A former New York State senator pleaded guilty on Wednesday to falsifying evidence in an attempt to cover up the theft of taxpayer money from a nonprofit agency that she founded, ending a prominent corruption case that included charges in federal and state courts.The former senator, Shirley L. Huntley, a Democrat who represented Queens, told a judge in State Supreme Court in Nassau County that she drafted and backdated a letter in March 2011 to create a false record that the nonprofit agency, Parent Workshop Inc., held an event that never actually happened.The agency was ostensibly dedicated to helping parents navigate the school system, but prosecutors said employees there and at another nonprofit organization she ran stole more than $100,000 in state grants instead of spending the money on programming.In the Nassau County case, Ms. Huntley, 74, was not accused of stealing the money herself but rather of covering up $30,000 in thefts by others. Her actions came to light after a joint investigation by the state attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, and the state comptroller, Thomas P. DiNapoli. Mr. Schneiderman filed the charges.In the related case in Federal District Court in Brooklyn, prosecutors accused Ms. Huntley of herself pocketing taxpayer money from her other nonprofit agency, Parents Information Network Inc. Two weeks ago, Ms. Huntley pleaded guilty in that case and admitted to stealing more than $87,000 in state grants to pay for shopping for herself and her relatives.As part of the federal plea agreement, Ms. Huntley will pay the state the full amount she stole. She faces up to two years in prison under the federal sentencing guidelines for the charge, conspiracy to commit mail fraud. Sentencing is scheduled for April 4.Prosecutors in the state case recommended a sentence of five years’ probation because Ms. Huntley already faces federal prison time. She is to be sentenced on the state charge on March 29.“It is unconscionable that an elected official would deliberately tamper with a law enforcement investigation into the theft of taxpayer dollars,” Mr. Schneiderman said in a statement. “My office’s partnership with the comptroller is designed to combat such corruption, and we will work tirelessly to protect every penny of taxpayer money during these challenging economic times.” "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/asia/incoming-south-korean-president-steps-up-criticism-of-pyongyang.html,"SEOUL, South Korea — In her harshest criticism yet of North Korea, the incoming president of South Korea, Park Geun-hye, warned on Wednesday that the North’s pursuit of nuclear weapons would bring its government “self-destruction.”Ms. Park’s comment came a day after North Korea defied worldwide warnings Tuesday by detonating what it called a miniaturized atomic bomb in its third nuclear test.It remained unclear how close North Korea has come to building a nuclear warhead small enough to fit onto intercontinental ballistic missiles — seen as the ultimate goal of the North’s nuclear and missile programs. But the latest detonation was more than a nuclear test; it also tested the abilities of the new governments in the region to tame the North’s nuclear and missile ambitions.The test led to a new chorus of international outrage and threats of more sanctions, even though such responses have had little to no effect on North Korea’s behavior after its previous tests.But as the North steps closer to the weaponization of its nuclear devices and missile tests, some hard-line members of Ms. Park’s governing Saenuri Party called for South Korea to secure its own “nuclear deterrent,” while the main opposition party urged Ms. Park to help defuse the tension by sending a special envoy to the North.“No matter how many nuclear tests North Korea conducts to bolster its nuclear capabilities, it will eventually bring itself self-destruction by wasting its resources,” Ms. Park was quoted as saying by her office during a meeting with her national security and foreign affairs advisers on Wednesday. “Nuclear weapons did not prevent the old Soviet Union from collapsing.”Her comment followed — and echoed the tone — of President Obama’s warning to North Korea during his State of the Union address on Tuesday. North Korea’s provocations “will only isolate them further,” Mr. Obama said. “We stand by our allies, strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats.”Mr. Obama spoke by phone with the departing South Korean president, Lee Myung-bak, on Tuesday, and afterward, the White House made a rare public gesture of reaffirming American’s “nuclear umbrella” over South Korea.Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta also joined the chorus of criticism. Describing North Korea as “a threat to the United States, to regional stability, and to global security,” Mr. Panetta, at a Pentagon news conference, issued a warning to the leadership in Pyongyang.“Make no mistake,” he said. “The U.S. military will take all necessary steps to meet our security commitments to the Republic of Korea and to our regional allies.”Ms. Park, who replaces Mr. Lee on Feb. 25, had been careful not to criticize North Korea. During her campaign for her December election, she opposed unconditional aid and economic investments of the sort championed by her liberal rivals, insisting that North Korea must first win the South’s “trust” by easing its hostilities. But she also criticized the Mr. Lee’s hard-line policy as failing to change North Korea’s provocative behavior.Ms. Park shifted to a firmer stance after the nuclear test.She said that a central principle of her North Korea policy has been to “make sure that North Korea pays for its provocations while assuring opportunities and assistance if it chooses to become a responsible member of the international community.”“But if the North pours cold water, it will affect our approach,” she added. “Even if it conducts fourth and fifth nuclear tests, they will do nothing to boost its bargaining position.”Also on Wednesday, South Korea’s Defense Ministry said that North Korea’s growing missile and nuclear threats compelled it to accelerate the building of new ballistic missiles capable of reaching all of North Korea.Last fall, the United States agreed to allow South Korea to extend the range of its ballistic missiles up to 500 miles, enough to reach any target in North Korea.The North’s detonation also added urgency to the “Korea Air and Missile Defense” system, which South Korea plans to build to guard itself from North Korea’s short-range ballistic missiles, said Kim Min-seok, a ministry spokesman, during a media briefing on Wednesday.Mr. Kim said South Korea had “doubts” about the North’s claim to have successfully tested a “miniaturized and lighter” atomic bomb that could theoretically be used atop missiles. North Korea still needed more time to reach that goal, he said.Ships, airborne sensors and ground-based monitors from North Korea’s neighbors tried on Wednesday to collect air samples that may give them answers to questions surrounding the North Korean blast. A key question is whether the device detonated used some of the North’s limited stockpile of plutonium or was a uranium bomb, which would be proof that the country has acquired a second, and more accessible, source of nuclear bomb-making materials.Mr. Kim, the ministry spokesman, said no telltale air samples had been collected as of Wednesday. Experts say it takes two to four days for radioactive gases to leak out from an underground nuclear test. By then, they are harder to detect. In its 2009 test, North Korea plugged its underground testing tunnel so tightly that no radioactive gas escaped."

New light is thrown on the mystery to-day by Commander Evans, the successor to the command of the expedition. In a long cablegram from New Zealand, the “Daily Express” says, he explains that the shortage of fuel was due to the failure of the party to keep up to the average speed expected on the return journey.1938 Congress Favors Limiting World ArmsWASHINGTON  —  Congressional sentiment in favor of a new world arms limitation conference, started off by the announcement of Senator William H. King (D., Utah) yesterday [Feb. 12] that he would introduce a resolution tomorrow authorizing President Roosevelt to call such a parley, grew by leaps and bounds today. A number of other Congressmen greeted the idea with enthusiasm in the hope that a means might be found of forestalling the big new naval building program of the United States, as well as a general armaments race.1963 De Gaulle’s Son-in-Law Tells of ShotsPARIS  —  The special military court trying 15 men accused of attempting to kill President Charles de Gaulle last August today [Feb. 13] heard testimony from his son-in-law describing the Chief of State’s dash to safety through a hail of machine-gun bullets. Col. Alain de Boissieu, who occasionally acts as his father-in-law’s aide-de-camp, said: “I heard gunfire and saw bullets ricocheting. ‘Step on it,’ I told the chauffeur. I asked the general and Mrs. de Gaulle to duck. They didn’t obey immediately. Then I saw that the window nearest Gen. de Gaulle was broken.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/debt-mounting-postal-service-asks-to-alter-business-model.html,"WASHINGTON — Saying that its debt could reach $45 billion by 2017 if Congress does not act, the Postal Service on Wednesday called on lawmakers to give it the flexibility to change its business model to keep itself solvent.During a hearing before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee, Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general, asked Congress to give the Postal Service permission to run its own health plan for employees and retirees, modify a Congressional mandate that requires the agency to pay $5.5 billion a year into its fund for future employee health benefits, and end Saturday mail delivery. Mr. Donahoe said the changes would allow the agency to save $20 billion by 2016.Ending Saturday mail delivery would save the Postal Service about $2 billion annually, according to its estimates. The agency lost $15.9 billion in the last fiscal year and $1.3 billion in the first quarter of the current one.But despite the outcry from some lawmakers after the announcement last week that the Postal Service would seek to end Saturday letter delivery, few senators questioned Mr. Donahoe on Wednesday about the agency’s proposal. Most of the questions came from rural lawmakers like Senator Jon Tester, Democrat of Montana, who said he was worried about the impact on rural communities of some other Postal Service changes, like the closing of mail-processing plants.But Senators Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Carl Levin of Michigan, both Democrats, did question whether the agency had the legal authority to make the Saturday change. And both senators said they were not satisfied with the legal justification given by Mr. Donahoe, who said that the agency could end Saturday delivery without Congressional approval.Several postal union representatives who testified also questioned the legal authority for the Postal Service to end six-day letter delivery, calling it an act of desperation.“We can ill afford to eliminate Saturday delivery, which remains a critical strength and competitive strong point for the U.S.P.S,” said Jeanette Dwyer, the president of the National Rural Letter Carriers Association.The Postal Service said that since 2006, it had reduced the size of its work force by 193,000 workers, consolidated more than 200 mail-processing centers and reduced hours at 13,000 post offices. But agency officials said cuts and rate increases were not enough.“To preserve our mission to provide secure, reliable and affordable universal delivery service — and do so without burdening the American taxpayer — the Postal Service needs urgent reform to its business model,” Mr. Donahoe said in his testimony.Lawmakers did not say when they would begin work on postal legislation. The Senate passed a bill last year to overhaul the Postal Service, but a House bill never made it out of committee."
