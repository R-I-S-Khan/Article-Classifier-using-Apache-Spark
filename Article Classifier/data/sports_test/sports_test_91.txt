NEW ORLEANS Neither quarterback Super Bowl XLVII win Mr Universe competition Baltimore Joe Flacco boasts muscle tone insurance salesman San Francisco Colin Kaepernick looks like surfer Both tall gangly somewhat awkward built like cyclists football players Yet quarterbacks also possess two strongest arms N F L two million dollar limbs draw hyperbolic comparisons cannons shotguns catapults basically anything shoots objects really far really fast The matchup two physically unimposing players also physically gifted underscores important matters regard throwing mechanics term arm strength The latter something misnomer arm strength little size quarterback biceps actual strength arm The former involves entire body starts arm feet Case point Flacco Case point Part 2 Kaepernick Look someone like John Elway like Brett Favre said Jim Miller retired quarterback analyst SiriusXM NFL Radio They could physically players could Both Colin Joe Flacco like Growing Kaepernick played baseball Naturally pitched His fastball reached 94 miles per hour threw two hitters high school The Chicago Cubs drafted despite greater interest football seemed misguided way back Kaepernick received one offer N C A A Division I football scholarship Nevada He blew away Wolf Pack coaches one regard arm strength That one thing stood said Chris Ault college coach He gun His passes actually whistled Kaepernick throwing motion though left much desired He delivered passes sidearm without arc Early career Kaepernick threw often rolling right could easily launch ball deep back across field One darts left imprint laces receiver Another hit tight end face mask 50 yards away The 49ers tell similar stories arm come fear practice revere games Receiver Michael Crabtree said players would rotate back line passing drills avoid Kaepernick turn throw Tight end Vernon Davis described Kaepernick freak adding He take fingers watch Davis also said sometimes needed chase Kaepernick weight room Flacco arm strength less obvious less potent He also played baseball He fired 40 yard route Miami traveled six feet ground toward receiver near sideline according Gil Brandt longtime N F L personnel evaluator SiriusXM analyst Flacco 70 yard touchdown pass receiver Jacoby Jones postseason traveled beyond Denver secondary believed Flacco could heave Safety Rahim Moore fell ball sailed head Despite Flacco Kaepernick ability throw far fast however Brandt others argued arm strength garnered much attention When Brandt worked Cowboys used radar gun potential prospects One player whose name could recall registered throws 60 p h Phil Simms clocked 49 Guess turned Brandt interested quarterbacks threw accurate passes strong work ethics linger mistakes He ranked arm strength eighth ninth fundamental attribute quarterback For every rifle armed Elway Joe Montana king soft touch Brandt said Rudy Bukich hardest thrower ever saw Bukich played 14 seasons 1950s 60s threw interceptions touchdowns Arm strength important often led believe Brandt said It helps though Just ask Warren Moon He ranked arm strength accuracy ability make every throw third among important attributes He could zing passes accurately 50 yards This helped carry Pro Football Hall Fame Moon knew arm strength came throwing motion figurative guns That read books Nolan Ryan Orel Hershiser studied Roger Clemens training methods The throwing motion Moon said like concert many disparate parts harmony Dr Glenn Fleisig research director American Sports Medicine Institute biomechanics research laboratory studied analyzed matters mostly regard pitchers also quarterbacks In one study Fleisig team looked throwing motions determine whether helpful high school college athletes pitch play quarterback time They also studied Texas Rangers pitchers threw footballs warm The researchers found throwing motions largely similar Quarterbacks held ball closer heads stood upright took shorter strides The researchers studied called optimal football mechanics throws made drop backs balance run They found pitchers quarterbacks planted feet rotated hips upper trunks flipped shoulders forward creating whiplike motion It full body arm Fleisig said It kinetic chain series coordinated events The arm actually last part chain Fleisig team found throwing football less stressful throwing baseball less harmful arm Still research support idea athletes would benefit throwing baseballs footballs season It however reinforce notion quarterback ability throw far fast defined arm power arm strength Strength refers force Power force multiplied velocity This high school physics translated N F L Quarterbacks need power different strength Fleisig said In business see thousands throwing athletes without shirts They look like muscleheads They strength necessarily But power If arm power important trait quarterback still factors greatly teams design offenses A stronger armed passer allows coordinators options use field The passer throws faster flatter often harder haul This evident modern N F L features downfield passing short passes West Coast offense precision timing ruled Last season three quarterbacks threw 5 000 yards None 1990 2000 Five quarterbacks tossed 30 touchdown passes last season In 1990 number two 2000 three Baltimore particular indicative trend The Ravens like run run run let Flacco strike deep He might attempt six times game eight four But potential pass interference call Moon noted far higher day payoff long complete pass attempts carry great reward A weaker armed quarterback limited So quarterback offense As receivers become taller stronger faster athletes play quarterback fewer teams run ball often rules change favor offense ability throw deep Moon said becomes even important Perhaps country see Super Bowl Flacco Kaepernick two skinny unimposing men launch passes high arcs whiz bullets defenders Strong arms two Not arm strength
