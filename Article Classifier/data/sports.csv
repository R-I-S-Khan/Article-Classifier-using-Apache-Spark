https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/14/sports/nfl-picks-predictions-week-15.html,"There are only two N.F.L. games in Week 15 between teams that The Upshot’s Playoff Simulator gives a 50 percent chance or greater of making the playoffs, but there are three crucial matchups. The Chiefs and the Chargers will meet in a game that could decide the A.F.C. West, the Rams and the Seahawks will battle for the N.F.C. West, and a Sunday afternoon matchup between the Steelers and the Patriots could clinch home-field advantage throughout the playoffs for Pittsburgh (with some help from Houston). Here are our picks against the spread.Last week’s record against the spread: 11-5Overall record: 107-95-6Patriots at Steelers, 4:25 p.m., CBSLine: Patriots by 3Jerry Rice never won a Most Valuable Player Award. Neither did Randy Moss, Calvin Johnson, Cris Carter or Steve Largent. No wide receiver has ever been picked as the N.F.L.’s best player, an award that has gone to 41 quarterbacks, 18 running backs, one defensive tackle, one linebacker and even a kicker: Mark Moseley of the Redskins, in the strike-shortened 1982 season. But receivers may finally get their due with Antonio Brown of the Steelers (11-2, clinched A.F.C. North).Brown leads the N.F.L. in receptions and receiving yards, and has been the catalyst for a Pittsburgh team that has surged to the top of the standings in the A.F.C. He has been especially good in his last four games, with 39 catches for 627 yards and six touchdowns. If he keeps up his pace he will finish the season with 1,857 receiving yards, which would fall short of Johnson’s record of 1,964 but be the third most receiving yards recorded in a single season.Benefiting Brown to be the first receiver to win an M.V.P. Award is the lack of an obvious choice at other positions. Among quarterbacks, the Eagles’ Carson Wentz was a favorite until he was lost for the season last Sunday. The Seahawks’ Russell Wilson should be considered. The Patriots’ Tom Brady is always in the mix, and the Saints’ Drew Brees may get some attention (even if his team’s resurgence can largely be credited to its dynamic running game). But some of Brown’s peers have been in awe of him.Helping matters considerably would be a win over the Patriots (10-3), who have a greater than 99 percent chance of making the playoffs, according to the Playoff Simulator. Beating New England would give the Steelers a first-round bye. Should that happen, in combination with Jacksonville losing to or tying Houston, the Steelers would clinch home field advantage throughout the playoffs.Pittsburgh is still hobbled by the loss of linebacker Ryan Shazier to spinal surgery, but the Steelers proved last week that they could succeed without him, thanks to Brown and the offense, which has struggled against lesser team but seems to do well against tough competition. Pick: SteelersRams at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., FoxLine: Seahawks by 2For most of the season, the N.F.C. West has been dominated by the Rams (9-4, 83 percent playoff chance). Quarterback Jared Goff’s rapid maturation and a great season by running back Todd Gurley have made their offense something to fear. That has helped the defense find consistency, since it is spending less time on the field.For the Seahawks (8-5, 55 percent), the ride has not been as easy. Among other problems, they lost Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor to season-ending injuries and struggled to develop a consistent running game. Their record was helped by a favorable schedule, but also by Russell Wilson’s penchant for keeping them in games they had no business being in.Seattle’s troubles may be forgiven if it beats Los Angeles at home, which would move it into a tie for the division lead. Neither team has an advantage in terms of Week 16 and 17 opponents, so a win would give Seattle about a 50-50 shot at a division title.That said, the Rams have Robert Woods, the team’s best wide receiver, back, and if Jared Goff can deal with the crowd noise at CenturyLink Field, he should carve up Seattle’s injury-depleted secondary with passes to Woods, Sammy Watkins and the rookie standout Cooper Kupp. Pick: RamsChargers at Chiefs, 8:25 p.m. (Saturday), NFL NetworkLine: Chargers by 1After four games, the Chiefs (7-6, 40 percent) had a four-game lead over the Chargers (7-6, 69 percent). Their seasons have gone in different directions since then, and San Diego is the road favorite with a chance to steal the A.F.C. West. Because it’s on a Saturday night, this game might receive less attention than it deserves, but the Chargers are coming in with a four-game winning streak, and the winner should be the favorite to win the division, based on coming opponents. Pick: ChargersBengals at Vikings, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Vikings by 10.5There are few coaches as familiar with each other as Marvin Lewis of the Bengals (5-8, <1 percent) and Mike Zimmer of the Vikings (10-3, >99 percent). Zimmer was previously Lewis’s defensive coordinator, and they have known each other since the 1980s. In their first game against each other as head coaches, Zimmer is at an almost comical advantage. A loss last week put Minnesota behind Philadelphia for the top spot in the N.F.C., but a manageable schedule and Carson Wentz’s injury could open the door for the Vikings to get back to that or, at the very least, get a first-round bye. The Vikings have enough players on the injury report to make a double-digit spread too high to pick them, but they should win. Pick: BengalsPackers at Panthers, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Panthers by 3Aaron Rodgers, sidelined since he broke his collarbone in Week 6, is being thrown right into the deep end, with the Packers (7-6, 9 percent) clinging to a tiny chance of making the playoffs. In a similar situation last season, when the Packers essentially needed to win out, Rodgers delivered, and his history suggests no one should bet against him. A game on the road against the Panthers (9-4, 79 percent) is one Green Bay should lose, but in Rodgers’s career, it is the type of game he tends to win, and in the most exciting way. Pick: PackersEagles at Giants, 1 p.m., FoxPick: Eagles by 7.5The Eagles (11-2, clinched N.F.C. East) were Super Bowl favorites, but with Carson Wentz out for the season it is hard to know what to make of them. Nick Foles is one of the better backups in the N.F.L., but until he has been truly tested in Philadelphia’s offense, it is an open question as to whether the Eagles are still among the N.F.C.’s best.Coach Steve Spagnuolo of the Giants (2-11, eliminated) said that Foles was a good enough passer to hold his own, but that people might be focusing too much on the passing game of a team that has LeGarrette Blount, Jay Ajayi and Corey Clement at running back.“I don’t think it’s going to change all that much for us because you’ve got to stop that run game,” Spagnuolo told reporters. “It really didn’t matter who was handing it off.” Pick: EaglesJets at Saints, 1 p.m., CBSPick: Saints by 15The Saints (9-4, 91 percent) lost last week, and have dropped two of their last three, but it is probably not yet time to worry. A 3-point loss can be chalked up to playing on the road and to a concussion forcing Alvin Kamara out of the game, but now they will be home, Kamara has returned and they have a soft opponent in the Jets (5-8, <1 percent).The Jets were fairly entertaining in recent weeks, with Josh McCown airing it out and being rewarded for his aggressiveness, but he is out for the remainder of the season with a broken hand, and the team is left with a choice of Bryce Petty or Christian Hackenberg. Regardless of which Jets quarterback receives more playing time, the Saints should win, even if the point spread is too large to pick them. Pick: JetsCowboys at Raiders, 8:30 p.m., NBCPick: Cowboys by 3No one would mistake the defense of the Raiders (6-7, 5 percent) for that of the Jaguars or Vikings, but it represents more of a challenge than the Cowboys (7-6, 6 percent) have faced in either of the last two weeks. Dallas scored 68 points in those games, which indicates the offense has adjusted to life without Ezekiel Elliott, but it is not clear how much that was helped by inferior competition.Helping matters for Dallas is Sean Lee, the team’s standout linebacker, who recently returned from an injury. If Demarcus Lawrence can put consistent pressure on Derek Carr, and Lee can take care of the middle of the field, the Cowboys’ improving secondary should shut down Oakland’s vertical threats. Pick: CowboysTexans at Jaguars, 1 p.m., FoxPick: Jaguars by 10.5The Jaguars (9-4, >99 percent) have clinched the franchise’s first winning season since 2007, and can clinch a playoff berth with a win this week (they could clinch even if they lose or tie should they get help from various teams). There is no reason their success should stop any time soon: They will face teams with a combined record of 15-24 in the final weeks. First up are the Texans (4-9, <1 percent), who do not present much of a challenge. Justifying an enormous point spread with a volatile offense led by Blake Bortles and Leonard Fournette is difficult, but the Jaguars’ defense is just that good. Pick: JaguarsTitans at 49ers, 4:25 p.m., CBSPick: 49ers by 2If you had told fans of the 49ers (3-10, eliminated) a few weeks ago that the team would be favored at home against the potentially playoff-bound Titans (8-5, 83 percent), there would have been some good laughs had. But that is the effect Jimmy Garoppolo has had on San Francisco since he took over as starting quarterback. He is 2-0 since a trade freed him from his apprenticeship in New England, but it may be premature to expect the 49ers, who have 10 wins over the last three seasons, to be favorites against a team that has eight this year. Pick: TitansRavens at Browns, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Ravens by 7Beyond the career revival of Josh Gordon — which could end at any time given the troubled wide receiver’s past — there is not much reason to watch the Browns (0-13, eliminated). In the last two seasons, they have gone a combined 1-28, and they have not even been making things competitive, with just a 3-10 record in terms of beating the point spread as the underdog. The Ravens (7-6, 69 percent) are battling it out with several other teams for the A.F.C.’s second wild-card spot, and the energy involved in that alone should be enough to get them past Cleveland. Pick: RavensDolphins at Bills, 1 p.m., CBSLine: N/ATyrod Taylor appears ready to return from a knee injury, and that is great news for the Bills (7-6, 25 percent) because Taylor’s backup, Nathan Peterman, was in the league’s concussion protocol during the week. The Bills seemingly need to win at least two of their three remaining games to have a chance at beating out Baltimore and the various other teams in the mix for a wild-card spot, and since one of the three games is against New England, Buffalo’s best bet would be to win both games it has left against the Dolphins (6-7, 11 percent). Pick: BillsCardinals at Redskins, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Redskins by 4Coach Bruce Arians of the Cardinals (6-7, <1 percent) raised a few eyebrows during the week when he compared Blaine Gabbert’s intelligence on the field to Peyton Manning and Andrew Luck’s. Arians, who coached both of those quarterbacks, said: “Yeah, he’s up there. To play at this level in seven offenses is not easy, and he’s had success, especially in this offense. But yeah, he’s up there with those guys mentally.”Gabbert, 28, has an 11-33 career record as a starter in seven seasons, and a passer rating of 72.4. Manning had 11 or more wins in a season 11 times.The Redskins (5-8, eliminated) have a worse record than Arizona, but despite Gabbert’s intelligence, they should be favored at home. Pick: RedskinsBears at Lions, 4:30 p.m. (Saturday), NFL NetworkLine: Lions by 5.5The Lions (7-6, 16 percent) ended a two-game losing streak with a win over lowly Tampa Bay, but it was likely too little too late, as Detroit’s playoff hopes had all but vanished. There is some N.F.C. North pride at stake against the Bears (4-9, eliminated), but considering this is an afternoon game on a Saturday, they could just not play it and insist that they did. Pick: LionsBroncos at Colts, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), NBC and NFL NetworkLine: Broncos by 2.5Somehow, the only game in Week 15 between two eliminated teams is one of the four that will be played in prime time. It is not like “Thursday Night Football” is known for its quality games, but when the fan bases of both the Broncos (4-9) and the Colts (3-10) would most likely prefer a loss to improve their draft position, it does not make for a compelling game. Here’s something to watch: Frank Gore is 59 yards short of his 12th consecutive season with 1,000 or more yards from scrimmage. (Emmitt Smith holds the record with 13.) Getting those 59 yards against Denver’s defense may be difficult. Pick: BroncosFalcons at Buccaneers, 8:30 p.m., ESPNLine: Falcons by 6.5The Falcons (8-5, 61 percent) can capture the N.F.C. South division title if they win their three remaining games, but they could easily fall into the trap of looking beyond this game against the Buccaneers (4-9, eliminated) to crucial matchups in Weeks 16 and 17 against New Orleans and Carolina. There is no doubt that Atlanta should be favored to win, especially considering Julio Jones’s tremendous game against them in Week 12, but a spread of 6.5 points on the road is fairly aggressive, and a good effort by Tampa Bay could keep things closer than that. Pick: Buccaneers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/22/sports/patriots-eagles-super-bowl.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Moments after the New England Patriots grabbed the late fourth quarter lead in the A.F.C. Championship game on Sunday, a portable podium, like an apparition, suddenly emerged from the shadows of a tunnel beyond one of the end zones.Five minutes earlier, when the Patriots were still behind and it felt like their dynasty was collapsing on itself, the podium was not visible. But then, Tom Brady’s poised passing led to yet another playoff comeback as the Patriots methodically squashed the Jacksonville Jaguars’ dreams of an upset.And like magic, the podium, resembling a parade float, was wheeled into position on the field at Gillette Stadium for the Patriots to celebrate their eighth conference championship since 2001, the third in the last four years.As the confetti fell here Sunday evening, the stage seemed like a metaphor for the coming Super Bowl.Two teams will play in it on Feb. 4, but why does it feel like the Patriots own the stage and they are bringing it with them?The Philadelphia Eagles, who routed the Minnesota Vikings by 38-7 to win the N.F.C. championship, certainly are a worthy, powerful opponent. Until their stellar quarterback Carson Wentz was injured late in the season, they would have probably been predicted to win the Super Bowl no matter whom they were playing.It helps give the Eagles an irresistible story line. They are, for example, the anti-Patriots in so many ways. Their back-up quarterback, Nick Foles, is not a nationally known figure, a castoff who began the year firmly planted on the bench.While Patriots fans are haughtily delirious with success, Philadelphia fans are shamed by decades of harrowing letdowns.The Brady-led Patriots often have benefited from quirks of good fortune in the postseason. The Eagles, who have been to two Super Bowls but never won, are usually doomed by ill-timed bounces, unlucky injuries and other bad breaks — not only in the playoffs but whenever they get near the playoffs.They lost their last Super Bowl appearance to the Patriots, 24-21, in 2005.So in that context, the browbeaten Eagles may be a fan favorite, and not just because of the virulent backlash against the Patriots outside of New England (see Deflategate).But can they win?The Eagles pass rush, so evident Sunday, is the perfect nuisance to get under Brady’s skin. Philadelphia’s defense forces turnovers, which is another key to defeating New England. The Eagles also have plenty of moxie, which they displayed with their goal line stand Sunday when the Vikings were trying to claw back into the game in the third quarter.On offense, Foles looked newly confident and self-reliant, never more so than during the Eagles’ opening drive of the second half when he tossed an extraordinary touchdown pass on a flea-flicker.First, Foles caught a wayward, slow lateral on the play, then he avoided the pressure in a disintegrating pocket and finally stepped up and emphatically threw the football through a narrow window in the Vikings defense to wide receiver Torrey Smith for a 41-yard touchdown. It was the dagger that all but finished off Minnesota (the defensive goal line stand was truly the final blow).Afterward, Foles exulted in a way that spoke for the essence of Eagles fandom.“Everyone was against us,” he said. “We weren’t anyone’s pick in this game. But you know what, we stuck together and just jumped on them.”So watching these Eagles negotiate the Super Bowl landscape in the next two weeks is going to be entertaining. Cue the “Rocky” theme.But at the same time, there will be an overriding narrative in the run-up to the game and it will be the Patriots’ ongoing campaign to rewrite the history of pro football.This would be their sixth Super Bowl victory, which would not only tie the Patriots with the Pittsburgh Steelers for the most ever, it might cement the team as the best, or at least one of the best, of any N.F.L. era.Since the Patriots championships are occurring in an age of free agency and the N.F.L. salary cap, which are two factors that would likely have broken up dynastic teams like Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers, the 1950s Yankees and the 1960s Boston Celtics, another Patriots Super Bowl victory raises the question: Where does their current run rank among the great championship streaks of any team in any sport?All their wins have come since 2001, and so another victory would give them more championships than any franchise in any major American sport in the same period.The most titles by any N.B.A. team since 2001 is four, by the Los Angeles Lakers and the San Antonio Spurs. In Major League Baseball, the Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants have won three World Series each.On Sunday, the Patriots came back to win despite having lost one of their best players, the tight end Rob Gronkowski, to a head injury. Their defensive unit’s lack of speed on the corners of the field was being exploited by the Jaguars fleet-footed running backs. Brady had an injured hand. For a long time Sunday, things did not look good for the home team.And still they won. It’s what they do.“It’s just been an unbelievable run,” Brady said Sunday evening. “It’s a different team every year and the results have been pretty consistent. It’s pretty amazing. It’d be really great if we take care of business in a couple weeks.”And so another Super Bowl, another Patriots appearance.They are a team not only made for the big stage, they always seem to know where to find it."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/26/sports/football/nfl-predictions-schedule.html,"Many N.F.L. teams will reach the halfway mark this week in games played, and the list of elite teams has narrowed. Teams like the Detroit Lions and the Houston Texans are looking to prove they deserve to be on that list despite records that suggest otherwise, while teams with inflated records, like the Miami Dolphins and the Minnesota Vikings, will try to keep their good luck going for another week. Here are our picks against the spread:Last week’s record against the spread: 11-3-1Overall record: 50-55-1Follow our live coverage of N.F.L. scores, updates and analysis here.Steelers at Lions, 8:30 p.m., NBCLine: Steelers by 3The Steelers (5-2) have had remarkable stability in team leadership. Coach Mike Tomlin has been on the sideline for the last 11 seasons, and the team’s offensive superstars (Ben Roethlisberger, Le’Veon Bell and Antonio Brown) have been together for the last five. So, it’s especially odd for Pittsburgh to have had so much off-field drama.Bell demanded a huge new contract, Brown was critical of Roethlisberger’s production, and the team melted down about Alejandro Villanueva’s response to the national anthem controversy. The latest turbulence involves wide receiver Martavis Bryant, Pittsburgh’s deep threat, who complained his way out of the lineup.Amid all that hullabaloo, Pittsburgh has played stellar defense. In the last few weeks, it has started to pull out of its offensive funk, even while struggling with scoring in the red zone. Roethlisberger has been involving Bell and Brown more, and the team has gotten a boost from JuJu Smith-Schuster, a rookie wide receiver who is the youngest player in the N.F.L. this season. His role could expand this week with Bryant inactive, provided he clears the N.F.L.’s concussion protocol, which he is expected to do after practicing on Wednesday.The Lions (3-3), though, are a dangerous opponent at home. Two of their losses have been of the hard-luck variety, and last week’s double-digit loss to New Orleans included a hectic rally that fell apart when Matthew Stafford threw a pair of interceptions late in the fourth quarter, one of which was returned for a touchdown.Detroit’s defense is not nearly as crisp as Pittsburgh’s, but it can be just as opportunistic. If Roethlisberger is at all careless with his passes, Detroit will make him pay for it. Golden Tate’s being limited, or possibly inactive, with a sprained AC joint takes some jolt out of the Lions’ offense, but this should be a close game. Pick: Steelers49ers at Eagles, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Eagles by 13The 49ers (0-7) are very bad. The Eagles (6-1) are very good. It is not hard to predict that Philadelphia will take care of business at home against a winless opponent, but a spread of 13 points is demanding a blowout, and San Francisco’s plucky young defense may be up to the task of preventing that from happening. As good as the Eagles have been, they have kept things close in four of their six wins, and they have little reason to try to run up the score against an overmatched opponent. Pick: 49ersTexans at Seahawks, 4:05 p.m., CBSLine: Seahawks by 5.5Thanks to the emergence of Deshaun Watson, the Texans (3-3) have averaged 39.3 points a game over the last four weeks. The hype has been deafening, but in reality, he has yet to face a very challenging defense. That ends this week, as the Seahawks (4-2) are the type of team that has the combination of talent and veteran know-how to truly mess with a rookie quarterback’s mind. A victory might be too much to ask for, but Watson is talented enough to keep things close, making a 5.5-point spread a bit too generous. Pick: TexansCowboys at Redskins, 4:25 p.m., FoxLine: Cowboys by 2This game could be Ezekiel Elliott’s last one for quite some time, as he has a court hearing on Monday that could determine the fate of his six-game suspension. Elliott seemed to be buckling under the weight of the looming punishment at the start of the season, but he has looked like his old self in the last two weeks, and it is no coincidence that the Cowboys (3-3) have righted the ship along the way. At a glance, the Redskins (3-3) seem to have a good run defense, but they have allowed so few yards because teams have chosen not to run against them, which won’t be the case with Dallas in town. Pick: CowboysBears at Saints, 1 p.m. FoxLine: Saints by 9Relying on your team’s defense to do all the scoring is not a sustainable strategy in the N.F.L., but that is what has been working for the Bears (3-4) in the Mitchell Trubisky era. The rookie quarterback has done almost nothing notable, averaging 116 passing yards per game, but has a 2-1 record despite having thrown just two touchdown passes in a three-game stretch in which his team’s defense scored three. The Saints (4-2) are a tough team to play defense against, especially at home, but if Chicago’s surge on that side of the ball has not been a mirage, it should be able to beat a 9-point spread. Pick: BearsRaiders at Bills, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Bills by 2.5There is nothing like crushing a well-regarded division rival to lift the spirits of a flailing team, and the Raiders (3-4) did just that with a come-from-behind win against Kansas City. Derek Carr returned to his 2016 form just in time to lead a game-winning drive. Unfortunately for Carr, the Bills (4-2) have a habit of making opponents miserable, and they can likely gut out an ugly win. With Marshawn Lynch suspended, Oakland will have a hard time controlling the clock. Pick: BillsChargers at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Patriots by 7This game will serve as an indication of whether the Patriots (5-2) fixed their problems in the secondary last week, or if Atlanta simply was not good enough to take advantage of New England’s biggest weakness. Philip Rivers does not have the same confidence problems that the Falcons have been dealing with, so he will probably challenge New England early and often. If this game were in Los Angeles, the Chargers (3-4) would stand a better chance, but the Patriots are incredibly tough to beat at home. Pick: PatriotsPanthers at Buccaneers, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Buccaneers by 2.5Cam Newton has had two brutal games in a row. He has completed just 57 percent of his passes, and his five interceptions matched his total from the first five games combined. But watching the Panthers (4-3), it is easy to feel sorry for Newton as he is brutalized on play after play. Even the successful plays — many of which have come with Newton running rather than passing — end with big hits. The big quarterback rarely has extended stretches of ineffectiveness, and an important division game against the equally-struggling Buccaneers (2-4) should bring out the best in him. Pick: PanthersDolphins at Ravens, 8:25 p.m. (Thursday), CBS and NFL NetworkLine: Ravens by 3Cameron Wake, a defensive end for the Dolphins (4-2), managed to sum up “Thursday Night Football” in one convenient quotation. He told reporters this week: “To be very honest, nobody is going to be ready the way they like to be. They’ll be as ready as you can be on Thursday night.”With Matt Moore expected to start for the injured Jay Cutler, Miami’s offense will run through the team’s running back, Jay Ajayi, and that spells trouble for the Ravens (3-4), as they are ranked last in rushing yards allowed per game. Pick: DolphinsVikings vs. Browns at London, 9:30 a.m., NFL NetworkLine: Vikings by 9.5The Browns (0-7) will play their first game without tackle Joe Thomas since 2006, so Spencer Drango, a second-year player out of Baylor, will be protecting DeShone Kizer’s blind side against a Minnesota defense that is tied for sixth in sacks, with 21. It is understandable for the Vikings (5-2) to be “road” favorites in the neutral site of London’s Twickenham Stadium, but a spread of nearly 10 points is a lot to ask for from an underwhelming Minnesota offense. Pick: BrownsFalcons at Jets, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Falcons by 5The Jets (3-4) followed a three-game winning streak with consecutive losses, but they played well in both games and lost them by a combined 10 points. They go into every game with a talent deficit, but Coach Todd Bowles has had them focused and prepared each week. There is no reason the Falcons (3-3) shouldn’t mop the floor with them based on personnel, but the same thing was true in their recent losses to Miami and Buffalo. Unless the team has figured out what has been holding its offense back, this game could be close. Pick: JetsColts at Bengals, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Bengals by 10.5Jacoby Brissett endured a beating last week that few other quarterbacks have. He was sacked or hit on 31 of his team’s 67 plays, and the Colts (2-5) spent the week arguing about whether it was appropriate for T. Y. Hilton, a wide receiver, to blame his team’s offensive line for the blowout loss. The Bengals (2-4) do not have the players to replicate Jacksonville’s savagery, but they will try. A point spread of 10.5 points is enormous, but the Colts have lost by more than that in three of the last five weeks, with the other two games being wins against the two worst teams in the N.F.L. Pick: BengalsBroncos at Chiefs, 8:30 p.m., ESPNLine: Chiefs by 7The Broncos (3-3) scored 42 points in Week 2, and in the four games since, they have also scored 42 points — combined. The Chiefs (5-2) are a division rival that not only has more talent than Denver, and home-field advantage, but also the motivation of having lost two close games in a row after a 5-0 start. Denver’s defense can probably limit Alex Smith and the Chiefs to a few touchdowns and a bunch of field goals, but that should be plenty to outscore Trevor Siemian and the Denver offense. Pick: Chiefs."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/17/sports/antonio-brown-steelers-patriots.html,"The Pittsburgh Steelers started off Sunday with a huge morale boost from an appearance by Ryan Shazier, the linebacker who sustained a frightening back injury two weeks ago. Then the team took a nearly proportional blow when Antonio Brown was knocked out of the game with a calf injury.But the true emotional ringer came in the final minute of the game at Heinz Field, when a controversially overturned touchdown catch and an interception resulted in a gutting Pittsburgh loss to the New England Patriots, 27-24.The reversal of fortune, which came after what was initially ruled a 10-yard touchdown pass from Ben Roethlisberger to Jesse James with 34 seconds left, prevented the Steelers from clinching a first-round bye in the playoffs and opened up the race for home-field advantage, with the Steelers (11-3), the Patriots (11-3) and the Jacksonville Jaguars (10-4) still in contention. New England clinched the A.F.C. East title with the victory.Despite the loss of Brown early in the second quarter to a serious calf injury, the Steelers led until the final minutes of the fourth. But with just over two minutes remaining, the Patriots reeled off a 77-yard drive in just 70 seconds, scoring a go-ahead touchdown on an 8-yard run by Dion Lewis with 56 seconds left. A 2-point conversion pass from Tom Brady to Rob Gronkowski made it a 3-point game.The Steelers faced long odds as they started a drive from their own 21-yard line, but they came back to life on a wild catch-and-run by JuJu Smith-Schuster, a rookie wide receiver, who got the ball on a crossing route and broke free of the coverage on the sideline. In a play that seemed like something out of a video game, Smith-Schuster streaked all over the field, shedding numerous defenders along the way, and was finally brought down after a 69-yard gain.On the next play, Roethlisberger found James for the apparent touchdown catch, but after a review it was determined that James did not “survive” his contact with the ground, and the call was overturned. Two plays later, Duron Harmon intercepted a tipped pass from Roethlisberger, sealing the game.Asked why James was ruled to not make the catch despite having controlled the ball without being touched on his way into the end zone, Tony Corrente, the game’s referee, said a lack of contact was irrelevant.”As he hit the ground, the ball began to roll and rotate and the ball hit the ground,” Corrente said, “that’s the end at that point.”At his postgame news conference, Coach Mike Tomlin of the Steelers said he could not see the disputed play well enough to know how he felt about the call, though he was resigned to the outcome.“It’s really irrelevant how I feel about it,” Tomlin said. “It’s not going to change the outcome of the game. I’m not going to cry over spilled milk.”Pittsburgh came into the game on an eight-game winning streak, but the team now faces a stiff fight for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs over the next couple of weeks, potentially without the help of Brown.The team had yet to update Brown’s status Sunday evening, beyond saying he was taken to a hospital for further evaluation of a calf injury, but he did not appear capable of putting any weight on his left leg as he was helped off the field. An extended absence by Brown, the N.F.L.’s leader in both receptions and receiving yards, would be a huge blow to Pittsburgh’s Super Bowl aspirations. In recent weeks, Brown had been mentioned as a potential candidate for the N.F.L.’s Most Valuable Player Award, and on the first of his two catches on Sunday, he secured his fifth consecutive season with 100 or more receptions.The Patriots got back to the top of the A.F.C. standings thanks to Brady’s impressive final drive. He completed 22 of 35 passes for 298 yards, one touchdown and one interception for the day, and was at his best on that final drive, repeatedly finding Gronkowski for huge gains before letting Lewis take the ball in for the score.Pittsburgh has two fairly easy matchups remaining on its schedule, playing at the Houston Texans next week before closing out the season with a home game against the currently winless Cleveland Browns. The Patriots have home games against the Buffalo Bills and the Jets, while the Jaguars have the toughest schedule of the three, with road games against the San Francisco 49ers and the Tennessee Titans."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/13/sports/football/nfl-playoffs-new-england-patriots.html,"The trade deadline passed a few weeks ago, but perhaps just this once the N.F.L. can make a teensy-weensy exception. A modest proposal: The A.F.C., saturated by mediocrity (or worse), sends its two wild-card berths to the N.F.C., loaded with contenders, for future considerations.A chasm has existed between the A.F.C.’s top teams and the next tier for some time. For proof, examine New England’s annual postseason stroll to the conference championship game.That gap feels as pronounced as ever, with the Patriots (7-2), flawed yet barreling toward an eighth consecutive first-round bye, facing a threat from perhaps only two teams: Kansas City (6-3), which has lost three of its last four, and Pittsburgh (7-2), which needed a field goal as time expired to beat woeful Indianapolis on Sunday. The field was further diminished when Houston’s exciting rookie quarterback, Deshaun Watson, sustained a season-ending knee injury.On a weekend in which another division leader, Tennessee, also needed a late comeback to defeat an allegedly inferior opponent in Cincinnati, and Jacksonville, currently in the first wild-card slot, was gifted a victory by the Los Angeles Chargers, the worst performance by a team that entered Week 10 holding a playoff spot was submitted by the group with the longest drought in the league.Buffalo specializes in rowdy pregame tailgates and second-half fades, and both were in full view as the Bills suffered a 47-10 humiliation against the New Orleans Saints, who, running for 298 yards, treated their hosts like the folding tables that Bills fans adore leaping onto. The loss embarrassed the Bills, who had never allowed six rushing touchdowns, but it had little bearing on their playoff standing. Yup, still the No. 6 seed.The N.F.L. likes to brag about the competitiveness across the league, how in every year since 2000 at least one team with a winning percentage of .500 or lower midway through its season has gone on to make the playoffs.Seeing that the top 10 in the N.F.C. have winning records, if the streak continues this season it will likely be because of an A.F.C. team: Oakland (4-5), Baltimore (4-5) and Miami (4-5), which was routed at Carolina on Monday night, remain very much alive.In the event the N.F.L. decides to keep the current playoff format (sigh), six teams will nonetheless qualify from the A.F.C. Barring a collapse, New England, Pittsburgh and Kansas City are well positioned. As for the other three?Here’s a look at the leading candidates:JACKSONVILLE JAGUARS (6-3): By no means was Louis Riddick comparing Jacksonville’s quarterback, Blake Bortles, to Peyton Manning. But, he said, the Jaguars’ formula for success this season — run a lot, throw a little, lean on a ferocious defense — resembles that of the Denver Broncos during their Super Bowl season two years ago.“Right now they’re more than right to take the ball out of his hands as much as possible,” Riddick, an ESPN analyst, said of Bortles in an interview last week.Bortles’s fourth quarter against the Chargers — 7 of 20 passing with two dreadful interceptions — corroborated the wisdom of that strategy. But in spite of those interceptions, the Jaguars still won, and they won because of a stingy defense that could propel them to their first playoff berth since the 2007 season. They forced a fumble and a three-and-out immediately after those interceptions and then set up the winning field goal with an A.J. Bouye interception in overtime.“All I know, we are the best two corners in the league,” cornerback Jalen Ramsey told reporters afterward. “What do you all expect?”BALTIMORE RAVENS (4-5): If the Ravens’ defense (18 takeaways) and special teams played every snap, they might win the division. Alas, they do still have to line up under center. Baltimore must hope that quarterback Joe Flacco can summon his late-season wizardry of years past to resuscitate an offense that has averaged 4.4 yards per play, tied for worst in the N.F.L. Any boost could help the Ravens capitalize on a favorable schedule, which concludes with a trip to winless Cleveland and home games against Indianapolis and Cincinnati.TENNESSEE TITANS (6-3): Despite scoring fewer total points than their opponents (205 to 213), the Titans are 6-3. With a few exceptions — Miami (-17) and Houston (-49) last season, Indianapolis (-30) in 2012 — teams with negative point differentials do not make the playoffs because teams with negative point differentials do not usually win a lot.“It’s tough to have faith in the Titans,” said the former receiver Nate Burleson, now an analyst for NFL Network, in an interview last week. “They’ll give you one thing one week, like this is a great product and they’ve got weapons, and another week they just look like a shell of themselves.”What bodes well for Tennessee, at least on offense, is the improved health of two crucial players: Marcus Mariota, who has seemed to regain his mobility after a hamstring injury, and the rookie receiver Corey Davis, who was targeted 10 times Sunday in his second game back after missing five with a strained hamstring.BUFFALO BILLS (5-4): Buffalo’s promising start has been erased by two debacles — Jets/Saints 81, Bills 31 — and unless they fix their rampant defensive issues, they will spend an 18th straight playoffs on the outside. Across their last five games (three losses), the Bills have allowed an average of 28.4 points and 403 yards. With a run-heavy offense and a passing game that is more opportunistic than potent, Buffalo is not built to overcome weekly defensive implosions.OAKLAND RAIDERS (4-5): Here’s an unbelievable statistic: Of the 288 passes thrown against the Raiders, none have been intercepted. They have yielded the highest completion rate, 71.2 percent, and a 110.5 rating to quarterbacks. In a pass-oriented league, Oakland’s potency on offense, highlighted by quarterback Derek Carr and receivers Amari Cooper and Michael Crabtree, is negated by its ineffectiveness on defense. Among the quarterbacks Oakland must still face: Tom Brady, Alex Smith, Carson Wentz and Dak Prescott.MIAMI DOLPHINS (4-4): The Dolphins, the lowest-scoring team in the N.F.L., are here more in deference to their record than for any tangible reason. But Jay Cutler just might provide one. He went from the Fox broadcast booth to the football field when the incumbent quarterback, Ryan Tannehill, hurt his knee. It has taken two months for Cutler to mesh with the team, and across his last two games he has thrown for five touchdowns against one interception with a 120.5 passer rating."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/sports/jaguars-defeat-bills.html,"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Remember how excited everyone was over the surprising upstarts that had qualified for this year’s N.F.L. playoffs?Not since 1964 had customary powers like the Giants, Dallas Cowboys, Green Bay Packers, Washington Redskins and San Francisco 49ers all missed the postseason.Then the Buffalo Bills and Jacksonville Jaguars faced off here Sunday in an A.F.C. wild-card game that played out as if it belonged in 1964 instead of 2018.Not only were there only 13 total points scored in Jacksonville’s 10-3 win over the Bills, but the winning quarterback, Blake Bortles, completed just 12 passes and ran for more yards than he threw for.In the first half, after Bortles and Bills quarterback Tyrod Taylor produced just two passes longer than 10 yards between them, it felt as if both might come out for the second half in high-top shoes and single-bar face masks to complete the 1960s motif.The N.F.L.’s regular season is designed to give weaker teams a fighting chance at a playoff berth, but anyone watching the clumsy, amateurish Buffalo offense was quickly reminded why the Bills had not been in the playoffs since the 1999 season.The same fans may also understand why the Jaguars had not been in the postseason in 10 seasons, either, as their offense was nearly as one-dimensional and inept.Asked about his offense after Sunday’s game, Jacksonville Coach Doug Marrone readily conceded: “I’d be a fool to say I’m not concerned. If you want to keep playing this month, you have to do better than that.”But if there is another takeaway from Sunday’s snoozer of a game, it is this: Jacksonville’s defense is not to be underestimated.Good defensive play is always a top priority whenever the playoff schedule leads to cold-weather climates. Of next weekend’s four divisional-round games, three will be played outdoors in the north. The fourth will be played in Minnesota, but in a domed stadium.Jacksonville will travel to Pittsburgh, where the Jaguars throttled the Steelers, 30-9, in October.In the Jaguars’ locker room after the game Sunday, not surprisingly, no one spent much time talking about the offense.Defensive end Calais Campbell said the theme of the halftime locker room conversation — the score was tied at 3-3 then — was simple.“On defense, we knew if the offense could just get a touchdown then we’d hold that lead from there,” Campbell said.To Marrone’s credit, when his offense stalled at the Buffalo 1-yard line late in the third quarter, he did not demur, electing to go for it on fourth down. Not only that, he opted for deception, lining up in what appeared to be an obvious run formation before tricking the Bills with a fake to running back Leonard Fournette and a quick throw to tight end Ben Koyack in the back of the end zone.It was Bortles’s passing highlight, one of his 12 completions in 23 attempts, which netted only 87 passing yards. Bortles ran for 88 yards on 10 rushing attempts, most of them scrambles out of the pocket.Jacksonville’s usual formula for success is a heavy dose of Fournette, but he struggled to find running room Sunday and gained just 57 yards on 21 carries. He was most ineffective when Jacksonville needed him most — in the fourth quarter as it was trying to protect its narrow lead.But true to its word, the Jaguars defense made the lone touchdown of the game stand up. In doing so, it proved once again why it is one of the N.F.L.’s best.The Bills’ bungling play helped, but the Jaguars’ defense also recorded two interceptions, including late in the game when the unthinkable — a late Bills rally to tie the game — still seemed possible.“Look, we have an attitude and a motto,” said Jacksonville defensive tackle Malik Jackson. “We tell the offense, ‘Hey, just don’t turn over the ball to the other team and we’ll take care of the rest.’“We don’t worry about what the offense is doing — or not doing.”Marrone, for whom the victory must have been heartening because he was once Buffalo’s coach, acknowledged that his defense exemplifies his team’s overall personality. He also noted that there was little panic in the halftime locker room.“We weren’t doing things the way we wanted to do them offensively,” Marrone said. “But this team, like the defense, isn’t easily rattled.”Which may come in handy in Pittsburgh.One thing is certain. As unsightly as Sunday’s game was — for both teams and for all those watching at home — the Jaguars thought it was a beautiful thing.“Playoff football is about winning and moving on — it’s not a beauty contest,” Marrone said. “So you have to remember that.”Around the Jaguars’ locker room, the defensive players were more defiant than their coach.“You don’t apologize in the playoffs,” Campbell said. “We earned the right to move on in the playoffs. Other teams did not. I don’t care what anybody else says, there are no ugly playoff victories.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/01/sports/football/nfl-playoffs-patriots.html,"In the N.F.L.’s first game this season, the New England Patriots lost at home by 15 points. The Patriots defense gave up 42 points and 537 yards. Tom Brady did not throw a touchdown pass and was sacked three times.Clearly, the Patriots’ dynastic romp through the N.F.L. was over. Right? It’s what everyone was saying the next morning.That was when we should have known that the 2017 N.F.L. regular season would defy convention.But did it?The Patriots were 13-2 after their opening night flop. They have the home-field advantage throughout the A.F.C. half of the playoffs. They’re chugging along with boundless ease.At this rate, Brady could become the first player collecting an N.F.L. salary and a Social Security check at the same time. Coach Bill Belichick might end up with more Super Bowl rings than fingers and thumbs. Robert Kraft, the owner, may start skipping the Super Bowl victory ceremony because his shoulders ache from hoisting all those Lombardi trophies.Or maybe not. Because outside of New England’s ceaseless ascendancy, this indeed has been an N.F.L. season that defied convention.As proof, let’s go back to the first week of the 2017 schedule.The Atlanta Falcons pulled out a narrow road victory. Aaron Rodgers led the Green Bay Packers to a hard-fought win. The Dallas Cowboys and the Denver Broncos won authoritatively at home.Those outcomes neatly aligned with preseason expectations. But they turned out to be mirages, or at least poor predictors of what was to come.The Falcons, though they crept into the playoffs, revealed themselves as fragile and erratic. Rodgers’s broken collarbone demonstrated how quarterback-centric the N.F.L. has become, as the Packers collapsed without him. The Cowboys, distracted and weakened by the Ezekiel Elliott suspension saga, stumbled aimlessly until they were no longer relevant. The Broncos went from feared to pitied, squandering a promising 3-1 start with eight consecutive defeats.But elsewhere during the opening week, the results held prescient revelations.The Jacksonville Jaguars had 10 sacks in a romp. The Los Angeles Rams won by 37 points. The Eagles forced four turnovers in a resounding defeat of Washington. The Panthers defense gave up just 3 points and won easily. The Buffalo Bills prevailed in a trap game, soundly dispatching the Jets.Every one of those winners advanced to the playoffs.True, the New Orleans Saints didn’t precisely fit the pattern. They lost in the first week of the season, but they put up a good fight in Minnesota, where only one road team won this season.The Saints have since won 11 of 15 games. And in a twist, a key to their unforeseen surge has been a defense that ranks among the N.F.L.’s top 10 in most statistical categories, a nice complement to what may be the league’s most potent offense.And let’s talk a little about pro football’s postseason tournament, which begins later this week. The most noticeable thing about the playoff bracket? The teams that are not in it.No Packers, Cowboys, Seahawks, Lions or Giants — all of them playoff teams a year ago. The shift of power this season is stark: Eight of the 12 teams in the postseason did not make the playoffs a year ago. Buffalo had not reached the postseason since 1999. In fact, four of the N.F.L.’s six longest playoff droughts ended this season when you include the Rams (2004), the Jaguars (2007) and the Tennessee Titans (2008).It is undoubtedly refreshing to have some new blood involved in an N.F.L. January, but be forewarned. Especially in the N.F.C., the newcomers at the top have little in the way of recent playoff track records.How do you pick a favorite between the top two N.F.C. seeds when Philadelphia’s last playoff victory was in 2008?The Eagles have lost three postseason games since then. Minnesota’s last playoff win was in 2009 — the team is 0-2 since.Since the Eagles have the N.F.C. home-field advantage through the postseason, you could say the road to the Super Bowl goes through Philadelphia, but only if you’re naïve. Just when the Eagles had definitively established themselves as a rising power, a torn knee ligament ended the season of their transformative quarterback, Carson Wentz.Also, playing before their home fans might be the Eagles’ greatest burden. They haven’t won a playoff game at home in 11 seasons.Alas, on the A.F.C. side, there is no worrisome history clouding the minds of the regal and reigning kings of the N.F.L. New England has won its last six home playoff games and is 17-3 in home postseason games during this century.The Pittsburgh Steelers might have the verve and experience to thwart the Patriots, but from an entertainment standpoint, the ideal matchup for the conference title game would have the upstart Jacksonville tramping into New England’s Gillette Stadium.The Jaguars have considerable problems on offense, but their defense is formidable. They are also among the league leaders in sacks. And no one is more aware of how a relentless pass rush can unnerve Tom Brady than Tom Coughlin, the former Giants coach and the driving force behind Jacksonville’s revival.Coughlin’s crafting of the Giants’ two Super Bowl upsets against the Patriots may seem like ancient history, but it is still fresh in his mind. And don’t be fooled by Coughlin’s new, elegant-sounding front office title: executive vice president of the Jaguars. He commandingly roams the sidelines at Jacksonville practices.If the Jaguars get to Gillette this month, Coughlin will be standing at a white board in the days before the game to help concoct a plan that can derail the Patriots’ Super Bowl train.That ending would have a ring of familiarity, and still certify this season as a defiance of convention."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/25/sports/football/pittsburgh-steelers-playoffs.html,"HOUSTON — Steelers quarterback Ben Roethlisberger was 20 of 29 for 226 yards passing and two touchdowns as Pittsburgh clinched a first-round playoff bye with a 34-6 win over the Houston Texans on Monday.Despite lacking Antonio Brown, the N.F.L.’s leading receiver, who sat out with a calf injury, Roethlisberger threw passes to six players as Pittsburgh (12-3) romped past the lowly Texans (4-11).The Steelers led by 20-0 at halftime after taking advantage of two turnovers by the Texans. Le’Veon Bell added a 10-yard scoring run late in the third quarter, and the rookie JuJu Smith-Schuster made it 34-6 with an 18-yard touchdown grab in the fourth.Bell finished with 14 carries for 69 yards, and Smith-Schuster had six receptions for 75 yards.Quarterback T.J. Yates was 7 of 16 for 83 yards and a touchdown for the Texans, who lost their fifth straight game and for the eighth time in nine games. Yates made his second straight start since Tom Savage sustained a concussion. Yates left Monday’s game briefly to be evaluated for a possible concussion, and his replacement, Taylor Heinicke, sustained a concussion on his only full possession.Roethlisberger was replaced by the backup Landry Jones with about six minutes remaining and the game well in hand.The Steelers hurried and harassed Yates all day, Mike Hilton leading the way with three sacks and three quarterback hits while Cameron Heyward had two sacks and forced a fumble.The Texans couldn’t do much right on a day their home stadium was overtaken by vocal Steelers fans waving their Terrible Towels. One of the few highlights came on an acrobatic 3-yard touchdown reception by DeAndre Hopkins in the fourth quarter. Hopkins deflected the ball with his right hand, reeled it in with his left and got both feet down before falling out of bounds for his league-leading 13th touchdown reception of the season.The Steelers took a 10-0 lead when Roethlisberger connected with Justin Hunter on a 5-yard touchdown pass in the first quarter.Alfred Blue had a 48-yard run on the first play of the second quarter to get the Texans to the Pittsburgh 18-yard line. The Texans got to the 1 on second down later in that drive, but couldn’t do anything on the next two plays, and then Yates was intercepted in the end zone.Pittsburgh added a touchdown on a 1-yard run by Roosevelt Nix on the ensuing possession. Heyward sacked Yates three plays later and caused a fumble, which Bud Dupree recovered for the Steelers.Pittsburgh added a 36-yard field goal on the next drive to push the lead to 20-0."
https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/21/sports/nfl-picks-predictions-week-16.html,"There are games with bigger playoff implications — the Falcons-Saints matchup chief among them — but nothing in Week 16 of the N.F.L. season can match the drama of the Seattle Seahawks and the Dallas Cowboys battling to remain relevant in the N.F.C. Some divisions will be decided and the playoff picture will come more into focus in what should be an entertaining holiday weekend of football. Here are our picks against the spread.Last week’s record against the spread: 9-4-2Overall record: 116-99-8Seahawks at Cowboys, 4:25 p.m., FoxLine: Cowboys by 5Running back Ezekiel Elliott did not want to talk about the time he spent away from the Cowboys (8-6) thanks to a six-game suspension after a yearlong investigation into domestic violence accusations. All that is really known is that he went to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and kept in shape. His teammates initially fell apart, then figured things out. They were 3-3 without him.Elliott returns to a team that is clinging to a 9 percent chance of making the playoffs, according to The Upshot’s Playoff Simulator. The Cowboys, though, expect that the reunification of Elliott and Dak Prescott will mean they will win their final two games. Even if they do, beating the Seahawks (8-6, 14 percent playoff chance) and the Eagles, a wild-card entry would require leapfrogging the Falcons and the Lions.Coach Jason Garrett was cagey about how involved Elliott would be in the offense. But Elliott seems to thrive with more work, and it would not be a surprise to see him carry the ball 25 times or more. In a productive four-game stretch leading up to his suspension, he averaged 28.8 carries a game and scored six total touchdowns as Dallas was 4-0.The Seahawks are coming off a brutal loss to the Rams that seemed like a nail in their coffin. They were trying to remain relevant after losing defensive backs Richard Sherman and Kam Chancellor for the season. Coach Pete Carroll was quick to point out that while a 42-7 loss was hard to look at, two weeks before that, Seattle beat the Eagles in a dominant effort.“This is not easy at all,” Carroll said when asked about the Cowboys game. “Two 8-6 teams battling for it, and there’s a lot at stake. Everything is on the line for both of us.” Pick: CowboysFalcons at Saints, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Saints by 5.5The Saints (10-4, 93 percent) have dominated the discussion of the N.F.C. South this season thanks to their running game and secondary finally living up to the talent of Drew Brees, their future Hall of Famer at quarterback. But even with their sterling record and their well-balanced approach, the Saints have yet to clinch the division, and will need help if they are going to do it this week. To summarize, New Orleans needs to beat the Falcons (9-5, 83 percent) while Carolina loses to Tampa Bay. The former is fairly likely, while the latter seems like a stretch, so the division could easily come down to Week 17. Pick: SaintsJaguars at 49ers, 4:05 p.m., CBSLine: Jaguars by 4.5At a glance, this may seem like a comical mismatch. The Jaguars (10-4, clinched playoff berth) have been one of the best teams in the N.F.L. for most of the season; the 49ers (4-10, eliminated) had a good chance to get the top pick in the 2018 draft just a few weeks ago. San Francisco does not technically have anything to play for, but it has become an intriguing team since acquiring Jimmy Garoppolo at quarterback. The 49ers are 3-0 since Garoppolo, the former Patriots backup, began starting, and while Chicago, Houston and Tennessee cannot compare to the Jaguars, they would have been expected to crush the youthful 49ers back when Brian Hoyer and C. J. Beathard were under center. The Jaguars, though, have some real incentive to come away with a win: They would clinch the A.F.C. South and stay alive for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. It’s unlikely the 49ers can match that intensity, even with Garoppolo. Pick: JaguarsRams at Titans, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Rams by 6.5The ascension of the Rams (10-4, 98 percent) from last season has been so swift and effective that they find themselves as heavy road favorites against a team projected to make the playoffs. It is not hard to figure out where the confidence comes from, as Jared Goff and Todd Gurley put on a show nearly every week, posting some outrageous victories while averaging an N.F.L.-leading 31.3 points a game. The Titans (8-6, 66 percent) have persevered through plenty of issues, but they may end up lost in a pack of teams vying for the two wild cards in the A.F.C., if they cannot find a way to beat Los Angeles. Pick: RamsBills at Patriots, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Patriots by 12Just a typical matchup between a pair of teams in line for playoff spots in the A.F.C. Sure, the Bills (8-6, 43 percent) have been outscored by 42 points this season and had a weird meltdown where they tried and failed to bench their starting quarterback, but at least for this week they are simply rubbing shoulders with their playoff-bound peers, the Patriots (11-3, clinched A.F.C. East). Two weeks ago, New England beat Buffalo 23-3, and that was in Buffalo. With home-field advantage in the playoffs still in doubt, and the Patriots gunning for a win in Foxborough, the Bills’ playoff hopes will be collateral damage. Pick: PatriotsVikings at Packers, 8:30 p.m. (Saturday), NBCLine: Vikings by 9The window is starting to close for the Vikings (11-3, clinched N.F.C. North) to have home-field advantage throughout the playoffs in the same season that their stadium is hosting the Super Bowl. They trail Philadelphia by a game, and the Eagles held strong in Week 15 even without quarterback Carson Wentz. First things first: Minnesota has to keep winning, which should be easier than expected since the Packers (7-7, eliminated) shut Aaron Rodgers down for the season once they were officially eliminated from playoff contention. It will be cold at Lambeau Field, and the Packers will try to use that to their advantage, but Minnesota has the front seven, led by Everson Griffen and Linval Joseph, to make Brett Hundley sweat on a 1-degree day, and it has the secondary to make Hundley pay for any mistakes. Pick: VikingsBuccaneers at Panthers, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Panthers by 10The Panthers (10-4, 91 percent) have had plenty of off-field trouble this year, but their path to the playoffs on the field is incredibly straightforward: Beat the Buccaneers (4-10, eliminated) or have Dallas and Seattle tie. Winning against Tampa Bay, at home, seems much simpler, and the Panthers are certainly capable of doing it, even with Thomas Davis, one of their top linebackers, suspended for a hit he delivered in Week 15. There is a fear, though, that Cam Newton and the offense will not push hard enough to justify the 10-point spread. Pick: BuccaneersDolphins at Chiefs, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Chiefs by 10.5The Dolphins (6-8, 3 percent) have wins this season against New England and Atlanta, but they have losses against Oakland and Tampa Bay. Figuring out the true value of this team is something that will not happen until next year, when Ryan Tannehill is ready to return at quarterback. Against the Chiefs (8-6, 95 percent), there is no realistic reason to think Miami will have a chance, especially since Kansas City can secure a division title with a win. Miami just might make things close, even if the Chiefs take care of business and win. Pick: DolphinsColts at Ravens, 4:30 p.m. (Saturday), NFL NetworkLine: Ravens by 13.5The Ravens (8-6, 80 percent) are sitting fairly pretty in terms of postseason prospects despite being the No. 7 seed in a field that sends six teams to the playoffs. The confidence that it will all work out comes from the team ahead of them, Buffalo, having found ways not to make the playoffs every year since 1999. The fact that the Bills are playing New England is just icing on the cake. Baltimore, though, needs to keep winning, which should not be too difficult against the Colts (3-11, eliminated). Winning is one thing, but Baltimore probably can’t justify the enormous point spread. Pick: ColtsChargers at Jets, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Chargers by 6.5The Chargers (7-7, 13 percent) made a nice little run at the A.F.C. West, but a loss to Kansas City in Week 15 all but crushed that dream. Luckily they play in the A.F.C., where the bar for playoff contention is very low, so they still have a chance to make it if they keep winning and Buffalo and Baltimore fade quickly. The Jets (5-9, eliminated), though, are feisty at home, where they have a 6-1 record in terms of beating the point spread. The Chargers are likely to win, but even with Bryce Petty at quarterback it could be fairly close. Pick: JetsGiants at Cardinals, 4:25 p.m., FoxLine: Cardinals by 3.5One of only three games that start after 4 p.m., Eastern time, on Christmas Eve, this one will require some serious devotion from fans for it to get much viewership. The Giants (2-12, eliminated) have had a season notable only for how they disrespected a franchise icon, and the Cardinals (6-8, eliminated) will go back to Drew Stanton at quarterback after having publicly flirted with the idea that Blaine Gabbert could be a solution going forward. Pick: GiantsBrowns at Bears, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Bears by 6.5If the Browns (0-14, eliminated) are going to win a game this season, this would be the time to do it. They are facing the scrappy Bears (4-10, eliminated), which will not help DeShone Kizer’s propensity for turnovers, but this still figures to be a far better matchup for Cleveland than Pittsburgh will be in Week 17, especially if the Steelers are fighting for home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. An 0-16 season would not be unprecedented, thanks to the 2008 Detroit Lions, but should Cleveland lose its two remaining games, its two-season mark of 1-31 would be worse than the 2-30 mark that the Lions put up in 2008 and 2009. Pick: BrownsLions at Bengals, 1 p.m., FoxLine: Lions by 4.5Despite plenty of twists and turns, the Lions (8-6, 13 percent) are a game out of the N.F.C.’s second wild-card spot. Should they continue to win, and the Falcons falter, Detroit could end up making the playoffs for a second consecutive year for the first time since they qualified in three straight years from 1993 to 1995. The Bengals (5-9, eliminated) will have some extra motivation in what appears to be Coach Marvin Lewis’s final home game after 15 years with the team. That may let them stay close enough to beat the point spread, if not win outright. Pick: BengalsBroncos at Redskins, 1 p.m., CBSLine: Redskins by 3.5There are no implications in this matchup of eliminated teams, but the Broncos (5-9) can use the game as an on-the-job audition for how much money they want to throw at Kirk Cousins of the Redskins (6-8) this off-season. Barring Washington’s using the franchise tag on him for a third consecutive year, he may finally be allowed to test the open market. There are few teams that would benefit more from a player of his skill than Denver. That being said, Cousins has his work cut out for him against a Broncos defense that still has star-level players. Pick: RedskinsSteelers at Texans, 4:30 p.m., NBCLine: Steelers by 9The Steelers (11-3, clinched) were a “surviving the ground” call away from beating the Patriots last weekend, which would have secured home-field advantage throughout the playoffs. But it was determined that Jesse James did not hold on to what would have been a go-ahead touchdown catch. A few plays later, Ben Roethlisberger threw an interception that sealed Pittsburgh’s fate. Rubbing some salt in the wound was the fact that the interception was thrown on a route in which Antonio Brown, the N.F.L.’s best wide receiver, would typically be receiving the ball, but Brown, who injured his calf earlier, was being evaluated at a hospital instead.The Steelers can still clinch a first-round bye with one more win — a loss or tie by Jacksonville would suffice as well — but New England holds a tiebreaker over them for home-field advantage, so if they want that honor they will need some help: at least one loss by the Patriots.Against the Texans (4-10, eliminated), the Steelers will be playing without Brown, who is hoping to return during the playoffs. To replace him, Pittsburgh will have to hope JuJu Smith-Schuster, who has thrived this year despite being the N.F.L.’s youngest player, can replace some of Brown’s production. The Steelers should win, but without Brown a spread of 9 points is too large. Pick: TexansRaiders at Eagles, 8:30 p.m., ESPNLine: Eagles by 8.5Nick Foles had a statistical line worthy of Carson Wentz in his first start this season for the Eagles (12-2, clinched N.F.C. East and first-round bye). The former backup, asked to take over the N.F.C.’s top team when Wentz was lost for the season, threw for 238 yards and four touchdowns in a win over the Giants. It should probably be a bit troubling that Philadelphia was able to beat the hapless Giants by only 5 points, but it is hard to put too much blame for that on Foles, and he will try to secure home-field advantage throughout the playoffs with a win over the Raiders (6-8, <1 percent). Another four-touchdown game is not realistic, but a return to form by the team’s defense would make up most of the difference, even if a point spread of 8.5 points is at least a bit too high. Pick: Raiders"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/14/sports/jaguars-beat-steelers.html,"PITTSBURGH — In an endlessly surprising year for the N.F.L., filled with attacks on the league from a sitting president, a politically charged debate over the national anthem, and more controversy over the league’s handling of its concussion protocol, perhaps what happened here Sunday on a frigid afternoon was only fitting.The Jacksonville Jaguars, a franchise that had not won a division title since Bill Clinton was president, upset the Pittsburgh Steelers, those mighty six-time Super Bowl champions, by 45-42 in a divisional-round game that was not actually that close. The result upended expectations for the rest of the playoffs.The Steelers were supposed to be the last team capable of stopping the New England Patriots, who will appear in their seventh consecutive conference title game next week. Instead, the Jaguars — that’s right, the usually hapless Jaguars! — will try to deny the Patriots a third Super Bowl berth in four years. The N.F.L. will have to wait at least another year for a Patriots-Steelers showdown that would have been a shot in the arm to the league’s sagging television ratings.Maybe hubris played a part. The Steelers finished the season with 13 wins and might have claimed home field through the A.F.C. playoffs had a touchdown pass to tight end Jesse James in a game against the Patriots last month not been overturned by a controversial call. The Steelers have burned for a second shot at New England ever since.On Saturday, Steelers running back Le’Veon Bell seemed be looking past the Jaguars when he wrote on Twitter that “we’ll have two round 2’s in back to back weeks,” a reference to a rematch with the Patriots.The Jaguars, who had the second-stingiest defense in the league this season, took umbrage.“It disrespected us,” defensive lineman Malik Jackson said of the tweet. “They were overlooking us like we weren’t anything.”The Steelers were favorites against Jacksonville on Sunday, but their confidence required some optimism that history would not repeat itself.That was because the Jaguars had trounced the Steelers, 30-9, in Week 5, a game that fueled Jacksonville’s run to its first division title in nearly two decades and its first winning season since 2007. But the Steelers were missing several key players in their earlier matchup, and the Jaguars’ much-improved offense had slowed late in the season.It was not to be. The Jaguars shocked the Steelers in a topsy-turvy slugfest that sent Jacksonville to the A.F.C. championship game for the first time since the 1999 season, and the Steelers to the video room to see what had gone so wrong so fast.Given the long odds of the Jaguars’ staging yet another big upset on the road and in the cold weather, it may be left to the Eagles or the Vikings to do what nearly everyone outside the northeast corner of the United States would prefer — knocking the Patriot freight train off its rails.For the moment, though, the focus is on the Jaguars, whose performance was as surprising as was the demise of the Steelers, who yielded 45 points, tied for the most the storied franchise has ever given up in a playoff game. Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger looked brilliant at times, throwing for 469 yards and five touchdowns, and flummoxed at others — much the way he did when the Jaguars intercepted five of his passes in their game in October.“To lose this at home, I know there will be some to say we had a great season, thanks for the ride,” Roethlisberger said. “But a lot of them are disappointed like we are. It wasn’t enough.”As Jackson suggested, the Jaguars are not the same team that spent a decade without a winning season. In addition to drafting running back Leonard Fournette, who ran for 109 yards and three touchdowns Sunday, the Jaguars hired Tom Coughlin to oversee the team’s football operations. His veteran presence — he won two Super Bowls with the Giants — appeared to take the team to a new level.Fortunately for the Jaguars, Coughlin knows a little about what it takes to beat New England in the playoffs. (See: Super Bowls XLII and XLVI.)He will most likely have plenty to say this week. Whatever advice he gave Jaguars Coach Doug Marrone seemed to work on Sunday. Jacksonville raced down the field on the opening drive. Rather than settle for a field goal, Marrone went for a touchdown on fourth down, and Fournette made him look smart when he plunged into the end zone from 1 yard out.The Steelers appeared poised to even the score, but the Jaguars’ defense stood tall. Linebacker Myles Jack picked off Roethlisberger’s pass on the Steelers’ 18-yard line, and Fournette scored on the next play.The sellout crowd of 64,524 at Heinz Field, where it was 18 degrees at kickoff, squirmed.“The way our defense has played all year, there hasn’t been many games where we’ve had to go back out and score again,” Jacksonville quarterback Blake Bortles said. But, he added, “we continued to score and give our defense a little bit of space.”Bortles, who looked lost in the team’s victory over the Buffalo Bills in the wild-card round, was more sure-footed against the Steelers, completing 14 of 26 passes for 214 yards, one touchdown and, critically, no interceptions.True to form, the Steelers charged back in the second half, with Roethlisberger throwing touchdown passes to Bell, Antonio Brown and JuJu Smith-Schuster. But the Jaguars kept matching the Steelers’ scores. After Bortles hit fullback Tommy Bohanon with a 14-yard touchdown pass with just over four minutes remaining to put his team ahead by 42-28, most of the fans in Heinz Field headed for the exits.Outside the Jaguars’ locker room, the team’s owner, Shahid Khan, had a wide smile. His team won just 17 games in the first five seasons after he bought the team, the worst record in the N.F.L. during that stretch. Just having a winning record would have been welcome. But the team won the A.F.C. South, then won its first playoff home game of the 21st century.It was all supposed to come to a crashing halt here in Pittsburgh, where the Steelers have been dominant in the playoffs. The cold weather was supposed to favor the home team, not the one from Florida. The Steelers’ lineup was stacked with All-Pro talent.So Khan had an understandably dazed look when he was asked if he could have imagined the Jaguars making it this far.Speaking of past years, Khan said, “Our season would have been over a month ago or more, and it would have been, ‘What are we doing in the off-season?’” Then he added, wistfully, “To me, just to be talking about being relevant in December would have been nice.”For the first time, Khan can enjoy relevant games in January."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/sports/football/jets-fire-general-manager-mike-tannenbaum.html,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — A distinct pattern has emerged for the Jets these last two years: the day after their final game is as bizarre and disorienting a spectacle as their season itself. It is a tradition like no other.This is what was supposed to happen Monday, a full two weeks after the Jets, hurtling toward 6-10, were eliminated from the playoff chase: they would dismiss General Manager Mike Tannenbaum and their offensive coordinator, Tony Sparano, with a strong voice — Coach Rex Ryan or, better yet, the owner Woody Johnson — discussing the moves later in the day.This is what did happen Monday: the Jets fired Tannenbaum, whose 15-year tenure with the Jets ended because of a failure to restock its talent base, while Sparano dangled, Ryan hunkered down, and Johnson avoided the public eye, his five-paragraph statement regarding Tannenbaum notwithstanding.There was no explanation why Ryan’s scheduled news conference was canceled other than an opaque response from a team spokesman: “an organizational decision.” That decision left D’Brickashaw Ferguson, Joe McKnight and Chaz Schilens, among others, to speak on behalf of the team on a day when the Jets made their most important move since hiring Ryan almost four years ago.All around the league Monday, from Philadelphia to Cleveland to Arizona, coaches were canned and executives sacked. Yet on a mournful day, accountability still reigned. Team owners, or high-ranking officials, answered questions and explained those organizations’ thought processes. Even Norv Turner, fired as San Diego’s coach, had a farewell news conference.The Jets are often criticized for being tone-deaf and for making the wrong move — or the right one, just far too late. On Monday, it seemed altogether fitting that they made what was widely viewed as the proper decision for their future but still managed to bungle it.Johnson’s absence from Sunday’s 28-9 loss at Buffalo was conspicuous and, indeed, foreboding. Rather than watch another aimless defeat with the man he would soon fire, Johnson stayed back, planning for the future.The Jets have already hired Jed Hughes of the recruiting firm Korn/Ferry to lead the search for Tannenbaum’s replacement. Potential candidates include the Miami Dolphins’ assistant general manager, Brian Gaine, a Rockland County native and a disciple of Bill Parcells’s; Tom Gamble, the San Francisco 49ers’ director of player personnel; and Marc Ross, the Giants’ director of college scouting.“Like all Jets fans, I am disappointed with this year’s results,” Johnson said in his statement. “However, I am confident that this change will best position our team for greater success going forward.”No doubt the Jets’ position is appealing; only 32 of these jobs exist, after all. But whoever takes over for Tannenbaum will inherit a mess at quarterback, several bloated contracts and a roster in dire need of an overhaul, not to mention a coach he did not choose in Ryan, whose return in 2013 Johnson guaranteed.This season was doomed by a pair of decisions made in a two-week stretch in March — extending quarterback Mark Sanchez’s contract and acquiring Tim Tebow.Guaranteeing Sanchez $20.5 million seemed to lack foresight as well as financial restraint. Sanchez regressed, losing his starting job — not to mention the confidence of some teammates — and committing 26 turnovers.The Jets then surrendered two draft picks and $2.53 million to Denver over three years for Tebow, who proved nothing more than a distraction and a decoy, frustrated with the Jets’ inability to integrate him into their offense.Tebow amounted to the team’s lone significant addition on offense, raising a concern over the summer that has since been validated: that Tannenbaum failed to surround Sanchez with enough talent. Even before injuries to Santonio Holmes, Dustin Keller and Stephen Hill, the Jets lacked playmakers.Tannenbaum also backed the hiring of Sparano, who presided over the 30th-ranked offense in the N.F.L. The unit scored 10 or fewer points in seven games, and its inexperience in quarterback development and play-calling produced an offense that lacked creativity, ambition and direction.Tannenbaum, 43, leaves a complex legacy with the Jets, who hired him in February 1997 as a salary-cap expert and elevated him to general manager nine years later to replace Terry Bradway. Under Tannenbaum, the Jets were 57-55 in seven seasons, reaching the playoffs three times — but they last qualified in 2010, when they advanced to their second consecutive A.F.C. Championship game.History will remember Tannenbaum for selecting cornerstones like Ferguson, Nick Mangold and Darrelle Revis and for his aggressive moves in free agency and the trade market that repositioned the Jets as contenders.But he was also guilty of overvaluing and misjudging players, failing to fill the roster with adequate depth and, particularly in the past few years, overseeing a draft haul meager in quality and quantity. Tannenbaum’s riskiest move — trading up to select Sanchez fifth over all in 2009 — yielded immediate gratification but fleeting success.After being dismissed Monday morning, Tannenbaum spoke to the team he assembled. He told the players that he believed in them and that “there are champions on this team that haven’t been crowned yet,” a sentiment he later expressed in a statement issued by the team.Tight end Jeff Cumberland called Tannenbaum’s speech “real emotional.” Sanchez said it was “heartfelt.” The players, Revis said, “felt sorry” for him.At the end, everyone clapped. For a team embarrassed by Bart Scott’s obscene gesture to a photographer during the 2011 post-mortem, consider the reaction, unlike aspects of the day, progress."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/sports/football/fixation-on-jets-greater-than-for-giants.html,"East Rutherford, N.J.To lighten the mood of the Giants’ season’s eulogy, Tom Coughlin sprinkled a few well-intended quips into his coach’s 2012 assessment — but Billy Crystal he is not. General Manager Jerry Reese, next to the podium, added, “Wish I had something clever to say, but we didn’t get the job done.”Typical Giants, in button-down blue. For inspired rhetoric or slapstick, we would have had to venture a few miles west of East Rutherford, to Florham Park, where the Jets were also bidding us adieu. But after announcing the removal of General Manager Mike Tannenbaum on Monday morning, they mysteriously canceled Coach Rex Ryan’s scheduled late afternoon meeting with reporters.Let the speculation reign and the headlines roll.There will be no playoff football played by either New York-area team, but in keeping with the behavioral patterns of the respective organizations, the Giants could at least point to and rue a handful of plays in explaining their failure to earn an opportunity to defend their Super Bowl title.Meanwhile, the Jets finished as they started, a bleating ensemble of confusion bordering on chaos.With the exception of most Sundays, it is difficult to argue that they didn’t provide first-rate entertainment, even if they — an 8-8 study in mediocrity last season, devolving to a 6-10 train Rex — never deserved the equal and sometimes superior billing they got with their MetLife Stadium co-tenant. If Tim Tebow was — as many have postulated — the owner Woody Johnson’s trophy acquisition to counter the Giants’ Super Bowl hardware, consider that marketing a rousing success.The Jets sold counterfeit quarterback chronicles that we — especially the New York news media — bought hook, line and laptop. Marginally talented and mostly tethered to the sideline, Tebow somehow drew more attention than Eli Manning, a two-time Super Bowl most valuable player, whose admittedly uneven performance this season was certainly worthy of weekly dissection.There has always been a pecking order in the coverage of the crowded New York sports market, based not only on location (Knicks over Nets) but often on performance (Yankees over Mets).During Ryan’s first two years that produced successive trips to the A.F.C. Championship game, much was made by him and others of how the Jets had taken ownership of the real estate. Then there was a fateful Giants-Jets meeting last season, the day before Christmas, when everything Ryan had worked for was spectacularly reversed in the blink of Victor Cruz’s bursting into the clear.Yes, the Giants gave every indication that there was no point in worrying about them this season — not until the playoffs — by storming out to a three-game divisional lead. And Ryan’s Jets were that difficult-to-miss distraction, the figurative brawl breaking out in a high school cafeteria.Still, there was something disquieting about how effective they were at commanding the spotlight with their nonsense narratives, with their Wildcat formation that never really was, and with Ryan’s bluster that belied so much early evidence that his playmaker-challenged team was going to be no good.“The fact that we’re picked fourth in our division or third by some — really?” he said on the day the Jets convened for summer camp in upstate New York. Really, they finished tied for third and fourth with Buffalo, one of seven N.F.L. teams to fire their coaches on Monday.With Tannenbaum out and Tony Sparano likely to become the second offensive coordinator thrown under the bus in two years, Ryan may not coach forever but he should have a fine future as a contestant on “Survivor.” And with Tebow all but gone, the Jets should be able to restock the gossip columns for a year or two by forcing the new general manager to play nice with Ryan whether he thinks Ryan is a good coach or not. Good luck to them.Back in the Giants’ locker room, the defensive end Justin Tuck nodded when it was suggested to him that reporters were obsessed with Ryan’s Jets and should have known from the start that they were just a competitive tease.“I could have told you that,” he said, laughing. “But honestly, we don’t care about the attention they got. We hope the Jets continue to get all the headlines. It makes things a lot simpler for us.“You know, some teams kind of relish being in the spotlight. Our spotlight comes from winning football games.”In the most simple of final analyses, the Giants didn’t win enough games despite finishing with the same record, 9-7, as last season. “We got away with it last year,” Reese said, referring to that ever-shifting line of N.F.L. success for teams not at the competitive extremes.There are no guarantees, but the Giants, unlike the Jets, do have the organizational stability and blueprint for success, and a proven quarterback.Manning said he would most regret the road loss to Washington, when the Giants could have put Robert Griffin III and his divisional upstarts away. Coughlin also mentioned that game, along with blowing a 10-point lead in the fourth quarter at home to Pittsburgh and losing at Philadelphia, where Manning’s decision to throw long when already close enough for a winning field goal attempt resulted in a damning offensive-pass-interference call.Given that the Giants were fortunate to salvage a late victory over the Redskins at home, losing to the Eagles should probably haunt them the most.At least the season is far from over for the family Manning. After doubling Peyton’s Super Bowl ring total last February, Eli said he would now root for Peyton, who is trying to author one of the great comeback stories in Denver. Think of what the brothers have achieved in recent years and then about how much we all were fixated these past few months on Tebow, Mark Sanchez and Greg McElroy.Embarrassing, isn’t it?"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/sports/football/giants-insist-theyre-better-than-finish.html,"EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. — Giants Coach Tom Coughlin challenged his players Sunday night to gather explanations for what happened to the team down the stretch this season, although by Monday morning, the concrete answers still had not come. They probably never will.The Christmas decorations were down, the shiny gray garbage bags were out, and a new, unspoken feeling permeated the locker room, one that had not been felt in more than a year: regret.“You feel like you’ve been punched in the stomach a little bit,” defensive end Justin Tuck said Monday, the day after the team’s season ended. “You know we have a high-quality football team that could make a lot of noise in the playoffs if that would’ve happened, but it didn’t.”Wild swings of inconsistency haunted the Giants, the defending Super Bowl champions who missed the playoffs for a second time in three seasons. Personnel changes are inevitable in the coming days.General Manager Jerry Reese said an evaluation process was only just being started, and Coughlin indicated he wanted the entire coaching staff, including the defensive coordinator Perry Fewell, to return for 2013. But with nearly two dozen restricted and unrestricted free agents on the roster, there will certainly be tweaks.“I don’t think we’re that far off, to be honest,” Reese said. “This team will look different, but I think we have a good core coming back.”The defense will be examined most sharply. It dropped off significantly in almost every statistical category from the previous season. The Giants finished 31st in the league in total defense, 25th against the rush, 30th in third-down defense and 32nd in sacks, all with largely the same players that buoyed their championship run.Fewell, in his third year as the coordinator, took criticism, but Coughlin did not pin the blame solely on his work and system.“Based on what was said by Perry Fewell, the thing that was not happening was plays were not being made,” Coughlin said. “I don’t think the defense would disagree with you at all on that one.”Reese’s only real pointed comments Monday were directed at a defense that struggled down the stretch without forcing a turnover against Atlanta or Baltimore.“We expect our defense to play better than that,” Reese said. “We think we had some good players defensively. There were some plays that needed to be made that didn’t get made.”Linebacker Chase Blackburn and safeties Kenny Phillips and Stevie Brown are free agents, and there may be other changes in store. Defensive end Osi Umenyiora has already said he does not expect to be back; the same might be said for defensive back Corey Webster. Tuck said his four sacks this season were unacceptable.“My performance is nowhere near where I envisioned for myself coming into training camp,” Tuck said. “I am disappointed in my play.”The general mood in the locker room, though, was not particularly depressed. Some players spoke remorsefully about how the final month played out, with blowout losses to Atlanta and Baltimore; others seemed dazed that there were no film sessions or practices ahead.Tight end Martellus Bennett, another free agent, planned to lobby Reese to sign his brother, Michael, a free-agent defensive end with Tampa Bay, so they could car-pool together.“It saves on gas money,” Bennett quipped.The overwhelming tone was optimism that the team did not need to do much to get back into the postseason. Coughlin said some of the finest games he had seen since arriving were played this year, and the losses that bothered him most were by a combined 3 points, to Philadelphia and to Washington.“This whole off-season, everybody’s going to try to knock you down and say you’re in the same boat as teams that won two games,” Tuck said. “We’re not, we’re not. We still have a very quality football team.”Safety Antrel Rolle said the main problem was consistency, and he spoke critically of what he perceived as dips in effort on defense at times this season.“When it was there, you could see it, nobody had to question it,” Rolle said. “There was also times when we weren’t playing Giants football. I think it was quite obvious at times.”The Giants finished 9-7 last season, sneaked into the postseason, ran the table, and performed their exit interviews in early February before hopping on buses headed toward a parade through the Canyon of Heroes. A 9-7 record did not go the same way this year.“It’s not pleasant,” Coughlin said. “It’s not pleasant at all. Why? Because you expect so much more, and rightfully so.”EXTRA POINTSReceiver Hakeem Nicks said he was unsure if he would need off-season surgery to repair his injured left knee, which had been bothering him since Week 4. He admitted he was never able to get back to 100 percent. “I was never quite myself,” Nicks said Monday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/sports/baseball/card-collectors-hold-on-to-mike-piazzas-stint-with-marlins.html,"One is a corporate lawyer from Southern California with few hobbies and only the mildest interest in sports. The other is a college student from Miami who is less than half his age and has amassed a stash of memorabilia that matches his love of baseball.Yet from opposite ends of the country they share one peculiar passion: collecting trading cards of Mike Piazza in a Florida Marlins uniform.Never mind that Piazza played just five games for the Marlins in May 1998, a mere pit stop on his way from the Los Angeles Dodgers to the Mets. Never mind that he did nothing of note during that stint, except hit his only triple of the season. The closest either man has been to Piazza is waving to him from the stands.Yet for Jerry Dworkin, 59, and Chris Fernandez, 25, there is no greater thrill than finding one of the more than 120 Piazza Marlins cards issued from 1998 to 2005.“I can’t deny it is obscure,” said Dworkin, who lives in Irvine, Calif., and admitted to spending five figures to accumulate more than 100 cards. “I’m not a baseball expert. I’m just a run-of-the-mill guy who got caught up in the oddity of the situation, someone as great as Mike Piazza being on a team for just five games.”Fernandez, who keeps 59 Piazza Marlins cards in a cigar box, was more concise: “We kind of marvel at it.”Fans may marvel at their cards if Piazza’s election to the Hall of Fame, in his first year of eligibility, is announced on Jan. 9. Typically, a player’s rookie cards get the biggest boost from Hall entry. Piazza played most of his career in Los Angeles and New York, so the cards from those years are likely to appreciate more than his Marlins cards do, collecting experts said.Yet sports collecting is fueled by an unending flow of players who wear an endless number of uniforms and gear. And when a baseball player makes it to the Hall of Fame, some of his biggest fans will spend great sums to commemorate the moment.Trading cards are the most obvious investments because they have been around for so long and are relatively inexpensive.Years ago, scarcity and a player’s popularity drove demand. The T206 Honus Wagner issued in 1909 is the most famous card in part because few exist.Card collecting has grown immensely since then, and manufacturers have become adept at celebrating even the most obscure achievements, including Piazza’s five-game stretch for the team now known as the Miami Marlins. They recognized the peculiarity of an All-Star like Piazza being traded twice in a brief span and the potential market for his Marlins cards, and flooded the market with dozens of cards, diluting their impact.“They want to create draws for a product and will issue cards in a unique circumstance, but then beat it to death,” Tom Bartsch, the editor of Sports Collectors Digest, said of the card makers. “It’s a tactic they use to get people to buy as much product as possible. But it’s also turned a lot of people off of collecting.”The flood has limited the value of the cards, most of which sell for just a few dollars on eBay and other sites. But the value of the cards is less important to Dworkin and Fernandez than the chase to complete the Piazza Marlins collection.Dworkin saw Piazza play a few times for the Dodgers and was disappointed when he was traded. While Dworkin did not collect cards, he quickly grasped that the Piazza Marlins cards could be valuable, though he insisted that turning a profit was not his motive.“The collection as a whole has a greater value than any part,” he said.Dworkin spends a few minutes every morning browsing Web sites for baseball card traders, and he bids actively on eBay if he finds something he does not own. He has bought cards from traders as far away as Taiwan and spent months trying to buy one-of-a-kind cards, often unsuccessfully. Once, he paid a promoter about $350 to get Piazza, who rarely attends collectors shows, to sign one of his cards.Over the years, Dworkin has found others who share his obsession, but none more so than Fernandez, who began his fixation with Piazza in April 1993. That’s when the newly minted Marlins made their debut as a franchise against the Dodgers. He recalled seeing Piazza’s name on the scoreboard that day and thinking that it sounded like pizza.Fernandez kept an eye on Piazza from afar and was ecstatic when the Marlins traded Bobby Bonilla, Gary Sheffield and three other players to the Dodgers for Piazza and Todd Zeile. But his joy was cut short when Piazza was shipped to New York in a lopsided deal.“When he was traded to the Marlins, I was happy as heck, so I went out looking for cards,” Fernandez said. “I found out he was traded when I got home on my birthday. I cried like an 11-year-old.”He kept collecting Piazza cards and jerseys as well as ticket stubs from four out of the five games Piazza played for the Marlins, only two of which were at home. He has scoured card shows and shops and, of course, bid for cards online.But Fernandez was outbid with an uncanny regularity. It was only after he met Dworkin through a collectors Web site that he discovered who was besting him.“I thought I’d get them cheap, but no matter what I’d bid, he’d win,” Fernandez said. “I found out Jerry was out there and he was the reason I couldn’t get them. Knowing him now, I knew I was never going to win.”The two rivals shared tips about what cards were available, feeding their fixation.“It became a race: I’d go hunt one down and he’d grab it and vice versa,” said Fernandez, who claims to have spent about $1,000 on Piazza Marlins cards. “Most of the better cards I’ve lost out to Jerry, but my wallet thanked me.”Despite their constant contact over the Internet, they have never met or spoken on the phone. Still, “the friendship kept me going,” Dworkin said.“I gained an appreciation of the collector community,” he said. “He was someone I could talk to about it.”Dworkin said he would love to meet Fernandez in Cooperstown if Piazza makes it into the Hall of Fame.Given how popular Piazza was, Dworkin and Fernandez are likely to have a lot of company. Piazza has indicated that he would like to be inducted as a Met, and there is no chance of his wearing a teal and black Marlins cap.Piazza’s agent did not return calls seeking comment from his client about his time on the Marlins. But Piazza appears to see the humor in the tiny cult of fans who savor his time in Florida. At the end of the 2011 season, he accepted an invitation from the Marlins to help close out the team’s tenure at Sun Life Stadium. Standing with Marlins mainstays like Sheffield and Jeff Conine, Piazza smiled and waved to the fans, including Fernandez, who wore a Piazza replica jersey to the stadium that day.“You could see on the JumboTron that he appreciated the joke,” Fernandez said."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/us/a-church-saloon-combo-in-an-arizona-town.html,"CAVE CREEK, Ariz. — From an improvised pulpit nestled on a slice of desert sand between a bull-riding ring and a bar serving biscuits and $3 beers, the preacher opened his last sermon of the year with a question and a revelation.“How many of you have ever been a suspect in a murder case?” he asked, his blue eyes scanning a small flock of congregants huddled around a pile of burning logs. “I have.”Steve Gilbertson, 52, has been a preacher for about 30 years. Four months ago, he started a church of his own. At his last job, he had led an informal Sunday morning service over coffee and doughnuts at a local megachurch. Now he preaches under a mesquite tree, in the shadow of a saloon best known for the quality of its country-western bands and the fervor of its regulars’ allegiance to the Green Bay Packers.The saloon is called the Buffalo Chip, and the church it houses, officially named Ecclesia, is informally known as Church at the Chip, or cowboy church. Mr. Gilbertson and the saloon’s owner, Larry Wendt, met several years ago at the church where Mr. Gilbertson worked and that Mr. Wendt sometimes attended. Mr. Wendt remembered asking him to come by on Fridays to say a prayer before bulls and riders took to the ring, on the edge of a knoll punctuated by saguaro cactus. When he heard Mr. Gilbertson needed a place for his church, he offered him space at the saloon.“I spend all week making sinners out of our good cowboys and cowgirls, selling them drinks and a lot of food,” Mr. Wendt said. “The least I can do is try to straighten them out a little on Sundays.”Alcohol and religion might seem incongruous, but the combination is not new. Thirty years ago, the Archdiocese of Chicago started a series of lectures for young adults called Theology on Tap, which have since been given in bars and restaurants in many American cities, as well as overseas.In Pensacola, Fla., the Perdido Bay United Methodist Church has been holding weekly services at the Flora-Bama Lounge, Package and Oyster Bar since July 2011, including baptisms right in the Gulf of Mexico. Uncle Charlie’s Tavern in Cheyenne, Wyo., began holding an informal study group about a year ago called Bibles and Beer.Mr. Gilbertson’s Sunday services end just as the saloon opens at 10 a.m. He said he does not judge or mind if his congregants stick around for a drink, as some of them might do.Christine Robins, who moved to neighboring Scottsdale from Virginia in October, heard about the church while two-stepping at the Buffalo Chip, and came to like it because “it’s not pretentious, it’s not a big production, but they love the Lord just the same, which is the most important thing.”Kathleen and Abraham Abaie, who live in Cave Creek, heard about the church from a sign in the saloon’s parking lot. Cali Broermann was once in a Bible study group led by Mr. Gilbertson, and, on Sunday, while visiting from Michigan, she accompanied her parents and brother to the service.“It’s kind of cool to have it in a different setting, outside a regular church building,” Ms. Broermann said.From the start, Mr. Gilbertson said, he envisioned his venture as an opportunity to “take the church to the people.”Close to 150 people attended a Christmas Eve service, he said. On Sunday, when it was barely 50 degrees, 20 people showed up. He said he had thought about moving the service inside, as he had done in the past, arranging the chairs on the dance floor under the dim light of a neon Coors sign. But Mr. Wendt’s workers were busy setting up for a Packers game, which often brings 500 people to the saloon. (The Buffalo Chip used to be owned by Max McGee, who helped the Packers to six championship game appearances and scored the first touchdown in Super Bowl history, in 1967.)“One way to keep warm is to sing good and loud,” Mr. Gilbertson told the congregants, then strummed his guitar and began singing the first of the day’s hymns.The Abaies wore wool gloves. Ms. Broermann leaned toward the fire. Some wrapped themselves in blankets Mr. Gilbertson’s wife, Donna, had handed out.In his sermon, Mr. Gilbertson told about the killing of a member of a church where he had worked before moving to Arizona, and how detectives, looking to eliminate potential suspects, got him to take a lie-detector test. He recalled that he had begun to feel uneasy partway through it — not guilty, yet wondering if it looked as if he had done something wrong. His name was cleared. From there, he moved on to a story of guilt and persecution from the Gospel of John, about a woman accused of adultery and sentenced to be stoned to death.“If we’re very honest, we all stand condemned by our own ideals” — the loving becomes hateful, the generous becomes greedy, Mr. Gilbertson said.Like the adulterous woman whose life Jesus saved, he went on, “we are all guilty, but we are not condemned.”Mr. Gilbertson sang one more hymn and bid goodbye to his congregants, wishing them a happy New Year. As they walked away, music began to play inside the saloon, telling mamas not to let their babies grow up to be cowboys."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/sports/basketball/the-existential-crisis-of-deron-williams.html,"SAN ANTONIOIn his first meaningful act as the Nets’ interim head coach, P. J. Carlesimo sat down with Deron Williams and laid out his mission, a broad outline for leading the Nets to success.“I told him exactly what I needed him to be,” Carlesimo said Tuesday. “I needed him to be Deron Williams.”This is more complicated than it sounds.The Nets need the Deron Williams who led the Utah Jazz to the Western Conference finals in 2007, the Deron Williams who became an All-Star at 25, the Deron Williams who was, not long ago, widely regarded as one of the two best point guards on earth (along with Chris Paul).The Nets need the Deron Williams they thought they had acquired from Utah on Feb. 23, 2011, the one whose mere presence could reinvigorate a franchise, change perceptions, inspire greatness, energize a borough, start a new era.The Nets have rarely seen that Deron Williams this season, or for that matter, since he arrived 22 months ago. The Deron Williams they have seems a little lost, a little broken, a little fatigued and not quite sure of himself.If this sounds like some sort of existential crisis, it is. And it threatens to undermine everything the Nets hoped to accomplish with a $330 million roster makeover last summer.All of the team’s grand hopes begin with a presumption: that Williams is an elite point guard. At the moment, not even Williams can make that assertion.“I don’t think I’m playing like one,” he said Tuesday morning. “I think I can be. But I’ve just got to figure this thing out. Try not to panic, hopefully not talk about it too much.”With that, Williams smiled ruefully at the reporters who were asking him to talk about it, knowing full well that the questions would not recede until his game returned to form.Williams is averaging a rather ordinary 16.3 points and 7.5 assists a game this season, while shooting a career-low 39.9 percent from the field.At his peak, in 2008-9, he averaged 19.4 points and 10.7 assists while shooting 47.1 percent. He shot 45.6 percent or better in each of his last four full seasons in Utah.“I just played with more bounce there,” Williams said.No one compares Williams with Paul anymore, and he might not even make a top-10 list of point guards. As of Tuesday, he had the 20th-best player efficiency rating at his position.Williams’s struggles are not the sole reason the Nets have lost 11 of their last 16 games. They are having erratic production from Joe Johnson, their other All-Star, and a once-promising bench has faltered badly. Injuries to Brook Lopez and Gerald Wallace have disrupted their fragile chemistry.Nor was Williams the sole culprit in the Nets’ humiliating 104-73 loss to the San Antonio Spurs on Monday. He scored all 5 of their points in a record-low third quarter.Yet undeniably it is Williams who, as the point guard and the franchise star, carries the greatest burden and who has the greatest ability to reverse the Nets’ fortunes, if only he can find his game.“I’m disappointed in how I’m playing,” he said. “I’ve had stretches where one or two games I had off-games, but never like this, never consistently playing this bad.”Williams has been the first to call himself out after poor performances, admitting at various times that he has lost confidence while trying to play down various injuries that have surely affected his performance.Earlier this week, General Manager Billy King added another item to the list: the likelihood that Williams is fatigued after playing for the United States Olympic team last summer. Williams agreed, admitting that he barely took a break during the 2012 off-season. For that matter, he has had little time off since September 2011, when he began playing in Turkey during the N.B.A. lockout.In a typical off-season, Williams said he takes a one-month break. But last year, he kept training in advance of the Olympics and resumed personal workouts right after he returned from London.“I thought it was the best thing to do,” Williams said Monday, “and now looking back, it probably would have been smarter to take some time off and get a little bit of rest, especially just on my legs, my ankles in general, because they took a lot of pounding over the last year.”Williams has been dealing with a sprained right ankle and bone spurs in his left ankle, which will probably require off-season surgery.The theories on his struggles do not end there.Williams at one point cited the Nets’ isolation-heavy playbook, saying he was more comfortable with Utah’s motion offense. Ethan Sherwood Strauss of Bleacher Report last month analyzed Williams’s shooting trends and concluded that he simply is not getting in the lane for high-percentage shots as much as he once did.David Locke, the Jazz’s radio commentator, has pointed to the right wrist injury that Williams sustained in February 2011, noting that all of Williams’s statistics have declined since then. Williams had surgery on the wrist that April. He has fallen on it several times this season and ices it after every game.“I felt like I shot a lot better before my wrist surgery,” Williams conceded. “I played the last year and a half in Utah with a bad wrist. It’s one of those things where I shot a certain way for two and a half years, because of the wrist. I don’t know if it’s changed my shot or what, but my shot hasn’t felt the same since.”Having said all of that, having embraced every possible explanation for his struggles, Williams concluded, “It’s not injuries; it’s just in my head, and I’ve got to get it out.”And the existential crisis goes on."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/nyregion/weak-bolts-have-complicated-the-barclays-centers-early-days.html,"Their vision called for an edgy, urban design that would stand apart from the clamshell look of arenas elsewhere.The weathered steel panels and swooping canopy of the Barclays Center, the new home for the Brooklyn Nets, have served notice that brawny, once-industrial Brooklyn is back in the big leagues.But with innovation has also come headaches.The fabricator for the 12,000 steel panels — no two alike — abruptly shut down midway through the job.The panels have occasionally dripped rusty orange blossoms onto the sidewalk.And lately, iron workers have replaced hundreds of bolts that anchor the panels to the building’s structure. Engineers determined that weaker ones were originally installed, raising concerns about the structure’s integrity.The incorrect bolts were discovered only a month before the Barclays Center was scheduled to open on Sept. 28. The arena ultimately opened on time and it survived Hurricane Sandy’s winds a month later.After examining every joint, engineers determined that only 8 percent of the 23,351 weaker bolts needed to be replaced.But the issue has led to questions about communications between regulators and the arena’s developer, Forest City Ratner.The New York City Buildings Department said its inspectors had not been told about the problem with the bolts.“The department was not made aware of this issue,” said Anthony Sclafani, a Buildings Department spokesman. “We would expect to be notified in a case like this.”But Forest City provided a copy of a nine-page letter concerning the bolts that it said had been filed with the Buildings Department on Sept. 14. That was the day the agency issued a temporary certificate of occupancy that allowed the arena to open as scheduled.The letter, from an engineering company, outlined a plan to address the “recent discovery” that incorrect bolts had been used. It did not indicate how many bolts would be replaced, only that a “change out” had begun.Robert Sana, executive vice president for construction at Forest City Ratner, played down the problem. He said such issues were not unusual during a major construction project, particularly one with highly customized architecture. But the result was worth it, he said.“Our building is successful because it creates a proper front door for the project and a dramatic entrance that arenas generally don’t have, sitting in the middle of a suburban parking lot,” Mr. Sana said.Bruce C. Ratner, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, had offered something for everyone when in 2003 he unveiled plans for the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards development, which includes the arena.There would be a professional basketball team to salve the wound left by the departure, many decades before, of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team. The project would have lots of affordable housing, and a striking design by the architect Frank Gehry.But the recession and opposition from community groups stalled the project. In 2009, Mr. Ratner jettisoned the Gehry design, which called for a $1 billion arena, because it was too expensive.He asked a more conventional arena architect, Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers, to come up with an alternative. Later, he brought in SHoP Architects to give the building a striking facade that Mr. Ratner hoped would fulfill his original promise.“It was clear to us, coming off a Gehry design, that we couldn’t do just anything,” Mr. Sana said.SHoP wrapped the arena in three bands of pre-weathered steel to give a gritty, muscular cast, hinting at an industrial past. A swooping canopy with an oculus, or circular window, extended 80 feet from the front doors toward a new subway entrance.“This had to be a civic gesture, with the canopy and the oculus creating a public area where people would want to gather, at the mouth of mass transit,” said Christopher Sharples of SHoP. “It’s a legacy project. It’s not just about sports.”In February 2010, Hunt Construction, Forest City’s manager for the project, awarded a $32.4 million contract to ASI Limited, a steel fabricator outside Indianapolis, to produce the 12,000 panels that cover 85 percent of the facade.ASI was to put the panels through a series of wet and dry cycles over four months to create the protective rusty patina.But right before Christmas 2011, ASI defaulted on a bank loan and shut its doors.Hunt Construction was eventually able to have the fabrication plant reopened. Most of the original workers were hired to fill two 12-hour shifts a day in a race to make up for lost time.But in August, an engineering firm discovered the problem with the bolts that fastened the steel plates to the structure. The fabricator had sent five-eighths-of-an-inch bolts that were half as strong as those of that size that had been ordered.In the end, engineers determined that only 1,768 of the 23,351 bolts — about 8 percent — would need to be cut out and replaced. Workers in December were replacing the final batch, all in the canopy that extends over the entryway.As for the blossoms of metal staining the sidewalks surrounding the arena? Eventually the panels will stop rusting and workers will use power washers to remove all traces of metal from the sidewalks."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/technology/tech-giants-learning-the-ways-of-washington-brace-for-more-scrutiny.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation’s capital and overseas.In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans’ video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings.But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking.Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation — meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack — that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry’s main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that the chairman of the commission itself, Jon Leibowitz, will step down.The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration.“Now that the election is over, Silicon Valley companies each are thinking through their strategy for the second Obama administration,” said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official. “The F.T.C. will have a new Democratic chairman. A priority for tech companies will be to discern the new chair’s own priorities.”In early 2012, an unusual burst of lobbying by tech companies helped defeat antipiracy bills, which had been backed by the entertainment industry. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google feared that the bills would force them to police the Internet.At the end of the year, Silicon Valley also got its way when the Obama administration stood up against a proposed global treaty that would have given government authorities greater control over the Web.The key to the industry’s successes in 2012 was simple: it expanded its footprint in Washington just as Washington began to pay closer attention to how technology companies affect consumers. “Privacy and security became top-tier important policy issues in Washington in 2012,” said David A. Hoffman, director of security policy and global privacy officer at Intel.“Industry has realized it is important to be engaged,” he continued, “to make sure government stakeholders are fully informed and educated about the role that new technology plays and to make sure any action taken doesn’t unnecessarily burden the innovation economy while still protecting individual trust in new technology.”At the end of 2012, tech companies were on track to have spent record amounts on lobbying for the year. In the first three quarters, they spent close to $100 million, which meant that they were likely to surpass the $127 million they spent on lobbying in 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that tracks corporate spending. Even the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz hired a lobbyist in Washington: Adrian Fenty, a former mayor of the city.Technology executives and investors also made generous contributions in the 2012 presidential race, luring both President Obama and Mitt Romney to Northern California for fund-raisers and nudging them to speak out on issues like immigration overhaul and lower tax rates.In a blog post in November, the center said Silicon Valley’s lobbying expenditures have ballooned in recent years, even as spending by other industries has fallen.Facebook more than doubled its lobbying outlay in the year, reporting close to $2.6 million through the third quarter of 2012. Google spent more than any other company in the industry, doling out more than $13 million in the same period and more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft, which spent just over $5.6 million in the same period.Among Google’s advocates on Capitol Hill is a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari, who heads Google’s office in Washington.Google has particular reason to be engaged. It faces a wide-reaching antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, just as Microsoft did a decade ago. At issue is whether Google’s search engine results favor Google products over its rivals’.Although the agency was ready to settle that case before the holidays, without harsh remedies, late last month it shelved the inquiry and put stronger penalties back in play. A resolution is expected in January.The commission has already fined Google on a separate matter. In 2012, the company paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser to track users and serve them targeted advertisements.Facebook has vastly expanded its Washington presence in recent years. It has set up a political action committee, hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties and offered tips to lawmakers in an effort to make its site indispensable to politicians seeking re-election.Facebook scored a win on Capitol Hill in late 2012 when it nudged Congress to amend a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, that had protected the privacy of Americans’ video rental records. Facebook and its partner, Netflix, the video streaming service, advocated for changes in the law so that movies watched on Netflix could be shared on Facebook. That kind of data can be valuable for behavioral advertising, a principal source of revenue for Web services like Facebook.The company also attracted increased scrutiny from the F.T.C. The agency negotiated a consent order with Facebook to settle charges that it had engaged in “unfair and deceptive practices” when changes in its settings revealed personal information that Facebook users had regarded to be private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to audits of its privacy policies for 20 years.Facebook faced renewed public outcry last month when its subsidiary, Instagram, proposed to deploy users’ pictures to serve targeted advertisements. The company has backtracked on that proposal, but the outcry, say consumer privacy advocates, is an indication of public sentiment.“Yes, the industry managed to hold off privacy legislation this year,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “But if the end-of-year protests over the Facebook and Instagram changes are any indication, users will be pressing for better privacy protections in the next Congress.”Silicon Valley’s lobbying efforts are also likely to expand across the Atlantic in 2013. Both Facebook and Google have faced off with European regulators over privacy issues. Now, the European Parliament is weighing an overhaul of data protection laws that apply across the Continent.One of the proposed changes requires Web companies to ask European Union citizens for their explicit consent before collecting personal data for targeted Web advertising. Web companies vigorously oppose that and other proposals."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/dining/new-york-restaurateurs-expand-around-the-world.html,"HONG KONGAT Mario Batali’s luxe new Lupa in a gleaming tower on Queen’s Road here, soignée Chinese diners, expatriate regulars and foreign tourists glide up escalators to their tables. They navigate past a four-foot-tall bronze of Romulus and Remus in this sleek $3.2 million restaurant of glass, steel and floral terrazzo. On the menu are bucatini all’amatriciana and spaghetti alla carbonara.Eight thousand miles away, in the original Lupa in an unassuming storefront on Thompson Street in Manhattan, dressed-down customers crowd the battered tables of Mr. Batali’s thriving Roman osteria. Yes, bucatini and carbonara are on the menu.If the two restaurants’ décor, customers and locales are vastly disparate, their core menus and basic concepts are the same, as is another crucial element: the buzz and edge of New York City dining.As the economy in the United States sputters and Europe’s reels, New York restaurateurs are exporting their increasingly sought-after brands to the more robust economies of Asia and the Middle East.Mr. Batali has opened two restaurants in Singapore and two in Hong Kong, where Michael White also has an outpost of his Italian-food empire. Danny Meyer has Shake Shacks in Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar and, as of last month, Abu Dhabi. The chef Laurent Tourondel and the restaurateur Jimmy Haber own three BLT restaurants in Hong Kong and are thinking of adding more there and elsewhere.“We’ve been approached by Qatar, Korea, the Philippines,” Mr. Haber said.Other New York chefs and restaurateurs who have already set up foreign operations include Daniel Boulud, in Singapore, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, in Shanghai and Doha, Qatar. Zakary Pelaccio and Rick Camac are planning Fatty Crab restaurants in Southeast Asia. David Bouley has been approached about starting a restaurant in Beijing. Gray Kunz departed New York in 2009 to open a restaurant in Hong Kong, then stayed. David Chang said he has been sifting through transoceanic inquiries about planting his flag in Asia and the Middle East.“In the culinary world, New York is the creative incubator and has some of the best-known restaurants on the planet,” said Sandeep Sekhri, who invited Mr. Batali, Mr. White and Mr. Tourondel to Hong Kong and now manages their restaurants. “Here, it is easier to market someone from New York — they have name recognition.”Despite complicated feelings about the United States in the Middle East, “New York City is a very strong brand in its own right,” said Hilary Baker, a vice president of M.H. Alshaya Company in Kuwait, which has opened the Shake Shacks there and in Dubai. “And it has a hip urban cachet that helps to define Shake Shack.”Even the devastation that Hurricane Sandy wreaked on many New York restaurants does not appear to have dampened the owners’ ardor to proliferate, or the city’s image overseas.“New York’s restaurant brand wasn’t affected,” Mr. Sekhri said, “because although the hurricane was widely reported in our media, there wasn’t much coverage locally of what restaurants had to go through.”There are economic hurdles, like the frightfully expensive real estate in Hong Kong and some Middle Eastern locations. But considerable profits — 13 to 15 percent a year, as compared to an average 10 percent or so in New York — are possible, Mr. Camac said after a recent Asian trip to scout locations for his Fatty restaurants. At the BLT steakhouse and burger places in Hong Kong, Mr. Haber said revenues have risen each year by more than 5 percent.In the quest for faraway gold, though, restaurateurs must navigate a host of potential pitfalls, including menu mistranslations, cultural embarrassments, difficulties in finding ingredients and staff, and aggressive copycatting.Foreign partners like Mr. Sekhri are necessary because “you can’t just plunk down an exact copy of the original,” said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a New York restaurant consulting company that bears his name. “You need to comprehend the exact dynamics of the local market, or you will come aground awfully quick.”Menus require a difficult balancing act, he added.“You need to offer that core of items that are your brand, although you might have to change the flavors,” he said. “You just have to adapt to the culture.”Mr. Sekhri, whose company, Dining Concepts, owns or manages 21 restaurants and has $65 million in yearly revenues, described Hong Kong, with its history as an English colony, as the gateway to Asia and the Chinese market. As Joseph Bastianich, Mr. Batali’s partner, put it, “It’s an easier way to get your feet wet.”But there is still a problem with salt.“You think that Chinese food is very salty,” Mr. Bastianich said, “but we learned we had to tone down the salt a whole lot, so as not to have a lot of acidity in the food, because they don’t like that.”Mr. Tourondel discovered that he had to offer a lunch buffet “because Hong Kong people like to eat buffet style,” he said. And it turns out that many women here prefer their tap water warm.One evening in the Hong Kong Lupa — when, mistakenly, sanitary hats were not delivered for the kitchen staff — Zach Allen, the restaurant’s executive chef, asked workers to wrap table napkins around their heads like bandannas, as they would in an American kitchen.“But they refused to do it, and I was getting upset,” Mr. Allen recalled. “So I asked my Chinese sous chef why, and he said, ‘You wear a white bandanna on your head only when you are mourning the death of a loved one.’ Boy, did I feel stupid.”Sharp lessons like these were learned decades ago by American fast-food chains and snack-food companies. A mistranslation of KFC’s “finger-lickin’ good” slogan into Chinese characters urged consumers to “eat your fingers off,” before the company fixed it and went on to success in China. In Russia, Lay’s potato chips fell flat until the company added a fishy “crab flavor.”Brands can be tweaked for foreign consumption, but only up to a point.“The perception in Hong Kong about Mario was that he was upscale, but we started Lupa as a family-style trattoria,” Mr. Sekhri said. “So we made it more Babbo.”Mr. Bastianich explained that “in a brand-new, $300 million building, the Hong Kong Lupa couldn’t be as rustic as New York’s. But it must still offer our menu of authentic Italian food and wine.”In Kuwait, the Shake Shack menu posed a quandary.“Bacon won’t fly, nor any pork,” said David Swinghamer, the company’s chief development officer. But his team found a beef-based bacon in Europe “that has a smoky flavor and high quality.”Cultural challenges do not stop many of these restaurateurs, however.“We plan to open at least another six Shake Shacks over the next 12 months,” said Ms. Baker of the Alshaya company, which operates more than 20 restaurant brands in the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Eastern Europe, including Le Pain Quotidien, Starbucks, Dean & DeLuca and the Cheesecake Factory.Locating authentic menu ingredients can be a concern abroad, though not in Hong Kong.“You can get it all here,” said Mr. Allen, the Lupa chef.But even in Hong Kong, replicating the New York experience isn’t easy. Mr. Tourondel said he made the 16-hour flight here from New York to “taste more than 50 different formulations of prime Black Angus” to design an Asian BLT burger similar to the American original.There is also a 12-hour time difference between New York and Hong Kong.“Early morning and late evening conference calls certainly elongate the workday,” said Mr. Swinghamer of Shake Shack. “We try not to interfere with family and personal time.”Distance can also provide a useful buffer in partnership disputes or disasters. Mr. Tourondel created his Hong Kong restaurants with Mr. Haber, but after they broke up their American operations in March 2010, the Chinese restaurants were jointly owned by the two through Mr. Sekhri’s company. And they will continue to share management, despite the settlement of their ugly legal struggle in November.Mr. Sekhri said he first approached Mr. Haber and Mr. Tourondel in 2009 about locating in Hong Kong, after local developers told him “it would add to the value of their real estate if I brought in the right brand names.” He then approached Mr. White and his partner Ahmass Fakahany — both of whom declined to be interviewed for this article — and in May 2011, their 180-seat Al Molo opened here, with an average dinner check of $70.In many of these deals, the loose network that has developed among New York chefs offered a sounding board.“Sandeep was chasing us, but I didn’t return his phone calls for two years,” Mr. Bastianich said. “Finally I got on the phone with him and he was here the next day — wow! So I checked him out with Michael White, and he said thumbs up.”Still, New York chefs haven’t welcomed every foreign manifestation of their brands. Tom Colicchio, whose holdings in the United States include two Craftsteaks, was surprised a few years ago to find out that Mr. Sekhri had named his own Hong Kong restaurant Craftsteak.“The guy never called me,” he said of Mr. Sekhri. “I never had a conversation with him.”Mr. Sekhri denies knowing about Mr. Colicchio’s restaurants when he chose the name. Their restaurants “are different,” he said, adding that “we are supported by the trademark and intellectual property laws in Hong Kong. If you register the name, you own that brand, under Hong Kong law.”Mr. Colicchio said, “We called our trademark people, and they said we’d spend a lot of money but we weren’t going to get anywhere.”Yet surprisingly, Mr. Colicchio was conciliatory. Mr. Sekhri is “by all accounts good at what he does,” he said. “I’m not bitter, and I wouldn’t be against working with him” on a future project."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/sports/ncaafootball/stanford-holds-off-wisconsin-in-rose-bowl.html,"PASADENA, Calif. — The view was still a sight to behold, the same as it has been for 99 years: the sun setting on the San Gabriel Mountains in the distance as the Rose Bowl champion was about to be decided. But this year’s meeting devolved into something familiar for Barry Alvarez: brawn, bruises and punts. A lot of punts.Alvarez’s 16 seasons as Wisconsin’s coach, a College Football Hall of Fame induction, a previously perfect 3-0 Rose Bowl record, his vintage red sweater vest and timeless sunglasses did not count for much on Tuesday. Not against Stanford, a program that flexed its staying power, slowly wearing out the Badgers, 20-14.After Stanford’s first Rose Bowl win since 1972 and Wisconsin’s third Rose Bowl loss in three years, the grass was worn, marked with fresh divots, and the ground was lumpy, somewhat like Play-Doh. For Stanford (12-2), at least, it had been fun.“We do what we do, man,” said Cardinal linebacker Shayne Skov, eye black smeared on his face.“We play defense, we run the ball, we blitz, we tackle, we play physical, we run the ball,” he said, repeating himself. “When we do it the right way, and we communicate and don’t make mistakes, it looks great.”Yet Stanford, ranked eighth, jumped to a 14-0 lead by taking chances. Wisconsin (8-6) trailed, 17-14, at halftime. By the second half, fatigue set in, and a tug of war ensued between each team’s star running back, Wisconsin’s Montee Ball and Stanford’s Stepfan Taylor.At first, though, the game was thrilling. Sensing Wisconsin would be overzealous, Stanford ran what Coach David Shaw considered “razzle-dazzle” plays, a double-reverse wide receiver pass for 34 yards on its first drive, and a 43-yard play-action pass to tight end Zach Ertz on its second drive. Both drives ended in touchdowns. The excitement mostly ended there.Ball, the N.C.A.A. record-holder for career touchdowns (83), broke free for an 11-yard touchdown, and Wisconsin quarterback Curt Phillips ignited another touchdown drive with a 38-yard scamper, but the Badgers moved the ball slower than the Cardinal, just like Alvarez’s teams of old.Wisconsin seniors had pleaded for Alvarez, the athletic director, to step in for Bret Bielema, who had left for Arkansas, to coach them in the Rose Bowl. Alvarez hired Utah State Coach Gary Andersen but decided to take Bielema’s place for the bowl game. Six assistants who will move on to new jobs stayed to assist Alvarez.Even with Bielema gone, there had been hope.“Winning this game would’ve erased everything, all the bad stuff that happened to us this season, but we fell short,” Ball said afterward, shaking his head.Ball did his part, rushing for 100 yards on 24 carries. His counterpart, Taylor, had 88 yards and a touchdown and was named the offensive player of the game.Back and forth he and Taylor went in the second half, disappearing in a mosh pit of red and white bodies, out of sight to gain their yards. Not many came in the third quarter, when there were three total first downs and seven punts between the two teams.“I come from a high school where we ran the spread offense and it was just deep ball, deep ball, deep ball — that’s boring to me,” said Stanford’s fifth-year senior center, Sam Schwartzstein. Referring to the Cardinal’s former star quarterback, he continued: “You can ask Andrew Luck. He thinks that’s boring too. This is real football, grindstone. That’s how it’s supposed to be played.”Stanford quarterback Kevin Hogan had done “just enough,” on those first two drives, said Stanford’s offensive coordinator, Pep Hamilton. He handed the ball off 27 times — 20 to Taylor — and threw just 19 passes for 123 yards. It was Hogan’s 54 rushing yards that were crucial, Shaw said, in a game where yards were scarce.Finally, in the fourth quarter, Hogan led a grueling 11-play, 51-yard drive that ended in a 22-yard field goal, padding Stanford’s lead as darkness fell.Already, some of the Rose Bowl’s shine had faded. Pundits, and surely conventional wisdom, thought Wisconsin somewhat unworthy of a Rose Bowl berth, having lost five games this season. Because Penn State and Ohio State were ineligible, Wisconsin played in the Big Ten championship and whipped Nebraska, 70-31.So this Rose Bowl was billed as brawn versus brawn. The opponents looked and played the same. Hamilton had remarked that he considered his offensive linemen “playmakers.” And Alvarez warned: “Better bring your big-boy pads.”Wisconsin was within a touchdown, driving near midfield, when Phillips’s pass was tipped and intercepted by Usua Amanam with 2 minutes 3 seconds left.The struggle had ended, and the San Gabriel Mountains were no longer visible in the night."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/sports/football/bills-oilers-game-in-1993-is-greatest-comeback-that-ever-was-and-was-not.html,"It seemed like a logical decision at the time. It was a cold, windy day at Rich Stadium in suburban Buffalo in 1993, and the hometown Bills were behind, 35-3, in the second half of a first-round playoff game against the Houston Oilers. With the outcome seemingly no longer in question and the weather rather uninviting, many fans simply chose to go home.The score was not the lone reason for pessimism. The Bills were playing without Jim Kelly, their franchise quarterback; linebacker Cornelius Bennett, the N.F.L.’s defensive player of the year; and running back Thurman Thomas, the offensive player of the year, who injured his hip early in the third quarter. And the Oilers had crushed Buffalo, 27-3, the week before.“I almost never, ever, ever give up, but at that point, I kind of did give up,” said Barb Beebe, who was at the game and is the mother of Don Beebe, then a receiver for Buffalo.But just as it looked as if all hope was lost, the Bills proceeded to mount the largest comeback in N.F.L. history, a victory that two decades later — Thursday will mark the game’s 20th anniversary — still resonates in western New York.Some of the fans who left early did not realize until much later that the Bills came back to win. Others heard it unfold on the radio. The game did not sell out, so it was not televised locally. The Bills did not allow fans who left the game to re-enter the stadium. The only way for those who left to get back into the stadium was to climb over an imposing fence. Many did just that until late into the game, when the team began to allow fans with ticket stubs back in the stadium.Frank Reich, who was filling in for Kelly, said that when the Bills were facing the seemingly insurmountable deficit, a teammate reminded him that when Reich was in college, he led Maryland back from 31 points down to beat Miami.“I knew it could be done, but I don’t think anyone was thinking about winning the game at that point,” Reich said recently. “It was about being a professional and not getting embarrassed.”The improbable comeback was propelled by two botched kicks, a shanked punt, a bobbled snap and a noncall by the officials. A short kickoff set up a 50-yard scoring drive by Buffalo that cut the lead to 35-10. Then Bills kicker Steve Christie recovered his own kickoff — Marv Levy, then Buffalo’s coach, still insists the play was a flub and not a planned onside kick.Three plays later, Beebe caught a 38-yard touchdown pass on first down to make it 35-17. Replays show that he stepped out of bounds before making the catch. Barb Beebe, who insists her son never stepped out of bounds, said that was the point when she regained hope. Cris Dishman, who was a cornerback for Houston, still says the noncall cost the Oilers the game.“Why didn’t someone think of instant replay sooner?” he said. “Then that greatest comeback never would have happened.”Reich threw three touchdown passes in seven minutes against the N.F.L.’s third-best pass defense to cut the deficit to 35-31. He then threw another touchdown pass to Andre Reed for the third time to give Buffalo a 38-35 lead.The Oilers soon had a chance to tie, but holder Greg Montgomery bobbled the snap to botch a 31-yard field-goal attempt. Warren Moon drove the Oilers to the Bills’ 9 in the waning moments of regulation, and Houston kicked a field goal with 12 seconds left to send the game to overtime.The Oilers got the ball first, but Nate Odomes picked off Moon’s pass at Houston’s 37, leading to a Christie field goal that gave the Bills a 41-38 win.The Bills poured onto the field in celebration, and the fans who stayed — or returned — hugged and kissed one another, cried tears of joy and sang “Shout,” the team’s theme song, for the seventh and final time in the game.At the postgame news conference, Reich recited lyrics to a Christian song that he said inspired him before taking questions.Dishman was more direct.“It was the biggest choke in history,” he told reporters. “Everyone on the team, everyone in the organization choked today.”Dishman, now an assistant secondary coach with the San Diego Chargers, has not changed his opinion. “I stick with that statement because that’s what happened,” he said recently. “We didn’t finish the game.”Dishman said that the Oilers lost the game more than the Bills won it, but one of his former teammates, Don Maggs, an offensive lineman who is now an analyst at Progressive Insurance, did not agree. “The Bills earned it,” he said, refusing to cite bad calls or bad luck for the loss.In Buffalo and elsewhere around the country, the game came to be known as “The Comeback,” but in Houston, it is still referred to as “The Choke.”The Oilers fired the defensive coordinator Jim Eddy and the defensive backs coach Pat Thomas the day after the game, and a local radio station held a funeral for the team, complete with coffins and servers from Hooters as pallbearers.Bills fans were convinced that the team’s luck had changed, but after road victories against the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Miami Dolphins, they were routed by the Dallas Cowboys, 52-17, in Super Bowl XXVII and again the next year.The Oilers, who made the playoffs seven years in a row, started the next season 1-4 but won 11 straight before losing in the first round of the playoffs for the fourth time in five years.The franchise moved to Tennessee in 1997, and Rich Lord, a longtime host at Sports Radio 610 in Houston, said he believed that “The Choke” — along with other Oilers playoff failures — paved the way for the team’s departure. Lord said that the Oilers’ playoff collapses lingered in the city’s collective psyche, and that even now, Texans fans expected their team to come up short at this time of year.Two years after the Oilers moved, the franchises again met in the playoffs. This time, the Bills were the hard-luck losers, going down to the Tennessee Titans on a disputed kickoff lateral play in the final seconds of a game now called the Music City Miracle. The Bills have not been back to the playoffs since.The Bills’ comeback was voted the fifth-most memorable game in league history in an NFL Films poll in 2000, and ESPN in 2004 rated it the third-biggest collapse in sports history.Maggs, who said he hoped another team would break the comeback record, also acknowledged it was a game for the ages.“They came back from 32 points down with Kelly out,” he said. “You have to admit, it’s one of the greatest games in history — for the Bills, but not for us.”Steve Tasker, a standout special-teams player for the Bills who is now an analyst for CBS, called “The Comeback” part of the heritage of western New York, a game that proved once and for all that leaving early was never a good idea. “It was the ultimate it’s-not-over-till-it’s-over cliché,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/sports/ncaafootball/late-quarterback-switch-pays-off-for-south-carolina.html,"Steve Spurrier’s plan to use two quarterbacks in the Outback Bowl worked so well that Dylan Thompson and Connor Shaw earned game balls.Shaw began the Gamecocks’ 33-28 victory over Michigan in Tampa, Fla., with a 56-yard touchdown pass to Damiere Byrd. Thompson finished it with a 32-yard scoring strike to Bruce Ellington in the final minute to help South Carolina (11-2) match the program record for victories in a season.“I don’t know if I’ve ever given two quarterbacks a game ball, but today I said, ‘Hey, we’ve got to give them to both you guys,’ ” Spurrier said.“There’s no jealousy, nothing,” he added. “Those guys are just really, really good teammates. We tried to tell Connor, ‘It’s your game.’ And it was his game, but Dylan was going to play. He understood that. It worked beautifully, as it turned out.”Thompson replaced Shaw during the winning drive, covering the final 43 yards after Shaw began the march from his 30 and kept it alive with a 6-yard completion to Ace Sanders on a fourth-and-3 play. Devin Gardner’s third touchdown pass had given Michigan a 28-27 lead.Shaw threw for 227 yards and 2 touchdowns, Thompson for 117 yards and 2 scores.Gardner threw for 214 yards in his fifth start for Michigan (8-5) since Denard Robinson injured his right elbow late in the season. Robinson took some snaps at quarterback but lined up mostly at running back and rushed for 100 yards on 23 carries. He set an N.C.A.A. record for career yards rushing by a quarterback, raising his four-year total to 4,495 — 15 more than West Virginia’s Pat White from 2005 to 2008.“I’d rather win the game,” said Robinson.South Carolina defensive end Jadeveon Clowney, the Southeastern Conference defensive player of the year, was quiet for much of the day. But he shifted momentum in the fourth quarter with a big hit on running back Vincent Smith, causing a fumble that Clowney recovered to set up Shaw’s touchdown pass to Sanders for a 27-22 lead.FLORIDA STATE 31, N. ILLINOIS 10 Florida State stuffed the Northern Illinois all-purpose threat Jordan Lynch for most of the night in Miami in the Orange Bowl.The senior fullback Lonnie Pryor, voted the game’s outstanding player, ran for a career-high 134 yards and 2 scores in only five carries for Florida State. The senior E J Manuel threw for 291 yards.The victory was a consolation prize for the No. 13 Seminoles (12-2), who began the season with national championship hopes.Northern Illinois busted into the Bowl Championship Series on the strength of a 12-game winning streak, becoming the first team from the Mid-American Conference to play in one of college football’s biggest bowl games.But even the Huskies acknowledged before kickoff that Florida State was unlike any opponent they’ve faced this season, and the Seminoles wasted little time showing that might be right.Pryor had a career-long 60-yard touchdown run to open the scoring for Florida State; Pryor’s run was more than twice as long as any other rushing play allowed by Northern Illinois this season.GEORGIA 45, NEBRASKA 31 Aaron Murray set a Georgia bowl record with five touchdown passes, including two in the fourth quarter, against the nation’s top-ranked passing defense as the sixth-ranked Bulldogs beat No. 23 Nebraska in the Capital One Bowl in Orlando, Fla.Murray shook off two first-half interceptions, including one returned for a touchdown, and passed for 427 yards, also a Bulldogs bowl record. He was named the game’s most valuable player.“I don’t know what it’s like to head into an off-season with a win,” Murray said. “It’s a great feeling to get a win. It’s great for the seniors, who have meant so much to this team. They’ve done a great job of leading this team the whole season.“To get 12 wins, that’s something special.”Georgia (12-2) reached 12 wins for the third time, and Nebraska (10-4) lost its third straight bowl game. The Cornhuskers finished the season with two straight woeful defensive performances, having lost the Big Ten championship game to Wisconsin, 70-31.The Cornhuskers led, 24-23, at halftime but committed two of their three turnovers in the final 30 minutes.Nebraska Coach Bo Pelini said the efficiency of Murray and Georgia on third down (12 for 17) was too much to overcome.“I thought the plan was good,” Pelini said of his team’s defense. “Third down hurt us, obviously. When we were in position, it was man on man down the field. We needed to make some of those plays and we didn’t.”NORTHWESTERN 34, MISS. ST. 20 The stuffed monkey spent the last year in storage, out of sight but still on everyone’s mind.Coach Pat Fitzgerald dusted it off for the Gator Bowl in Jacksonville, Fla., and even had it on the sideline as a reminder of Northwestern’s bowl losing streak — the monkey on their backs.Now it’s in pieces.Behind interceptions early and late, No. 21 Northwestern beat Mississippi State and snapped college football’s longest postseason losing streak. The Wildcats (10-3) hadn’t won a bowl game since 1949, a nine-game skid that was tied with Notre Dame’s for the longest in N.C.A.A. history.As a reward, Fitzgerald let his players rip the monkey to shreds in the locker room.“We’ve never been here before, but now we’re here and here to stay with a new streak you can talk about in a positive fashion,” Fitzgerald said.Quentin Williams returned an interception 29 yards for a touchdown on the third play of the game, and Nick Vanhoose set up a late touchdown with a 39-yard interception return. Those plays were the difference in a game that featured more interceptions (seven) than touchdowns (six).Northwestern’s two-quarterback system kept the Bulldogs (8-5) off balance. Kain Colter ran for 71 yards, making up for his two interceptions. The backup Trevor Siemian threw for 120 yards and an interception, and also ran for a score.OKLAHOMA ST. 58, PURDUE 14 Clint Chelf threw three of Oklahoma State’s five touchdown passes, and the Cowboys shook off a poor Big 12 finish by rolling up 524 yards and forcing 5 turnovers in a lopsided victory in the Heart of Dallas Bowl.Oklahoma State Coach Mike Gundy did not hide the disappointment of sliding down the bowl list with an overtime loss to Oklahoma — the Sooners scored in the final seconds of regulation — and a narrow defeat at Baylor to end the regular season.The Cowboys (8-5), a year after completing their best season ever with a win in the Fiesta Bowl, posted their biggest bowl win since Gundy was the quarterback in a 62-14 rout of Wyoming in the 1988 Holiday Bowl.“Some of the seniors, those guys, would like to have been in a better bowl,” said Chelf, who was 17 of 22 for 197 yards with no interceptions at Cotton Bowl Stadium. “We’re a highly motivated group. I think everybody wanted to go out there and prove people wrong.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/sports/baseball/sam-khalifa-briefly-a-rising-star-forever-a-mourning-son.html,"TUCSON — It was called the Masjid of Tucson, a mosque where Muslims could worship and study the Koran in the Arizona desert under the idiosyncratic tutelage of Rashad Khalifa, its founder. On Jan. 31, 1990, the mosque, at the intersection of Sixth and North Euclid, near the University of Arizona campus, became the scene of a murder investigation.Khalifa was found near the kitchen that morning, stabbed to death. It appeared to investigators that whoever had killed him had also tried to set fire to the body in an effort to destroy evidence.A Ph.D.-educated Egyptian-American, Khalifa had founded his masjid as part of a midlife revelation that he was a messenger of God. In practice and study, Khalifa’s teachings about the Koran were infused with science, modernity and, more than anything, numerology. The number 19, he taught, was “the miracle’s common denominator,” a code that unlocked the Koran, like a secure password.Much of Islam teaches that the Prophet Muhammad was the last messenger of God, but Khalifa added himself to the list, getting his message out through books, videos and a newsletter called Muslim Perspective.His scholarship was curious to some and blasphemy to others. He began to receive threats against his life. Once he had been killed, conspiracy theories quickly circulated about who might have been responsible. Tucson investigators eventually came to focus on a local person of interest whose trail they soon lost.It was not until 2006, when grant money from the Justice Department helped jump-start the city’s backlog of cold-case homicide investigations, that new DNA tests of bloodstains from the crime scene led to the arrest of a man named Glen Francis, who was then living in Canada.As opening arguments in Francis’s murder trial began on Dec. 11 in Pima County Superior Court here, Sam Khalifa, the son of the victim, sat in the mostly empty gallery. He is 49 now and drives a cab here. But at one time, he was the starting shortstop for the Pittsburgh Pirates.Despite his middle-age paunch and the fatigue he wears on his face, Khalifa still resembles the handsome, dark-featured 22-year-old on his 1986 baseball card. In the mid-1980s, Khalifa was the rare Muslim baseball player and, according to Major League Baseball, the very first son of an Egyptian to play in the big leagues. His boyhood narrative included a year spent playing on a makeshift sand field in Tripoli, Libya.The Arab world back story lent some flavor to his steady development from the minors to the major leagues. The Pirates drafted him in the first round in 1982 out of Tucson’s Sahuaro High School. By 1985, with Pittsburgh going through a series of shortstops, Khalifa replaced the injured Johnnie LeMaster in the starting lineup.In the end, Khalifa played parts of three seasons in Pittsburgh, but by the 1989 season, he found himself being moved around the infield at the Pirates’ Class AAA affiliate in Buffalo, plagued by the sense that the organization had given up hope that he would ever be its everyday shortstop.One night during a trip, Khalifa missed a team bus and simply flew home. Five months later, his father was killed, upending his life further and dashing whatever thoughts he had of spring training with another team.“I know Cal Ripken lost his father one year and he later joined his team, which is respectable, but it wasn’t for me,” Khalifa said during one of several recent conversations. “I think it would have been hard for me to focus on the game.”It was also hard for Khalifa to focus on his father’s murder, yet he could not help it. Over the next two decades, as the murder investigation went cold, Khalifa got a college degree, drove a cab, tried some sales jobs, tried to get over his anger. Then he went back to driving a cab.The night before the trial, Khalifa stood beside his taxi. He did not much seem to relish revisiting his playing days, good or bad, or whatever feelings are still attached to them. He tended to describe his abilities by playing them down. Nor did he welcome any newfound attention on those years now that the trial was finally happening.At one point, he said his big-league career should have lasted 5 or 10 years. It was one of the rare times the dreams of his athletic past broke through.A Childhood on the MoveOne day last month, Khalifa parked his taxi in the courthouse garage and arrived just as jury selection had taken a pause for lunch. In the hall, he spoke briefly with his mother and younger sister, who had been there from the start of proceedings that morning. Khalifa was wearing tan pants, a loosefitting short-sleeve black shirt and a windbreaker.He can, if prompted, still conjure his baseball promise.“You were asking me if I was fast,” Khalifa said at lunch that day. “I was quick, and my range was sufficient to make all the plays.”He admired the agility and enthusiasm with which Ozzie Smith, a Hall of Fame shortstop, played the position.“I watched him make plays against us that were just like you watch on the highlight reel,” Khalifa said. “I made a couple of those, you know — in the minors, and maybe even a handful in the big leagues.”And then, to state the obvious, he added, “But Ozzie did it quite frequently.”Khalifa laughed a little. One year in the minors, he broke his arm twice, just above his wrist, but he said he otherwise had no nagging injuries. His knees are good. After a pastrami sandwich and French fries, he looked at a dessert menu that featured more than 20 flavors of ice cream and chose salted caramel.Khalifa was born in Fontana, Calif., while his father was working on a Ph.D. in plant sciences at the University of California, Riverside. During his youth, the Khalifas twice relocated to the Middle East as his father took on a series of jobs as a specialist in agricultural or horticultural science.When he was little, Sam said, the family moved to Alexandria, Egypt, when his father had a position doing research for the Ministry of Agriculture, the first of many stops in a childhood of relocations and intermittent athletic progress.Sam was 12 when the hopscotching family moved for a year to Tripoli. There, Sam’s father worked as an agricultural consultant to the government of Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi.Sam recalled a few details about life in Libya in the 1970s. He remembered attending a local mosque with his father, attending the Oil Companies School, and playing baseball on a sand field with the children of Americans employed by oil companies.“They’d spray it with water, and then roll it with a steamroller,” he said of how the sand was fabricated into an infield. “Like a Zamboni type of thing.”Khalifa’s American mother grew up in Tucson, and that was where the family ultimately settled when Sam was entering high school. At Sahuaro High School, football was his fall sport; in the spring, he played baseball for a local coaching legend, Hal Eustice.On the Pima County Sports Hall of Fame Web site, the local organization lists Khalifa’s high school accomplishments: named all-city quarterback by The Arizona Daily Star in 1982, the same year he played shortstop on a state-title-winning baseball team; selected No. 7 over all in the major league draft, the highest ever for an Arizona scholastic player; signed a letter of intent to play baseball at Arizona State but turned professional instead.The Pirates gave him a $100,000 signing bonus, Khalifa said. Death ThreatsRashad Khalifa, 54 when he was killed, had first come to the United States and earned a master of science degree in horticulture at the University of Arizona in 1962, and later a Ph.D. in plant sciences at U.C. Riverside. Three decades on, with his son working his way to the big leagues, Rashad Khalifa, according to Sam, was working for the State of Arizona in Mesa.A car accident during his commute one day contributed to his father’s decision to devote himself full time to his masjid, to Islamic teaching and study. Years before, while Rashad Khalifa was working for Monsanto in St. Louis, his faith had brought into his life a prominent pro football player named Bobby Moore, then one of the few African-Americans on the N.F.L.’s St. Louis Cardinals. The player changed his name to Ahmad Rashad.Sam said his father was always a big supporter of his baseball career, especially when he hit the big time with the Pirates.“It’s been a great thing, thank God, to watch him grow and see this,” Rashad Khalifa said in a 1986 article published in a magazine called Saudi Aramco World, named for the Arabian American Oil Company.The Aramco World article noted that Pirates broadcasters had called Sam the Cairo Kid, even if neither he nor his father actually hailed from there.Rashad Khalifa, growing ever more serious about his faith and his scholarship, even cut Sam slack about his fealty to Islam. Not that he ever lost his own ordering of what mattered most.“He wanted it to be the most important thing for me, more important than baseball,” Khalifa said of his faith. “He was all about making sure that in your mind and in your soul you knew what your priorities were, and that was to make sure that God was the most important thing in your life.”When Khalifa began publishing books, one of his first, published under the name Islamic Productions, was called “The Computer Speaks: God’s Message to the World.”The computer, Khalifa believed, was a latter-day “creature made of earthly materials” through which the Koran was broken down mathematically, and God’s true message, the miracle of 19, was revealed.In the appendix of his translation “Quran: The Final Testament,” Khalifa described how in the 1970s, he wrote the Koran into the computer and discovered what he saw as the purified word of God revealed through a mathematical system, correcting the distortions of prior English translations.“I used a time-share terminal, connected by telephone to a giant computer,” he wrote. He had removed two verses from the Koran for not conforming to the pattern.In a 1988 video sermon, Rashad Khalifa seems not so much a firebrand as a balding professor lecturing with authority and occasional humor on his new job as messenger of God, a calling that he said he had “chickened out” of announcing previously. Even though his father is often referred to in articles as an imam or cleric, Sam Khalifa is not comfortable with those terms and all that they can imply these days.“Rashad didn’t interpret the Koran” but just stated facts that were uncomfortable to much of the Muslim world, he said, including that worship of the Prophet Muhammad alongside God is a form of idolatry.The threats against Rashad Khalifa’s life came soon enough. His sister later said that his worry grew so great that he feared he was under surveillance while he was bent in prayer.In 1989, the Tucson police told Rashad Khalifa that an F.B.I. raid of a storage unit in Colorado had revealed evidence of a possible plot against him by an American-based Islamic sect called Al Fuqra. The group was said to be founded by Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, the cleric whom, years later, The Wall Street Journal’s Daniel Pearl was seeking to interview in Pakistan when Pearl was kidnapped and killed.Sam Khalifa, struggling to keep his major league dreams alive, knew of the controversy and fear back home.“My father, he was responsible for his own actions, and I am, too,” Sam Khalifa said. “I was playing baseball, he was doing what he was doing. Naturally, I was concerned for him, but I wasn’t going to be able to stop what he wanted to do.” Playing With the Pirates“Pirates Promote Worldly Shortstop,” read the headline in The Chicago Tribune when the 21-year-old Khalifa was called up in June 1985 from Class AAA Hawaii of the Pacific Coast League.The article noted that Khalifa got six hits in his first 11 at-bats in the big leagues, even though he was considered more of a fielder than a hitter.“He’s got quickness, and in the game of baseball, he’s very intelligent,” Chuck Tanner, then the manager of the Pirates, said of Khalifa at the time. “He’s come by leaps and bounds because of his desire and his ability to learn. He’s going to be a good, solid major league shortstop.”Khalifa’s rookie year was his best with the Pirates. He hit .238, including 14 doubles, over 95 games. But he also encountered something relatively unfamiliar to him: slumps. And the Pirates were having a miserable season, mired in the cellar of the National League East.The organization was well beyond the feel-good “We Are Family” 1979 World Series team of Willie Stargell and Omar Moreno and not yet the divisional dynasty with the dream outfield of Barry Bonds, Bobby Bonilla and Andy Van Slyke. Pittsburgh lost 104 games in Khalifa’s rookie year. The team was up for sale, and current and former players were being called to testify before a grand jury looking into a cocaine ring in the clubhouse.Khalifa “played adequately but the team was struggling big-time, so it was hard for any rookie to show everything he could do,” said Steve Demeter, a first-base coach for the Pirates in 1985.After the season, Tanner was fired, and Jim Leyland was given his first big-league managerial job. Leyland, now the manager of the American League champion Detroit Tigers, recalled that he had Khalifa platooning at shortstop in 1986 with Rafael Belliard.“Sammy was the more overall talented guy; they thought he was going to hit,” Leyland said in a recent interview. Like others who readily recall Khalifa, Leyland called him “a good kid” before suggesting his problems were more mental than physical.“I wasn’t really sure that he was into it as much as you need to be to maybe max out your ability,” Leyland said.Bonds joined the team (Khalifa recalls he was skinnier back then). So, too, did Bonilla, who had been Khalifa’s roommate when the two played in Class A ball. But Khalifa was on his way out of baseball.That season with the Pirates, Khalifa hit another slump, and his batting average withered to .185. He was sent back to the minors — to Honolulu, to Vancouver, to Harrisburg and to his last stop, Buffalo. The Bisons had a promising shortstop, Jay Bell, who eventually nailed down the job in Pittsburgh.Bell, the current hitting instructor for the Pirates, recalled that Khalifa was hard on himself.“That was one of the things that I remember about Sammy, was the fact that there was no separation of the game at the park or away from the park,” Bell said. “It was more about constantly grinding over what had happened during the game, good or bad, instead of just walking away from it and separating.”The last straw for Khalifa came one night during a road trip. He remembered that he called the team trainer to say he would be on the team bus in five minutes. The Bisons, then managed by Terry Collins, now the manager of the Mets, left him behind anyway, he said.Khalifa flew home to Tucson instead of catching up with the team, and the Pirates suspended him. In an item in The Sporting News at the time, Khalifa told a reporter: “I had a lot of different feelings. I was frustrated, so I decided to come home.” Chuck LaMar, the minor league director for the Pirates, summed up Khalifa as “basically confused.”“He’s so confused about what he wants to do that I think he’ll be out all year,” LaMar said at the time.Back home, his father encouraged him not to give up, Khalifa said, and it seemed he would not. Joe L. Brown, the former general manager of the Pirates who guided the team to World Series championships in the 1960s and 1970s, tried to arrange a spring training tryout with the San Diego Padres, Khalifa said.But then his father was murdered in the middle of a January night — a time when Rashad Khalifa liked to work in peace and quiet — and Sam never made it to a Padres tryout.The Murder TrialSome 23 years after Rashad Khalifa’s death, the Pima County Attorney’s Office had a murder case to prosecute. Three years after the case was reopened, the authorities arrested Glen Francis in Calgary, Alberta. Francis fought extradition for two years, but ultimately went on trial here last month.Not much is known about Francis. Sean Bruner, of the Pima County Public Defender’s Office, cast his client as somebody who moved around to pick up the odd job, a native of Trinidad and Tobago who came to Tucson in 1990 to work illegally. Bruner suggested Francis was an unlikely suspect for a murder that might have been driven by religious zealotry.Francis appeared to have lived in the area under an alias, according to the judge’s pretrial factual findings in the case. And he was at least once picked up by federal authorities, who took care to take a DNA sample. Ultimately, with the local cold case squad revived, that DNA sample was matched to blood evidence taken from the murder scene in 1990.The question of whether people had been out to kill Khalifa for religious reasons had taken interesting turns over the intervening years. Two men arrested as a result of the F.B.I.’s 1989 raid of the reputed Al Fuqra storage unit in Colorado were ultimately convicted of conspiring to kill Khalifa. It was even believed by law enforcement that one of the people involved in tracking Khalifa was Wadih el-Hage, who is serving life in prison for his role in the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Africa.But prosecutors, all these years later, have made little effort trying to determine or prove Francis’s possible motive, beyond some long-ago statements Francis might have made about Khalifa’s teachings and murder. Whether he was acting on the orders of others has not been raised. The case they put on last month was almost strictly driven by the DNA evidence.“They had all these big names and big-time people wanting to kill this guy, and there’s no motive for this guy, there’s no history for this guy, there’s no nothing,” Bruner said of Francis.During opening arguments, Sam Khalifa sat with his sister while their mother watched from a chair at the back of the room. He and his family had waited a long time for justice.In the end, the trial moved quickly, and the verdict was returned briskly. Glen Francis was found guilty of Rashad Khalifa’s murder.Back to WorkSam Khalifa bought his parents’ old house years ago and now rents it out. He has recently done some football and baseball coaching at his alma mater, Sahuaro High School. It’s about all the exercise he gets, he said with an implied shrug.In public, he has a habit of looking behind him. Sometimes, it’s just a glance; other times, he turns his body. Asked about it, Khalifa smiled shyly and speculated that it had something to do with years spent in a cab. He leases the cab and can make his own hours, and he generally drives between 6 a.m. and 5 p.m., he said. He’s fluent in Tucson’s many Mexican restaurants.He admitted to watching this year’s World Series between the Tigers and the Giants.“Exciting,” he said.But his major league life seemed pretty well buried.After court one day during the trial, Khalifa fished from the trunk of his cab one of his father’s writings, “Quran, The Final Testament.” It was getting to be evening. Khalifa was going back to work.The masjid, now a piece of rental property at a busy intersection, still has the words “Happiness Is Submission to God” painted on the side, visible as you drive past on North Euclid Avenue. The property is now in a family trust. In the course of his work, Sam Khalifa — once a Muslim baseball curiosity, ever so briefly a shining prospect, long the mourning son of a murdered father — drives by it all the time."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/sports/governor-tom-corbett-to-sue-ncaa-over-penn-state-sanctions.html,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Gov. Tom Corbett said Tuesday that he planned to sue the N.C.A.A. in federal court over sanctions imposed against Penn State in the wake of the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse scandal.Corbett, a Republican, scheduled a news conference for Wednesday on Penn State’s campus in State College to announce the filing in United States District Court in Harrisburg.The sanctions, agreed to by the university in July, included a $60 million fine that would be used nationally to finance child abuse prevention grants.State and federal lawmakers have raised objections to the money’s being spent outside Pennsylvania.The N.C.A.A. did not respond to a message seeking comment on the expected lawsuit.Last month, a Pennsylvania congressman said he was unhappy with how the N.C.A.A. responded to a request from the state’s House delegation that the entire $60 million in Penn State fines be distributed to causes within the state.Mark Emmert, the president of the N.C.A.A., had said in a Dec. 12 letter that a task force had been charged with allocating at least 25 percent of the fine money to programs in Pennsylvania."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/ncaafootball/for-notre-dames-brian-kelly-grand-valley-remains-near.html,"Before Brian Kelly restored the luster to Notre Dame, he coached the Lakers. These were not the Los Angeles Lakers; more like the complete opposite. These were the Grand Valley State Lakers, a Division II football team in Allendale, Mich.This was not a brief stopover for Kelly, a steppingstone on the usual itinerant career path, a place to spend a year or two and beef up the old résumé while keeping one eye cocked toward somewhere better. Kelly built the foundation of his career at Grand Valley.There, he became a coach.He arrived in 1987 as a graduate assistant, a bachelor and glorified gofer who pocketed $4,000 annually the first two years and $12,000 after that. He left for Central Michigan after the 2003 season with 118 victories and 2 national championships, with a family and a system he believed in, a system he knew would work at the highest level. Even at Notre Dame.At Grand Valley, Kelly met and married his wife, Paqui. They used to run together at lunchtime (she set the pace). They had three children there. He became a defensive coordinator and a head coach, both for the first time. He learned how to recruit, adapt, ignore those who clamored for his job. He also learned a special class of players could transform a program, long before it happened again this season at Notre Dame.His former players and assistants and support staff have watched Kelly on television. They saw the undefeated regular season that will culminate in the Bowl Championship Series national title game against Alabama on Monday.They see the familiar beet-red face, the temper, the wrath, the familiar schemes and tendencies.Mostly, they see their coach, in charge of perhaps the nation’s most storied program, so much changed and yet so little different.“He was born and bred at Grand Valley State, small town, Division II,” said Curt Anes, the quarterback who helped Kelly change it all. “He might be at Notre Dame now, but I’ll tell you something: he hasn’t changed a bit.”Well, he has changed some. The Kelly who drove his Ford Escort through the cornfields was younger, slimmer and poorer than this version.He fit in well immediately at Grand Valley. Staffers described the young Kelly as intense, a climber, but not so much that he overstepped. They noticed his intelligence, confidence and charisma. They insist they knew he would do big things, great things. But Notre Dame? Head coach? Undefeated?Of course they did not expect that.“I needed to learn how to be a head coach,” Kelly said in a phone interview. “Everybody wants to be one, but Grand Valley provided me on-the-job training. It prepared me for everything that came after.”It’s almost surreal now how all the dots connect. How Tom Beck, the man who hired Kelly, left to join Lou Holtz at Notre Dame in 1991. How three candidates emerged as potential successors to Beck. How Kelly beat them out for the job at 28.In his second game in charge, Kelly’s Lakers played at North Dakota State, the undefeated defending national champion, winner of an obscene number of consecutive home games. Grand Valley could not afford a hotel and flew in the day of the game. Yet when the Lakers recorded an upset, Don Thomas, the former longtime sports information director, remembered that Kelly just stood there, alone and dumbfounded.Grand Valley made the playoffs in 1991 and again in 1994, losing its first game each time. In 1996, an athletic director named Tim Selgo arrived from Toledo, where he had worked with another promising young coach — Nick Saban, now at Alabama, Kelly’s counterpart in the national title game.Selgo asked Kelly to a Detroit Tigers game. He insisted they drive together, some five hours there and back. Kelly reminded Selgo of Saban, and while Selgo could not remember the score of the game, he could recall the impression Kelly made.“One thing about Brian, why he’s a perfect fit for Notre Dame, is he appreciates and understands the total picture,” Selgo said. “He knows how to build a program. I could see it at Grand Valley. I can sense it at Notre Dame.”Kelly returned to the playoffs in 1998, where he again lost his opener. The grumbling started soon after: Kelly could not win the big game, not even a single playoff victory.That was before the recruiting class of 1998, the class that altered Kelly’s career path. It started Grand Valley on its way to becoming a Division II athletic juggernaut, and, it could be argued, helped rescue Notre Dame from football mediocrity because of the events it set in motion.“What happened in the years to come was mind-boggling,” said Tim Nott, an associate athletic director with Grand Valley since 1997.Kelly found Anes in a wing-T high school offense that hid his considerable talents. The day before Kelly showed up at Anes’s high school unannounced, Anes turned down the coach at Ferris State, Grand Valley’s rival. “Thanks but no thanks, Coach,” Anes said. “I’m not playing Division II.”Then Kelly showed up, and Anes told his friends: “Here’s another D-II guy. I’m going to lay him down softly.”Anes sat down with Kelly in an office inside the locker room. Kelly laid out his vision, what he called The Plan, how Anes would travel to Grand Valley State in two days for an official visit, commit that weekend, come to school, break every Grand Valley passing record and lead the Lakers to a national title.“It was almost like he prophesied over me,” Anes said.Anes was but one important component of The Plan. Kelly filled that class with players as good as any in Division II. There was David Kircus, the receiver who scored 76 career touchdowns. And there were the Hosford twins, the defensive lineman Dan and the offensive lineman Tom, the offspring of Jamie Hosford, the greatest athlete in Grand Valley State history. The Hosford boys, Kelly said, provided the backbone of those teams. They pointed their praise back at him.“We sat in the locker room as freshmen talking about playing for the national championship, before we even realized we could do it,” Dan Hosford said. “Brian was the guy behind that. He believed in us before we even did.”Much of that class redshirted in 1998, then stumbled to a 5-5 record in 1999, a season that was among the worst in Grand Valley State history. Selgo pushed for a contract extension for Kelly, because he believed in the coach and the class of ’98.After the final game, Anes told a local columnist it was “just a matter of time” before the Lakers competed for a national championship. Kelly summoned Anes to his office, looked at Anes and smiled.“O.K., let’s do it,” he said.The next season, the Lakers started 1-4 but won their final six games. Kelly, as he would show later at Central Michigan, Cincinnati and Notre Dame, was adaptable. He visited Northwestern and Oklahoma State, and he borrowed from their offensive philosophies to install a spread system of his own. He built around the talent that existed.The 2001 team ran a no-huddle offense that averaged more than 600 yards and 58.6 points. Nott had to start keeping statistical averages by quarter, since most of the starters rarely played in the second half.In the first round of the playoffs, Anes tore every ligament in his knee, when his leg stuck in the field and twisted so far around that he said his hamstring hit the ground before his calf did; the calf muscle ripped off the bone. The following week, Kelly installed a wishbone offense, and the Lakers still advanced to the championship game, which they lost.Kelly and the Lakers went undefeated in 2002. Grand Valley claimed 11 all-American slots that year, many from that ’98 recruiting class. Anes won the Harlon Hill Trophy, the top honor in Division II.“There were so many similarities between that class and my senior class now at Notre Dame,” Kelly said. “Took some lumps along the way. Went through some adversity. But you could see it coming. You could feel it.”Kelly would adapt again the next season and win another championship, this time with defense. He left for Central Michigan for the 2004 campaign, and after three seasons there moved to Cincinnati. The system he constructed would produce two more championships at Grand Valley State under Chuck Martin, now Kelly’s assistant at Notre Dame.This success would bleed into other sports. The 2002 title marked the university’s first ever, in any sport. Now, Grand Valley has won 14 championships. Admissions rose. So did overall interest.“If Brian didn’t recruit those guys, if he didn’t have that success, he might not have gotten out of Grand Valley,” Nott said. “He might not have gone to Central Michigan. He might not be at Notre Dame.”Except all that did happen. Kelly did recruit, did build this Notre Dame championship contender with defense and another special class, albeit one that he inherited. Grand Valley State had taught him to mold the system to the talent.“He always reminded me of Bill Clinton,” Selgo said. “Like the way he made people feel in his presence. The way everyone felt like they were a part of something.”A few years back, Grand Valley State inducted Kelly into its Hall of Fame. He thanked more than a dozen people in his acceptance speech, and without a single note jotted down. He spoke about how the university prepared and changed and made him. He donated money for a sports center and mentioned the university in news conferences. He designed his Kelly Cares Foundation on lessons he learned there, and every event he held reminded him of where it all had started.He still stumped for Grand Valley, long after he left. Once a Laker, always a Laker.Showtime is where Brian Kelly made it."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/football/packers-mission-make-adrian-peterson-look-mortal.html,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — The tape was painful to watch. There was Adrian Peterson, strong and powerful, running through Green Bay’s defensive line, over linebackers, and past the secondary again and again during the Vikings’ 37-34 win Sunday. There he was, stiff-arming Brad Jones on one play, slipping the tackle of a blitzing Morgan Burnett on another, dragging M. D. Jennings into the end zone on a touchdown run.“Sure, it’s tough to watch,” linebacker Dezman Moses said. “But it’s learning tape, and we learned from it.”When the Packers host the Vikings on Saturday night in the wild-card round of the N.F.C. playoffs, the Green Bay defense will try to do something that it, and the rest of the league, did not do during the regular season: make Peterson look human.After tearing an anterior cruciate ligament in December 2011, Peterson ran for 2,097 yards this season, 8 short of Eric Dickerson’s N.F.L. record. While becoming the seventh player to exceed 2,000 yards rushing in a season, he did more damage against the Packers than any other team. Peterson ran for 210 yards in a Week 13 loss at Lambeau Field, and for 199 yards on a career-high 34 carries in Week 17, helping to secure a playoff berth for the Vikings while depriving the Packers of a first-round bye.“He’s got vision; he’s got power; he could shake you,” Packers defensive lineman C. J. Wilson said. “There’s not a lot of weakness there.”With only six days to recover and rededicate themselves to limiting the N.F.L.’s best running back, the Packers have preached run defense at practice.“Most of their offense comes through A. P.,” Wilson said. “He’s pretty much their whole team.”The lesson learned, several defensive players said, was discipline: manning their gaps, trusting their teammates and sticking to their assignments should help keep Peterson from the second and third levels of the defense.“We need to play a little smarter in regards to scheme,” linebacker Clay Matthews said. “Not in terms of the plays we call, but as far as where we fit.”Defensive lineman Ryan Pickett added: “We got caught peeking into each other’s gaps. When you do that, Adrian will make you pay.”Also important, linebacker Dezman Moses said, was not just how many yards Peterson gained, but when he got them. In the teams’ first meeting, the Packers won, 23-14.“He had the numbers, but a lot of those yards were meaningless,” Moses said. He also said the quick turnaround could be an advantage for the Packers, allowing them to watch film and make adjustments immediately.Green Bay’s defense will get a much-needed lift from Charles Woodson, the eight-time Pro Bowl safety, who will return after missing nine games because of a broken collarbone sustained in October.Woodson practiced fully Wednesday. His presence gives the Packers a veteran leader and a proven run-stopper in the secondary.“He’s a dynamic player,” Coach Mike McCarthy said. “Talk about versatility and the ability to make plays. He’s tough around the line of scrimmage.”Burnett added, “It’s like a having another coach on the field.”Despite Peterson’s performances against Green Bay’s defense, the unit ranked 11th in fewest points allowed. It includes many of the key players from the Packers’ Super Bowl-winning team two seasons ago.The offense, led by Aaron Rodgers, has rounded into form since a 38-10 loss to the Giants in Week 12. The unit averaged 32 points per game over the final five weeks of the season, and if the defense can match that performance, Moses said, the Packers will be a force in the playoffs.“We want to do what we can do, so Aaron can do what he can do,” he said.Rodgers and his arsenal of playmakers can help Green Bay’s defense by scoring early and often, forcing the Vikings to throw the ball. That did not happen in Week 17. Minnesota jumped out to a 13-0 lead, and Green Bay never led. A balanced Vikings offense Saturday is something the Packers’ defense would welcome.“We want him in the mix,” Matthews said of Minnesota quarterback Christian Ponder. “If we limit those carries and force Ponder to beat us, that’s the game plan we want.”Peterson, though, promised a heavy dose of himself.“We’re going to establish the run, starting with the guys up front,” he said Wednesday.Matthews had a guarantee of his own.“We ain’t giving up 200 yards again,” he said. “We’ll be better.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/football/ray-lewis-ferocious-face-of-ravens-and-nfl-is-retiring.html,"Next football season, Ray Lewis will be on the sideline, perhaps saving up his pregame speeches — motivational, to be sure, but sometimes indecipherable in their ferocity — for his son’s first season at the University of Miami.It is almost impossible to imagine the N.F.L. without Lewis, without the eyeblack streaked across his face, without his wild dances as he emerged from the stadium tunnel, without his punishing hits.In truth, Lewis’s play has been ebbing for a few years, his ability to run sideline to sideline slowed by age, his intimidating tackles weakened by the loss of weight he shed to try to regain some speed. Even when he tore his triceps this season and missed the final 10 games of the regular season, it was clear that the Baltimore Ravens more desperately missed a teammate, linebacker Terrell Suggs, who was out part of the season with an Achilles’ tear.But when Lewis announced Wednesday that he would retire after this season — the Ravens play the Indianapolis Colts in a wild-card game Sunday — it felt like the end of an era, one that Lewis dominated as the greatest linebacker of his generation and perhaps the greatest middle linebacker in N.F.L. history. He said it was “time to create a new legacy.”“I talked to my team today,” Lewis said to reporters. “I talked to them about life in general. And everything that starts has an end. For me, today, I told my team that this will be my last ride.”Lewis will play Sunday for the first time since he tore his triceps in mid-October. Because the Ravens are the fourth seed, the game is likely to be his last one in Baltimore, the city where he has spent his entire N.F.L. career.Lewis joined the team in 1996 as a first-round draft pick — though not the first linebacker taken that year — out of Miami, the same year the Ravens started playing in Baltimore after Art Modell moved the franchise from Cleveland.Lewis brought immediate attention and relevance to the Ravens. In 2000, a year after he was indicted on murder charges after a fight broke out at a Super Bowl party — he later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and served no time in prison — Lewis was the league’s defensive player of the year for the first of two times and the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, which the Ravens won.Lewis also crafted a defensive legacy that still defines and shapes the perception of the team. In 2000, Baltimore gave up the fewest points in a 16-game season, allowing it to overcome a five-game stretch in which the offense did not score a touchdown. In 12 of his 17 seasons, the defense finished the season ranked in the top 10.“I thought, shoot, the guy could play forever and would play forever,” said Colts Coach Chuck Pagano, who was the Ravens’ defensive coordinator last year. “Great person, great man, great player, just an unbelievable human being — what he’s done for that organization, that city and, for that matter, so many people. He’s obviously a first-ballot Hall of Famer and will be sorely missed.”If the timing of Lewis’s announcement was a surprise, the substance was not. He has hinted that his career was nearing its end and that he wanted to be home to see his son, Ray III, play in the fall at Miami.“God is calling,” Lewis said. “My children have made the ultimate sacrifice for their father for 17 years. I don’t want to see them do that no more. I’ve done what I wanted to do in this business, and now it’s my turn to give them something back.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/hockey/nhl-union-lockout-negotiations.html,"Negotiations to end the N.H.L. lockout faced a tipping point Wednesday, as the players’ association made another offer and negotiated with the league while the union’s executive board considered whether to dissolve by a self-imposed midnight deadline.The deadline passed — an indication that the union chose to continue talks.The union membership voted last month to authorize the leadership to disclaim interest, but only until midnight Wednesday. A disclaimer of interest would effectively dissolve the union and allow individual players to file antitrust suits against the N.H.L. for continuing the lockout, which reached its 110th day.The union’s latest offer was the fourth exchanged by the two sides since Dec. 27, when the N.H.L. extended a proposal that jump-started the current round of talks.“All I’ve said, and all I will say, is that the players retain all their options, and it’s an internal matter,” Donald Fehr, the union’s executive director, said Wednesday afternoon.Even if the union declined to disclaim interest, the leadership could still do so at a later date, but only if the rank and file authorized it in another vote.The pension issue could hold up a quick resolution to the lockout, which Commissioner Gary Bettman has said he wants settled by Jan. 11 so a 48-game schedule could begin no later than Jan. 19.The union has proposed that players finance the pension plan, but owners would be responsible for covering any potential shortfalls that might arise. The owners appeared to be balking at assuming that risk.“The way it works is the players are still funding the pension,” Los Angeles Kings forward Kevin Westgarth, a member of the negotiating committee, said in an interview last month. “The only issue is if there is a possible underfunding at some point — owners don’t want that on their books.”Last month, Westgarth said an improved pension plan was the players’ biggest gain in the negotiations.“I think the fact that we sold it as extremely important to players may have worked against us,” he said, citing the owners’ reluctance to bail out the pension fund in case of a shortfall.Under the collective bargaining agreement that expired in September, 75 percent of the players’ pension fund was financed by the owners and 25 percent by the players.Negotiators are haggling over the salary cap for the 2013-14 season, which the owners wanted to drop from $70.2 million to $60 million, while the players sought a cap closer to $67 million."

The Rays announced it on Wednesday.A hard-throwing left-hander, Price became the franchise’s first 20-game winner in 2012, going 20-5 with an A.L.-best 2.56 earned run average and 205 strikeouts in 211 innings.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/football/nfl-roundup.html,"The Jets will hold their season-ending news conference with Coach Rex Ryan and their owner, Woody Johnson, on Tuesday — nine days after the end of their season.Much has happened since Ryan last spoke, on Sunday after a 28-9 defeat at Buffalo that secured a 6-10 record for a team that spoke of 16-0 perfection. The Jets fired their general manager, Mike Tannenbaum, but have maintained silence about the status of their embattled offensive coordinator, Tony Sparano. Also continuing is the search for Tannenbaum’s replacement, who will inherit both a coach and a quarterback, Mark Sanchez, he might not want but will probably have little choice but to retain.The Jets have been lampooned for demonstrating a lack of accountability since Tannenbaum’s dismissal. The revelation that Ryan is recharging for a few days in the Bahamas has only fed that perception.Only players available in a one-hour period of locker-room access Monday could speak to the chaos surrounding the team. Many did, with running back Joe McKnight saying, “It kind of messed with us a little bit.”By delaying Ryan’s and Johnson’s availability until Tuesday, the Jets are violating N.F.L. policy, which requires every team to conduct a news conference during the week after the season “with its head coach, and/or owner, and/or club president and/or general manager” to “respond to fan interest.” None of the other 19 teams that failed to make the playoffs violated the policy, according to the N.F.L. spokesman Greg Aiello, who said the league was investigating the matter.THE CARDINALS’ SEARCH The Arizona Cardinals have completed an extensive interview that spread over two days with their defensive coordinator, Ray Horton, in the search for a replacement for the team’s fired coach, Ken Whisenhunt.Next up is Andy Reid, the longtime Philadelphia Eagles coach, who was among seven N.F.L. head coaches who were fired on Monday. Reid’s interview, while not formally scheduled, could come on Thursday.Michael Bidwill, the Cardinals’ president, has identified Horton, Reid and Mike McCoy, the Denver Broncos’ offensive coordinator, as candidates to replace Whisenhunt, who was dismissed after six seasons. The Cardinals plan to interview McCoy in Denver this weekend.  (AP)COORDINATOR SIGNS CONTRACT Atlanta Falcons Coach Mike Smith said that Dirk Koetter, the team’s offensive coordinator, had signed a contract extension to stay with the franchise through next season.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/hockey/nhl-union-lockout.html,"Hopes for a prompt settlement in the 110-day old N.H.L. lockout were scuttled Thursday when players began voting to reauthorize Donald Fehr, the union’s executive director, to disclaim interest in representing the union.If Fehr disclaims, it would effectively dissolve the union and open the way for players to file antitrust lawsuits against the league. The result of the vote is expected to be announced Saturday.“The players retain all the legal options they have always had,” said Fehr, who did not meet with Commissioner Gary Bettman at Thursday’s sessions.The threat of a disclaimer loomed over five hours of negotiations Wednesday, until a midnight deadline passed, a signal that talks would continue.The union filed a motion Thursday in United States District Court in New York, seeking dismissal of an N.H.L. filing on Dec. 14 that said any union disclaimer of interest would be unlawful.“The N.H.L. is using this suit in an attempt to force the players to remain in a union,” the memorandum said. “Not only is it virtually unheard of for an employer to insist on the unionization of its employees, it is also directly contradicted by the rights guaranteed to employees under Section 7 of the National Labor Relations Act.”Judge Paul A. Engelmayer scheduled a hearing for Monday.“The Court is mindful of the broader context in which this lawsuit has been filed: ongoing negotiations between the National Hockey League and its players which, if not resolved in short order, may imperil the remainder of the N.H.L. season,” Engelmayer wrote.The two sides brought in a federal mediator, Scot L. Beckenbaugh, this week, raising hopes that a settlement was possible by Jan. 11, which would allow a 48-game schedule to start by Jan. 19.The two sides were expected to reconvene Friday. “The mediation process continues,"" said Gary Meagher, an N.H.L. spokesman."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/the-many-sides-of-ray-lewis-leading-off.html,"When Ray Lewis announced his impending retirement from the Baltimore Ravens on Wednesday, it fell neatly in line with the dichotomy that has been Lewis’s entire career. Was his idea to do this before the Ravens’ first playoff game an invaluable emotional boost to his teammates, or a look-at-me moment at a team-focused time? Was Lewis merely the game’s greatest middle linebacker, or the kind of head-wrecking force that necessitated the N.F.L.'s making the game safer, a campaign, fittingly, Lewis has put his face to? Was he a great statesman, or the shady guy the N.F.L. once fined a substantial sum for his involvement in a murder?The answer to all of those questions, and more like them, is yes. Lewis could be all of those things at once. And if you have trouble figuring out what to feel about him, you may also likely struggle with how to feel about the N.F.L., with its not-always-easy combination of violence and character, of mayhem and integrity. Lording over it all for 17 seasons was Lewis, alternately wearing a menacing scowl or a Cheshire cat grin.He was, undoubtedly, one of the greatest defensive players of all time, as Mike Preston argues in The Baltimore Sun, one who used speed to revolutionize his position, writes Mike Freeman on CBSSports.com. But he was, and is, complicated, as Ashley Fox writes on ESPN.com, with his plea deal in a 2000 murder case remaining a stain on his character record, one he has assiduously worked to rehabilitate. And yes, even though he is now text message buddies with the current commissioner, Roger Goodell, as Jason Cole writes on Yahoo.com, he also symbolizes every part of the N.F.L. spectrum, the admirable parts and the parts we would probably rather know less about.He did guarantee you’ll hear about him endlessly this weekend — which is why The Baltimore Sun’s Peter Schmuck, among others, called the timing questionable — overtaking the usual blather about the head coaching carousel and the latest exploits of Robert Griffin III. (But it is still worth dropping in on RGIII’s drop-in at Redskins Coach Mike Shanahan’s news conference this week, just for laughs.)The college football scene got a jolt of the unexpected on Wednesday night, too, with Louisville, a 14-point underdog, upending Florida in the Sugar Bowl, giving Coach Charlie Strong reason to celebrate his decision to spurn a job offer from Tennessee to stay at the program he built, as Edward Aschoff writes on ESPN.com. As Andy Staples writes on SI.com, this kind of effort is what that loyalty bought from his Louisville players, who made a bit of a mockery of that betting line, Tim Sullivan writes in The Louisville Courier-Journal.It sure beat contemplating the other college football news of the day, that being Gov. Tom Corbett’s announcement of an antitrust lawsuit against the N.C.A.A. for its sanctions against Penn State for its failures in the Jerry Sandusky child sexual abuse case. But while almost anyone can root for a real challenge to the N.C.A.A. and its loose moral grasp of the mess it oversees, this one was hard to rally around, what with Corbett doing several about-faces in this whole process, as Gene Collier writes in The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, and the fact that it is badly disguised political grandstanding designed to pander to Penn State fans and voters, as Greg Couch writes on Foxsports.com. That might be enough, as Dan Wetzel writes on Yahoo.com, to make even the N.C.A.A. look sympathetic here.It’s just another case of not being sure what to root for. There’s a lot of that going around.Follow Leading Off on Twitter: twitter.com/zinsernyt"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/hockey/nhl-union-lockout-negotiations.html,"Negotiations to end the N.H.L. lockout passed a critical point Wednesday, as the players’ association negotiated with the league deep into the night. At the same time, the union’s executive board allowed a self-imposed deadline for dissolving the union to pass, assuring that talks will continue without the immediate threat of lawsuits.The union membership voted last month to authorize the leadership to disclaim interest, but only until midnight Wednesday. A disclaimer of interest would have effectively dissolved the union and allowed individual players to file antitrust suits against the N.H.L. for continuing the lockout.But midnight passed with no indication that the union had notified the league of a disclaimer. That suggested that the rancor and bitterness that marked the first three and a half months of the lockout had finally gone, replaced by earnest bargaining.A federal mediator was present for the long day’s talks, according to Donald Fehr, the union’s executive director, and the N.H.L.’s commissioner, Gary Bettman -- further evidence that the negotiations have reached a constructive stage.Bettman said the mediator, Scott Beckenbaugh of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, requested that the two sides resume talks at 10 a.m. Thursday.“The players retain all the legal options they have always had, and I don’t talk about any internal matters,” Fehr said cryptically when asked whether the union had notified the league of a disclaimer.He spoke at 1 a.m. Thursday, after the end of almost five hours of talks at the league office in Midtown Manhattan.However, the N.H.L.’s Bettman, speaking a few minutes later, was more direct.“The word ‘disclaimer’ has yet to be uttered to us by the players’ association,” Bettman said. “When you disclaim interest as a union, you notify the other side. We have not been notified, and, as I said, it has never been discussed. So there has been no disclaimer.”But the long bargaining session and the banishment of a disclaimer threat did not necessarily mean that a settlement was close. The players’ pension fund was among several issues standing in the way of a quick resolution to the lockout, which Bettman has said he wants settled by Jan. 11 so a 48-game schedule can begin no later than Jan. 19.Fehr’s negotiating team included more than a dozen players as talks continued for a seventh straight day. Bettman’s team contained no owners, as it has throughout this latest round of bargaining. The presence of some owners in previous sessions had been seen as incendiary, particularly the participation of Jeremy Jacobs, the hard-line Bruins owner and chairman of the N.H.L. Board of Governors.The union presented its latest proposal at around 3 p.m., during a one-hour meeting with the league. It was the fourth offer exchanged between the two sides since Dec. 27, when the N.H.L. extended a proposal that jump-started the current round of bargaining.After league officials weighed the offer, the union returned for more talks at 8 p.m.Bettman said the presence of a mediator was jointly requested by the league and the union.“Can’t hurt,” Bettman said when asked why a mediator was requested.Bettman said the two sides “made some progress but were still apart on some issues” but added that he was “hopeful” as long as talks were continuing.“On some issues we agreed, on some we moved toward each other, and on some we said no,” Bettman said. “I think that applies to both sides.”Fehr was similarly guarded, adding that differences remain on some core economic issues.“The parties moved closer together on some issues, but there is still a ways to go, if an agreement can be reached,” Fehr said.Neither Fehr nor Bettman would discuss specific areas under negotiation, but Bettman called pensions a “complicated issue” that was “still a work in progress.”The union has proposed that players finance the pension plan, but owners would be responsible for covering any potential shortfalls that might arise. The owners appeared to be balking at assuming that risk.“The way it works is the players are still funding the pension,” the Los Angeles Kings forward Kevin Westgarth, a member of the negotiating committee, said in an interview last month. “The only issue is if there is a possible underfunding at some point — owners don’t want that on their books.”Last month, Westgarth said an improved pension plan was the players’ biggest gain in the negotiations.“I think the fact that we sold it as extremely important to players may have worked against us,” he said, citing the owners’ reluctance to bail out the pension fund in case of a shortfall.Negotiators also haggled over the salary cap for the 2013-14 season, which the owners wanted to drop from $70.2 million to $60 million while the players sought a cap closer to $67 million. Also under negotiation were limits on escrow payments made by players in case revenues drop sharply, the length of the collective bargaining agreement and other issues.Thursday marked the 110th day of the lockout."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/football/lambeau-field-is-next-test-for-vikings-rookie-kicker.html,"EDEN PRAIRIE, Minn. — The first day the kicking instructor Nick Gancitano worked with a skinny teenager named Blair Walsh on a high school field near Walsh’s home in Boca Raton, Fla., Gancitano noticed something that set the young prospect apart from others.It was not Walsh’s strong right leg. It was his attention span.“Blair maintained eye contact with me when I was speaking with him,” Gancitano said in a telephone interview this week. “At that age, that’s not an easy thing to do. It’s easy to get distracted.”To Gancitano, who kicked at Penn State from 1981 to 1984, it revealed Walsh had two of the traits imperative for kicking success: concentration and humility. Walsh wanted to be good and to learn.“If you think you already know,” Gancitano said, “the mind won’t be open when the truth does come out.”Still, even Gancitano could not have predicted Walsh’s rookie season for the Minnesota Vikings. One year after a baffling senior slump at Georgia hurt his draft standing, Walsh led the N.F.L. with 35 field goals this season, on 38 attempts. He converted 10 from 50 yards or more, a league record, without a miss.His two game-winning field goals provided bookends to a 141-point season. He punctuated his N.F.L. debut on Sept. 9 against Jacksonville with a 38-yard winner in overtime, after hitting a 55-yarder as time expired in regulation. That kick was the longest by an N.F.L. rookie in a season opener.Last Sunday his 29-yarder on the game’s final play beat Green Bay, 37-34, to put the Vikings in the playoffs. Walsh actually made that one twice; the first did not count because Packers Coach Mike McCarthy called a timeout before the play in an attempt to rattle him.“He’s beyond his years as a rookie, which is incredible,” said Cullen Loeffler, the Vikings’ veteran long snapper. “It’s hard to break into this league the way that he has. He didn’t just break in. He broke through. It’s been amazing what he’s done, and it’s been a lot of fun.”A rematch with the Packers in an N.F.C. wild-card game at Lambeau Field on Saturday night offers a fresh challenge for Walsh’s focus and nerve. He has never kicked outdoors in a game in which the temperature fell below 40 degrees. The Saturday forecast for Green Bay, Wis., according to accuweather.com, calls for a high of 26 with a low of 18.Two of the three field goals Walsh missed this season came outdoors on grass. Julius Peppers blocked a 30-yard try in Chicago on Nov. 25, which Walsh said had a low trajectory. The next week at Lambeau, Walsh pushed a 42-yarder to the right. The Vikings lost both games, though the 23-14 defeat at Green Bay irritated Walsh more.“I want to go in there and have a good showing,” Walsh said. “I remember leaving that stadium dejected from the fact that we lost, and the fact that I missed my only attempt. So I’m definitely motivated to go back in there and have a successful game this time.”Vikings Coach Leslie Frazier’s decision to practice this week inside the field house at Winter Park, even with the heat off and the doors open, limited Walsh’s exposure to the swirling winds and uncertain footing he may face Saturday. The field house has newly installed artificial turf. Walsh said he would monitor the wind Saturday in the time-honored way, repeatedly tossing up handfuls of grass.“You’ve just got to prepare to know that you’re going to be cold and you’re going to be uncomfortable, and then put it out of your mind once the game starts,” Walsh said. “You can’t be sitting there thinking about how cold it is and how miserable your body feels. You’ve got to make sure you’re staying warm, staying loose and ready to go at any point.”The 22-year-old Walsh is a Viking because the special teams coach Mike Priefer recommended the team release the reliable veteran Ryan Longwell after last season and bring in someone with a stronger leg for kickoffs. Among regular kickers, Longwell’s 19 touchbacks in 2011 ranked him near the bottom of the league. Only Atlanta and San Diego allowed more kickoff return yards than Minnesota.Priefer and the special teams assistant coach Chris White worked out collegians and veterans before settling on Walsh, a sixth-round pick who missed 14 field goals as a senior at Georgia after going a combined 40 of 45 in his sophomore and junior seasons. Priefer felt Walsh was rushing, and a minor fix to his footwork and tempo solved the problem.“We slowed him down to an incredibly slow time, and had him build back up from there,” Priefer said. “It didn’t take long. By the end of the spring, he was almost game-ready. That’s a tribute to him, his hard work and his understanding of his craft.”The big season by Walsh contrasted with the lengthy slump of Green Bay’s Mason Crosby, who missed 12 of 24 field-goal attempts from Oct. 7 to Dec. 16. McCarthy stuck with Crosby, who righted himself by going 4 of 4 the last two weeks. Walsh’s long-distance accuracy surprised Crosby, who converted only 2 of 9 attempts from 50 yards or longer, the second a 51-yarder on Sunday.“I didn’t realize he had so many kicks from over 50 yards,” Crosby said. “That’s impressive for anyone, rookie or not.“This will be a test coming to Lambeau in the playoffs with the wind and the cold. It can be tricky, but he’s handled everything so well this year.”Even with a little stubble on his face, Walsh, who is listed at 5 feet 10 inches, hardly gives off the aura of a grizzled football player. Needing a caffeine boost before Sunday’s game, Walsh, still in street clothes, walked up to the Metrodome concourse and bought a Diet Coke from a vendor for $5. He said no one recognized him.“I blend in pretty easily,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/football/nfl-roundup.html,"San Francisco 49ers kicker David Akers said Thursday he received death threats on Twitter and closed the account. He received the threats last month, but was unsure at the number because he did not go further back on his account to count.Once he saw them, he reported it to team and N.F.L. security personnel. The 49ers said they were aware of the situation, as was the league. Akers has been in a slump compared with 2011, when he made 44 of 52 field goals. This season he is 29 for 42.PLAYER IN CRASH WAS SOBER An autopsy has found that Dallas Cowboys practice squad player Jerry Brown Jr. was sober when he was killed in a crash that led to an intoxication manslaughter charge against the teammate at the wheel.The Dallas County medical examiner’s office reported that Brown died of head and neck trauma when their vehicle overturned. He had a blood alcohol content of 0.056 percent. That is below the Texas drunken driving standard of 0.08 percent.The police have said Cowboys nose guard Josh Brent, who was driving, had a blood alcohol level twice the legal limit.ARIANS TO TALK WITH BEARS The Colts’ offensive coordinator, Bruce Arians, has been given permission to interview with the Chicago Bears for their head-coaching job.

They dismissed Bill Hughan, the head strength and conditioning coach, who oversaw a program that drew scrutiny during off-season workouts and training camp for what the team perceived as a high number of soft-tissue injuries, particularly among its receivers.Those injuries ultimately forced Coach Rex Ryan to amend the training-camp schedule to account for additional stretching. Hughan replaced Sal Alosi, who resigned after tripping the Dolphins’ Nolan Carroll during a punt return, before the 2011 season. BEN SHPIGEL"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/ncaafootball/notre-dames-team-clown-finds-his-serious-side.html,"SOUTH BEND, Ind. — The camera panned across the lush, green, Irish landscape, when a voice came from off-screen.“They said they have mooses out here,” the voice said.That excited Louis Nix III, the Notre Dame nose guard known as Irish Chocolate, who was the cameraman and star of a YouTube series titled “Chocolate News.”“I’ll go pet a moose,” he said in response. “I feel like they have a moose petting zoo out here — that’s how nice it is. I don’t know who would like to go pet a moose, but me? I would pet a moose in Ireland.”He suddenly turned the camera on himself, his mouth momentarily filling the screen.“Because we’re in Ireland, we pet mooses around here,” he said. “You feel me?”This was Nix in rare form — in search of a moose to pet before the team’s season opener in Ireland. This was why Irish Chocolate is a celebrity of sorts among classmates and die-hard alumni. And this was, essentially, why Nix has not made an episode since.“Things were going well, man,” Nix said last month, his voice dropping, his eyes drooping. “We were trying to stay focused.”Amid Notre Dame’s undefeated season, one that has landed it in Monday’s Bowl Championship Series title game against Alabama, there was apparently no time for “Chocolate News,” a five-episode distillation of Nix’s irrepressible personality. No time to scold teammates for poor choices at the grocery store, no time to interview Coach Brian Kelly after back surgery, no time to swing a golf club worse than Charles Barkley. No time to broadcast his Irish Chocolate adventures.Nix was a tad busy pressuring quarterbacks and occupying blockers trying to reach linebackers Manti Te’o and Stephon Tuitt, who were all-Americans. Te’o, who finished second in the Heisman Trophy voting, said he would have cast his ballot for Nix. And Tuitt credited Nix’s Irish Chocolate persona for keeping the team loose, like a great clown among children.But Nix insists he is serious now. Kelly may sometimes call him Chocolate Thunder, and his teammates may call him just plain Chocolate, or Sweet Lou, but Nix has matured, his coaches say. He is still Irish Chocolate, but “he’s found a nice blend,” said his position coach, Mike Elston.Nix still fires quips as fast as his first step. His observational banter is uncensored and honest, like his on-field advice. His best work is instinctive.“I’ve always taken what I did seriously,” Nix said, “but at a slower pace.”He first committed to Notre Dame when it had no coach — after Charlie Weis had been fired and before Kelly arrived. He found it preposterous that his future should depend on a coach, and not a university. Then he reported to camp overweight at 368 pounds.Nix was embarrassed. He finished near the back during team sprints, sat as a freshman, started 11 games last season, and then temporarily lost his starting spot in spring practice. He heard coaches whisper he was fit enough for only 15 to 20 plays a game.How much does Nix weigh now? He paused, then with a straight face said, “300,” causing a group of reporters to laugh. But Elston said, in all seriousness, that Nix reported to fall camp in the best shape of his life. On the team’s Web site, Nix is listed at 326 pounds. His official team photo shows him smiling as wide as he can.When he is playing, that expression disappears. Notre Dame center Braxston Cave, who regularly blocks Nix in practice, said, “I don’t think I’ve ever seen him smile on the field.”Nix almost certainly was not smiling this season when Notre Dame needed to stop Stanford twice at its own 1-yard line in overtime to remain undefeated. On both plays, the Cardinal gave the ball to running back Stepfan Taylor up the middle, at Nix. Both times, Nix held his own, penetrated through the offensive line, and, along with Te’o and a mob of defenders, stuffed Taylor.“It’s the last play of the game of a 70-play game,” Elston said. “If he doesn’t have great stamina and great conditioning, he’s going to be tired, he’s going to get a little bit high, he’s going to get knocked off the ball, he’s not going to have the energy to get off the block.”It is on those plays — in close quarters, late in games — when Nix’s quick instincts show. Against Alabama’s all-American center Barrett Jones in the national championship game, Elston said Nix should observe how Jones is blocking him, learn where to shift his weight, when to step and go. On the sideline during games, Nix gives tips to Tuitt, who credited Nix for many of his 12 sacks this season.So Nix had no time for “Chocolate News.”Not that he needed to practice being funny.“It’s who he is,” said Ted Mandell, a professor who has taught Nix in the film, television and theater department. “It’s not anything he’s practicing or working on. He’s just refreshingly off-the-cuff and honest, and he doesn’t censor his comments before he throws them out to the world.”In class, while other students go quiet, Nix sparks discussion: about his mother, who works in a hospital cafeteria; about his 13 siblings and half-siblings and their three-bedroom home in Jacksonville, Fla.; about being Irish Chocolate at Notre Dame. Karen Heisler, another of Nix’s professors, considers him one of her more mature students. She simply calls him Louis.Last month, Nix decided to return for his senior year to please his mother, Stephanie Wingfield, who “literally calls me every day, like 20 times, and I’m so serious,” Nix said. “She’ll call me until I pick up. We talk every day, and she wanted to know if I was coming back.”Wingfield had badgered him to stay so she could attend his senior day at Notre Dame. She had been working at the hospital when she missed his senior day in high school. Nix had not told her about the event, because, he figured, they needed the money and she could not take the day off. His mother cried when she heard she had missed it.So Nix will stay, and bypass a potential N.F.L. paycheck, because, “that’ll make her happy,” he said. “We’ve been surviving this far, so we’ll be O.K., I guess.”When he called to tell his mother his decision, “she didn’t believe me,” Nix said. “I joke with her all the time about it, like: ‘Yeah, I’m leaving Mom. I’ll be back in Jacksonville with the Jaguars — maybe.’ And she’ll be like: ‘No! I’m going to come up there, and we’re going to fight.’ ”Nix hung up after the phone call home, told Kelly he would be back and then called his mother again.“She was like, ‘Are you serious, Louis, because you play a lot?’ ” Nix recalled. “And I was like: ‘Nah, I’m lying mom. I’m leaving, seriously.’ And she’s like, ‘Stop playing with me.’ I ended up telling the truth, but she still didn’t believe me.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/baseball/loyalty-pessimism-and-altruism-at-mets-blood-drive.html,"The warmth of spring training felt far away, the optimism of opening day even more so.But on Thursday morning there were signs of life and baseball in Queens as hundreds of people shuffled through the cold to Citi Field, where the Mets hosted a blood drive to benefit the New York Blood Center. All donors were given a voucher for two free tickets to any home game this April.Many donors were die-hard Mets fans, like Kristen Renda, 27, of Manhattan, who said she attends about a half-dozen games a year. For her, the chance for free tickets seemed too good to pass up.“I do give blood, and it is a good cause,” she said. “But today, it’s more about the Mets.”She added, laughing: “Mr. Met is here. It’s great.”The Mets have had a peculiar off-season. They have made two huge moves, signing David Wright to the largest contract in club history and trading R. A. Dickey, the National League Cy Young winner. But they are the only team in baseball that has not yet signed a major league free agent, and their opening day team could be very similar to the one that finished fourth in the N.L. East last season.Some fans seemed able to cope with the team’s situation.Steve Rabinowitz, 28, walked out of the team store wearing a tattered Mets hat and holding a newly purchased autographed picture of Dwight Gooden. He said he tried to give blood, but he was turned away because he recently had a cold. (The organizers gave him a ticket voucher, anyway.)Rabinowitz, originally from Long Beach, lived for the last three years near San Francisco, where he watched the Giants win two World Series, putting his devotion to the Mets in a strange light. He moved back to New York last month, at the request of his girlfriend, and was looking for work. His goal, he said, was to attend 30 games at Citi Field this year.“I don’t have very high hopes,” he said, “but I guess I am excited to see how the rebuilding goes.”But not all donors were Mets fans, or even baseball fans.Paul Kim, an 18-year-old college student from Flushing, wanted to get tickets for his sister, a Mets fan who has never been to a baseball game.“She asked me last night to come here, so I’m sort of doing it for her,” he said. “I’m kind of a Yankees fan.”But Kim, who said he had given blood five times previously, had his own reasons. “They say you can save three lives every time you give blood,” he said.Yesenia Flores, 28, of Corona, did not even realize free tickets would be available. She donated blood for the first time a few months ago, she said, and found it to be a rewarding cause. She made her way home, ticket voucher in hand, though she was unsure if she would use it.“I don’t even like baseball,” she said. “I’m a soccer girl.”And then there were people like Andy Algarin, 53, of Jackson Heights, a lifelong Mets fan who treated his loyalty to the team as an unlucky character flaw.Algarin, who gives blood regularly, was asked outside the stadium if he was a Mets fan. He responded, “Unfortunately.”He lifted his pants leg up. Covering his entire left calf was a colorful tattoo honoring the 1986 World Series-winning Mets team. “I’m branded for life,” he said.He said he used to attend around 15 games a year when the team played at Shea Stadium. But he said he did not enjoy watching games at Citi Field.Algarin said he would probably attend the game on opening day. But he said he had only been to about 10 games since Citi Field opened and did not expect to go to many this year.“It’s expensive to come to games,” he said. “If you don’t put anything on the field, why am I going to give you my money?”Lately, the only Mets jersey he has worn has been a personalized one with the word “Pessimistic” stretched across the back. The shirt garners a wide variety of reactions from other Mets fans, he said.“I’d like to bite my tongue,” he said, beginning to walk away. “I’d like to take the ‘Pessimistic’ off my shirt. But it’s going to be there for a long time.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/sports/baseball/for-swisher-and-the-indians-a-match-made-in-ohio.html,"CLEVELAND — Whenever Nick Swisher was stationed in right field as a visiting player, he would revel in the song played in the bottom of the eighth inning. “Hang On Sloopy” has official song status in the state of Ohio, and when it blared from the Progressive Field loudspeakers, Swisher, who has roots here, would spell O-H-I-O with his body, Yankee uniform be damned.Little could Swisher have known that the music was only the opening bars to an eventual wedding waltz.The Indians’ successful pursuit of Swisher was officially completed Thursday afternoon with a welcoming news conference that had everyone connected with the team grinning from start to finish. Putting on an Indians cap and a No. 33 jersey, Swisher could not contain a giddiness that he said sprang from joining a club he insisted was ready to do great things — and one located not that far from his native Columbus.The four-year, $56 million contract he signed might have played a role in his happiness, too, Swisher conceded.“To be able to get that was great,” he said of the deal.Of course, Swisher, 32, is almost always full of energy and enthusiasm — “When his eyes open on the pillow, he’s already happy,” Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman once said of him — so why should Thursday’s introduction to Indians fans have been any different?Yes, he is leaving the Yankees, where he generally thrived for four seasons and won a championship ring. He will play for an Indians club that went 68-94 in 2012 and has not been to the postseason since 2007. But he will also be playing for a popular players’ manager in Terry Francona, who sat next to him Thursday.And ultimately, he is Swisher, upbeat to a fault. “Wassup, y’all?” he blurted as he greeted members of the news media as the news conference began. He then grabbed Francona’s left shoulder and shook it, emitting a beaming grin from his new skipper.Several times, Swisher said that the Indians’ decision to hire Francona was an indicator of the team’s commitment winning. But the tributes to his new manager had to compete with all the grins and laughter he produced as he talked about his happiness about returning to his home state. “We’re so excited about this chapter of our lives, and I can’t wait to get going,” Swisher said. Actually, he was referring both to joining the Indians and to the daughter he and his wife, the actress JoAnna Garcia Swisher, are expecting in May.The Indians courted the Swishers with a heavy dose of Ohio. When they walked onto the Progressive Field turf field two weeks ago, before a luncheon meeting, the scoreboard played the fight song for Ohio State, where Swisher played baseball. Videotaped messages from the Buckeyes’ football coach, Urban Meyer, and basketball coach, Thad Matta, were displaced as the two men tried their hand at recruiting a professional athlete. When that luncheon began, Swisher turned around to find the former Ohio State football coach Jim Tressel ready to dine with him.“We put on the full-court press with the Ohio State ties, and it worked,” the Indians’ senior vice president, Bob DiBiasio, said on Thursday.The state’s ties run deep with the Swisher family. His father, the former major league catcher Steve Swisher, attended Ohio University. He said that he planned to see many of his son’s games in person this season.The signing also brings the Swisher-Francona connection full circle. Francona noted Thursday that his manager in Colorado Springs in 1988 was Steve Swisher, and that he was the key to his returning to the major leagues as a player. And like his new player, Francona is the son of a major leaguer.All in all, Steve Swisher said in an interview, “there will be a whole lot of reunions” in Cleveland this season. The next one will occur the next time the Indians’ new right fielder walks into Progressive Field. The team’s home opener, on April 8, will be against the Yankees."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/sports/football/new-general-manager-will-inherit-jets-chaos-plus-rex-ryan.html,"GREEN BAY, Wis. — When Phil Emery took over as general manager of the Chicago Bears last January, he did so with a clear understanding of the team’s coaching situation. Lovie Smith must be retained, he was told, but only for a season. Afterward, if he so desired, Emery would have the freedom to hire a new coach. On Monday, Emery fired Smith.It is not so far-fetched to envision these exact circumstances confronting the new general manager of the Jets. The team on Friday began interviewing candidates to replace Mike Tannenbaum. His replacement will inherit chaos at quarterback, an eroded talent base and a salary-cap situation hamstrung by several onerous contracts. The next general manager will have the autonomy to improve all of those areas, but not to change coaches — at least, not at first.Woody Johnson, the team owner, insisted that Ryan return in 2013, offering Ryan little job security beyond the end of this season, creating problems for him that run far deeper than the discovery, courtesy of the Daily News, of a tattoo of what seems to be his wife wearing a No. 6 Mark Sanchez jersey.Ryan is entering the final year of his contract, a year that figures to be one of transition for the Jets as the new general manager begins installing a plan for long-term stability and sustainability.The top candidates are likely to stipulate that after a season of working with Ryan, they are afforded the same opportunity that the Bears granted Emery. The option could create an intriguing dynamic — a coach in win-now mode, overseeing what should be a roster loaded with new players, and a general manager building for the future and present.The Jets are interested in many of the same candidates as the six other organizations searching for a general manager. At least three — San Diego, Arizona and Cleveland — are also looking for new coaches. Even if the coach is hired first, as appears to have happened with the Chiefs and Andy Reid, he will have the benefit of developing a partnership from the outset with the incoming operations staff.All of the Jets’ six known candidates have a background in personnel, which Tannenbaum, a salary-cap expert, did not. The Jets spoke Friday with David Caldwell, who has spent the past five seasons with the Atlanta Falcons, most recently as director of player personnel. Caldwell, who is also a candidate in Jacksonville, was the Falcons’ director of college scouting for drafts that netted stars like Matt Ryan and Julio Jones. He played at John Carroll University with Greg Roman, the 49ers’ offensive coordinator, and Chris Polian, the former general manager of the Colts and a son of former Indianapolis president Bill Polian, who hired Caldwell in 1998.Tom Heckert, who was fired Monday by Cleveland, is the only contender with general manager experience. He might also join his former Eagles colleague Andy Reid in Kansas City, where another potential Jets candidate, John Dorsey, the Packers’ director of football operations, is under consideration. Also in the Jets’ mix are Scott Cohen, the Jets’ assistant general manager, who would seem a long shot given his ties to the previous regime, and Marc Ross, the Giants’ director of college scouting, who would satisfy the Rooney rule, which requires teams to consider minority candidates.In greatest demand, perhaps, is Tom Gamble, San Francisco’s director of player personnel, who is scheduled to interview with the Jets on Saturday. As the Jets have struggled to add elite talent through the draft in recent years, the 49ers have thrived, selecting NaVorro Bowman, Colin Kaepernick and Aldon Smith.Gamble, a member of the Jets’ coaching staff in 1995 and 1996, is well-acquainted with Ryan: his father, Harry, was the Eagles’ president when Ryan’s father, Buddy, coached in Philadelphia. His arrival would invite speculation that the Jets would pursue deposed 49ers quarterback Alex Smith, and could also defuse what could eventually be an awkward situation with Ryan."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/sports/hockey/more-rinks-in-far-north-find-need-for-cooling-systems.html,"Winter has come to the vast, northernmost reaches of Canada, the sparsely populated area surrounding the Arctic Circle historically characterized by severely cold weather. But these days refrigeration systems are needed to keep the ice cold at hockey arenas.It has been too warm for December hockey in the Arctic, the latest sign that climate change is altering the environment and the way people live — especially in the far north, where the effects of rising temperatures are most pronounced.Nine of the 14 villages in Nunavik, a region in northernmost Quebec, have installed cooling systems at community arenas within the last five years.In Canada’s Nunavut Territory, towns including Arviat, Igloolik, Sanikiluaq and Repulse Bay have resorted to cooling systems. A system is also being installed at the community arena in Cape Dorset, a hamlet of 1,400 just 150 miles south of the Arctic Circle.“We used to have natural ice in the arena in October, but that hasn’t happened for a long time,” said Mike Hayward, a Cape Dorset town official. Now the ice isn’t fit for hockey until mid-January, he said. That is why a cooling system is being installed in the building.The Canadian environmental ministry reports that the country is warming more than twice as fast as the world as a whole, with annual average temperatures in Canada up about 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit since 1948. The warming in winter is even faster, almost 6 degrees Fahrenheit over the same period, and scientists have documented a substantially shorter outdoor skating season as a result.A study published last year by climate scientists at McGill and Concordia universities in Montreal warned that natural ice for skating could disappear from southern Alberta and British Columbia by midcentury and be significantly diminished throughout the rest of the country.“The ability to skate and play hockey outdoors is a critical component of Canadian identity and culture,” the study said. “Wayne Gretzky learned to skate on a backyard skating rink; our results imply that such opportunities may not be available to future generations of Canadian children.”The last several winters have been remarkably warm in Canada, and the winter of 2011-12 was the warmest in the historical record, with temperatures as much as 13 degrees Fahrenheit above normal in parts of the country. Last January, the winter warmth disrupted the N.H.L. All-Star Game festivities in Ottawa, as mild temperatures denied visitors the wintertime tradition of skating on the Rideau Canal.The warming trend has been especially noticeable in the Canadian Arctic.In Cape Dorset, Hayward noted, it rained on Christmas Day in 2010. Last month, on the first day of winter, it was only about 27 degrees.“There’s been a big change over the past few years, to the point where without these systems now, it would not be possible for the villages to make their ice inside the arenas,” said Joe Juneau, a former N.H.L. player who has run a youth hockey program in Nunavik since 2006.“When I started the program, I remember some of the villages starting building their ice in early November,” said Juneau, who holds an aeronautical engineering degree from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. “Now it’s very problematic. Without these systems, it would not be possible anymore for communities to have natural ice in their arenas.”Hockey in the far north is a relatively recent phenomenon, helped largely by government-backed recreational programs and arena construction over the last two decades. Juneau initiated the Nunavik Youth Hockey Development Program to encourage children to stay in school and away from alcohol and drug consumption. More than 1,000 children are involved, and a handful have gone to Montreal to pursue a higher level of play while attending high school.Rankin Inlet, Nunavut, has had an arena since the mid-1980s and produced the N.H.L.’s first Inuit player, Jordin Tootoo. When he grew up there was only one team per age group. The hockey program in Iqaluit, the territorial capital, produced a minor league goalie, Paul Dainton, formerly of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, who played this season with the Springfield Falcons of the A.H.L.Those and other Nunavut towns have busy senior men’s leagues, and tournaments among the territory’s communities are a winter highlight.But the warming climate has forced arena managers in the far north to forgo natural ice and turn to artificially made ice for longer ice seasons.Some rinks installed concrete floors to promote cooling, but others employed newer technologies. The new cooling plants in many Nunavut rinks use a thermosiphon system, in which metal pipes below the arena floor send warm air outside the building.The rinks across Nunavik and in Cape Dorset use a less expensive refrigeration system called Eco-Ice, which employs compressors standing outside the building to draw cool air in, force warm air out, and keep the building interior at a constant temperature of minus-3 Celsius, or 26.6 degrees Fahrenheit.“Eco-Ice systems were installed in Nunavik because the communities wanted to extend the hockey season for the kids,” said Frédéric Gagné, director of the municipal public works department for the region.“With global warming, it’s getting pretty difficult for northern communities to make ice,” said François Bilodeau of LeProhon Group, the Quebec manufacturer of the Eco-Ice system, which has been installed in 42 rinks across Canada in the last 15 years.“If it wasn’t getting so warm, we would probably not be in business,” he said."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/sports/football/matt-schaub-and-texans-seek-to-reassert-themselves-in-playoffs.html,"HOUSTON — The Texans’ offensive linemen roared through the locker room on Segways, scattering the crowd as they headed to their stalls. They began tinkering with their new toys — Christmas gifts from Arian Foster — and quizzing one another on agility, balance and simply staying upright on the two-wheel devices.“How much should you use your legs?”... “Do less. No, do more.” ... “Now floor it.”Finally, somebody shouted, “Be an athlete!”The group conversation could easily have centered on how to prop up Matt Schaub, the struggling quarterback who makes his first playoff appearance Saturday after having played in 118 games during a nine-year career.Except for Schaub, the Texans are essentially the same team that limped into an A.F.C. wild-card game a year ago. They again are the No. 3 seed and again face the Cincinnati Bengals, whom the Texans beat, 31-10, last season at Reliant Stadium. That lone playoff victory in the franchise’s 11 years belongs to the backup T. J. Yates, who started the last eight games and guided the Texans to a 10-6 record after Schaub was sidelined with a fractured foot. That game also means Cincinnati’s second-year quarterback, Andy Dalton, has more postseason experience than Schaub, who was named to his second Pro Bowl based in large part on his play during Houston’s 11-1 start.“Defining moments, they come along, you don’t really realize it when you’re doing it,” Schaub said. “You look back on it when you’re all said and done. For us as a team, it’s a steppingstone. This is the first round of the playoffs to get to our ultimate goal.”Saturday’s game could not come with the Texans at a much lower ebb. They have lost three of their last four, and Schaub has looked powerless to pull the team out of its swoon, much less author a signature moment to pull out a victory.Houston fans are reacting as if their 12-4 football team has suddenly turned into the lowly Astros. The Reliant Stadium crowd booed the Texans late in a 23-6 loss to the Minnesota Vikings, a game that could have assured them the No. 1 A.F.C. playoff seed.“Certainly he’s made some plays, he just hasn’t made all the plays,” the offensive coordinator Rick Dennison said of Schaub. “And we expect him to make all the plays.”Schaub threw one touchdown pass and three interceptions in that four-game stretch. Over all, the Texans’ offense reached the end zone only three times with Schaub on the field. Behind a line with three Pro Bowl players, he was sacked 12 times (after being taken down 18 times in the first 12 games), suggesting bad blocking and bad decisions on Schaub’s part in targeting receivers other than Andre Johnson.Drives stalled with such alarming frequency that Shayne Graham kicked 10 of his 31 field goals in the last three games.Tackle Duane Brown, one of six Houston offensive players and eight over all to earn Pro Bowl honors, said the focus should not fall entirely on Schaub.“You can’t look at him so much and put so much pressure on him,” Brown said. “It’s up to all of us to make his job that much easier. I don’t think he deserves all the criticism that he’s taking.”Schaub said, “As far as what’s going on in the huddle, there’s a confidence level and attention to detail this week that we’re going to go out and get this thing done.”The Texans are not panicking; they can point to their 0-3 slide to end the 2011 season and subsequent wild-card victory over the Bengals as reasons not to worry. Still, a monthlong case of doubt clearly has crept into their psyches as they lost what appeared to be an ironclad top seed, a bye week and home-field advantage throughout the playoffs.“It got to the point where there was so much pressure on us to perform well, we went out and were thinking too much and trying not to mess up,” Brown said. “There was a lot of emphasis put on it, and for good reason. We just kind of got uptight. This week, I think we’re just going to go out and have fun.”Coach Gary Kubiak criticized himself this week for not using more creative play-calling to give Schaub better opportunities to succeed. Offensive linemen spoke of alleviating stress on Schaub as if referring to a spa treatment. Foster took a philosophical approach, turning to another medium as a diversion.“I don’t really watch TV that much,” he said. “I’ve been reading a lot of books lately. They don’t have any opinions on the Texans.”Most of the frustration has been directed at Schaub, whose stoic demeanor might translate as indifference for fans wanting to see a fiery, demonstrative leader. Schaub can be maddeningly even-keeled in his tone and comments, and understands he comes across that way.“That’s just my personality. That’s how I am. I thought you’d know that by now,” he told reporters this week. “I’ve been the same guy since I stepped foot here. This is how I am. I try to keep things the same, keep my routine the same, keep my preparation the same.”Fair or not, he has already been judged harshly for a quarterback making his first playoff appearance, a two-time Pro Bowler seeking the same answers as his Segway-riding linemen.“I’ve just got to play a little more consistent,” Schaub said. “I definitely know when things aren’t going well to look at myself first, because I’m the one that’s putting everyone in position and trying to make the plays. I’ve got to play better. Our whole team, everyone across the board has got to pick their game up, especially this time of year. But I definitely do.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/sports/hockey/nhl-talks-with-mediator-inch-along.html,"Talks to settle the N.H.L. lockout slowed to a crawl Friday, just one week from Commissioner Gary Bettman’s Jan. 11 target date for saving the season. Negotiators from the N.H.L. and the players’ association did not even enter the same room at any point.Instead, whatever bargaining the sides did was conducted through Scot L. Beckenbaugh, a federal mediator who spent about 12 hours shuttling the streets of Midtown Manhattan between the league office and the hotel where union officials were staying.Beckenbaugh’s last meeting with the union lasted two and a half hours and ended in the late afternoon. From there he went to the league office, where he met with league officials until 10:30 p.m.Gary Meagher, an N.H.L. spokesman, said that mediation would resume Saturday at 10:30 a.m.To underscore the highly fragile state of the talks, there was more activity in the courts Friday. Lawyers from the league and the union told United States District Court Judge Paul A. Engelmayer that the sides did not require an expedited decision to rule on a pre-emptive suit filed last month by the N.H.L.That suit seeks to declare unlawful any move by the union to dissolve itself to allow individual players to file antitrust lawsuits against the N.H.L. The union is seeking to dismiss the league’s suit. Engelmayer will hold a preliminary hearing in New York on Monday morning.Meanwhile, the players’ association membership was voting on whether to authorize Donald Fehr, the union’s executive director, to disclaim interest and effectively dissolve the union. The vote was to be completed at 6 p.m. Saturday; it is expected to overwhelmingly grant Fehr the authorization.Last month the players voted overwhelmingly to authorize the move until midnight Wednesday. That deadline passed, which was seen as a sign that trust was being built between the sides.But on Thursday, players and union officials were angered when they saw changed language in an agreement stipulating financial and draft choice penalties against clubs caught “hiding” hockey-related revenue. The new clause had Commissioner Gary Bettman deciding the penalties, but after complaints from the union, the previous language was restored.Chris Phillips of the Ottawa Senators, who was not present at the talks, told reporters in Ottawa it was a “dirty trick.” League officials denied the accusation, saying the clause was inserted earlier but went unnoticed by the union.Despite the distrust and rancor between the league and the union and the day’s slow pace, officials with the players’ association said that the mediated talks were useful.Nevertheless, the chance remained that the 2012-13 season would join the N.H.L.’s 2004-5 season, which Bettman canceled because of a lockout, as the only major league seasons in North American sport to be canceled because of a labor dispute."

His deal came hours after the Chiefs said they had parted with General Manager Scott Pioli after four tumultuous seasons.Reid inherits a team that went 2-14, matching the worst record in franchise history. But it will have the No. 1 pick in the N.F.L. draft, and with five players voted to the Pro Bowl, Kansas City has building blocks in place to make a quick turnaround.It is expected Reid will pursue the longtime Packers personnel man John Dorsey to work with him as general manager.Reid takes over for Romeo Crennel, who was fired Monday after one full season.The addition of Reid should help stabilize a team that was expected to contend for the A.F.C. West title but instead floundered.Reid has experience turning around franchises. He took over a team in Philadelphia that was 3-13 and two years later went 11-5 and finished second in the N.F.C. East. That began a stretch of five straight years in which Reid won at least 11 games and included a trip to the Super Bowl after the 2004 season.Reid had a 130-93-1 record and the most wins in Eagles history, but was just 12-20 the past two seasons.The Chiefs issued a statement Friday that said they had “mutually parted ways” with Pioli after a tenure marked by poor draft choices, ineffective free-agent moves, failed coaching hires and a growing fan rebellion.EAGLES INTERVIEWS The Eagles will interview the Colts’ offensive coordinator, Bruce Arians, and the Seahawks’ defensive coordinator, Gus Bradley, for their coaching vacancy.The Eagles, who fired Andy Reid on Monday after a 4-12 season, will meet with the Broncos’ offensive coordinator, Mike McCoy, on Sunday in Denver.

He was a regular in nickel packages and had 33 tackles and a forced fumble before his suspension.SEAHAWKS TO START BROWNER  Cornerback Brandon Browner is expected to start for the Seattle Seahawks in the playoff opener Sunday at Washington despite just returning this week from his four-game suspension for violating the league policy on performance-enhancing substances.Coach Pete Carroll said that Browner looked fine in practice but that he would be watched for signs of fatigue during the game.PONDER QUESTIONABLE The Minnesota Vikings have listed quarterback Christian Ponder and cornerback Antoine Winfield as questionable for their playoff game against Green Bay.Ponder bruised his right elbow when it hit a Packers helmet while throwing Sunday, but he stayed in the game to finish one of the best performances of his career.Winfield has a broken right hand. He had to come out of the game on Sunday when it swelled, but Winfield said he would definitely play in the rematch."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/opinion/a-soccer-stadium-but-where.html,"A tour of the old World’s Fair grounds in Queens on a recent weekday felt a little like walking through an aging Hollywood stage set. In the 1930s, superbuilder Robert Moses converted what had been a miserable ash heap covering more than 1,300 acres into a suitable site for the 1939-40 World’s Fair — complete with grand pools, fountains and boulevards. The 140 feet high Unisphere, built for the 1964-65 World’s Fair, languishes at one end of what is now known as Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, a vast, overused and underfinanced public space and the largest city park in Queens.For all its shabbiness, this park is greatly coveted, not only by Queens residents but by popular and profitable sports enterprises. The United States Tennis Association has been a major leaseholder since the United States Open arrived in 1978. Now Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Major League Soccer officials are talking about a new soccer stadium, partly as a way to help rejuvenate the park.The 25,000-seat stadium would replace a large, gummy pond once referred to as the Pool of Industry, and the league has promised to completely restore the park’s raggedy public soccer fields before it breaks ground on a new facility. One argument for having a major league team in Queens is that many New Yorkers who came from soccer-mad nations now live nearby and would presumably support a local franchise. Another is that it could provide a source of revenue to help fix up the park.But there is a long way to go before this tantalizing idea becomes a workable reality. City and league officials will have to convince the community that replacing about 13 acres of open parkland with a private facility would be an improvement. They would also have to find an equivalent amount of suitable parkland elsewhere in the community. City Councilwoman Julissa Ferreras calls the park “the heart and lungs” of a community that, she says, “cannot afford to lose one inch of public green space.”Flushing Meadows has already lost some of its territory to the tennis association, which is seeking to enlarge its existing footprint. Though the association, whose courts are mostly public, has made some efforts to reach out to the community, many Queens residents see the center as a playground for Manhattanites with little connection to their community. Local skepticism about another stadium is thus to be expected. To overcome it, major league soccer will have to add more public resources before taking away a few acres of a beloved park."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/tennis/serena-williams-wins-tuneup-for-the-australian-open.html,"Serena Williams showed that the break between seasons did not hurt her momentum as she captured the 47th title of her career with a 6-2, 6-1 victory over Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova on Saturday in the Brisbane International final in Australia.Williams has won 35 of her past 36 matches, including titles at Wimbledon, the Olympics, the United States Open, the season-ending WTA championships and now the first event of 2013.She has won the Australian Open five times, and with the season’s first major a little more than a week away, she is in good shape to add another title in Melbourne.The Brisbane final was over in 50 minutes, with Williams dictating terms from the first break of serve in the sixth game.“I always feel like I don’t know how to play tennis when I play against you,” Pavlyuchenkova told Williams at the trophy presentation.The two traveled together on a training trip to Mauritius in the off-season but did not really hit against each other at the time.“But this was true, what I said,” the 36th-ranked Pavlyuchenkova, who has won three WTA titles and more than $2.8 million in prize money, later said of her postmatch assessment. “When she’s on fire, well, I feel like there is not much I can do. I mean, she’s a great player and she deserves to win.”Williams said she had been concentrating on being calm and composed, and has started to feel serene when she is in her zone on court. She has been feeling that way a lot in her comeback since a first-round loss at the French Open, her earliest exit from a Grand Slam tournament.“I was looking at a lot of old matches on YouTube, and I feel like right now I’m playing some of my best tennis,” Williams, a 15-time major winner, said. “I feel like I want to do better and play better still.”In a tournament featuring eight of the world’s top 10 female players, not one match in Brisbane featured two seeded players because of a series of injuries and upsets. Second-ranked Maria Sharapova withdrew because of an injured collarbone, and Pavlyuchenkova ousted a pair of top-10 players: the 2011 Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova in the second round and fourth-seeded Angelique Kerber in the quarterfinals.Williams missed a chance to extend her 11-1 record against top-ranked Victoria Azarenka, who withdrew a half-hour before their scheduled semifinal Friday because of an infected toe.Williams, 31, can regain the No. 1 ranking if she wins the Australian OpenIn the men’s draw, Andy Murray advanced to the final when fifth-seeded Kei Nishikori retired with an injured left knee while trailing, 6-4, 2-0, in their semifinal.Murray, the Olympic and United States Open champion, will next meet 21-year-old Grigor Dimitrov, who is starting to live up to his billing as a star in the making by reaching his first ATP Tour final with a 6-3, 5-7, 7-6 (5) victory over Marcos Baghdatis.SPAIN TAKES HOPMAN CUP In Perth, Australia, Spain defeated Serbia, 2-1, to win the Hopman Cup for the fourth time.Fernando Verdasco and Anabel Medina Garrigues won the deciding mixed doubles, 6-4, 7-5, against Novak Djokovic and Ana Ivanovic.Djokovic took the first match for Serbia by overcoming a strong challenge from Verdasco, 6-3, 7-5.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/hockey/nhl-and-players-union-meet-face-to-face.html,"In a move engineered by a federal mediator, Gary Bettman and Donald Fehr met Saturday for a daylong bargaining session, the first face-to-face talks between the N.H.L. and the players union since negotiations broke down on Thursday.The session had an all-or-nothing feel to it. It took place as players completed a vote on whether to authorize Fehr to dissolve the union if negotiations stalled. If Fehr were to exercise that option, it would very likely end the bargaining and send the proceedings to court.Yet at the same time, hopes soared that a settlement to the 112-day lockout could be close. Bettman had set a deadline of Jan. 11 for saving a 48-game schedule. If a settlement is reached by then, the season will start no later than Jan. 20. An earlier settlement could allow for a 50-game schedule.“Talks are continuing,” Bill Daly, the N.H.L.’s deputy commissioner, said in an e-mail as the talks ground through their ninth hour. “Slow progress.”Scot L. Beckenbaugh, deputy director of the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service, spent 12 hours Friday shuttling between the N.H.L. office in Midtown Manhattan and the union’s hotel two blocks away.Under federal mediation rules, Beckenbaugh was not allowed to reveal to one side what the other side had said. Rather, he was bound to discuss the issues with each side and learn how far each was willing to go without indicating what the other had said.Finally he determined that it would be worthwhile to bring the sides together for a bargaining session, which began at 1:15 p.m. Saturday at the union’s hotel. Beckenbaugh was present for the talks, which were still going as the clock approached midnight.Voting on the measure authorizing Fehr to disclaim interest ended at 6 p.m., with the players approving the measure by an overwhelming margin.A disclaimer would be tantamount to dissolving the union and would enable individual players to file antitrust suits against the N.H.L. If the courts found that the lockout was unlawful, the N.H.L. could owe the players billions of dollars in damages.Fehr was not expected to disclaim interest while progress was being made in negotiations. On Wednesday, he allowed an earlier disclaimer authorization to expire, but the players immediately voted to reauthorize, renewing the threat to sue.The sides entered Saturday believed to be close on the issues that were blocking a settlement, and Beckenbaugh apparently found common ground Friday.At lunchtime, the league wanted a 2013-14 salary cap at $60 million a club, down from $70.2 million for 2012-13. But the league moved to $62.5 million, according to reports, closer to the union’s demand of $65 million. In the early evening, the union dropped slightly to $64.3 million, the upper limit for the 2011-12 season.Differences were small in other areas as well. The league wanted individual contracts limited to six years, or seven years for teams re-signing players. The union’s demand was eight years.The union and the league had previously agreed on a player-financed pension. But the players wanted the owners to guarantee the pension fund in case of a future shortfall. The league and the union reportedly reached an agreement that either side could opt out of a new collective bargaining agreement in the 8th year of a 10-year agreement. The players entered the day pushing for an opt-out clause after seven years. Beckenbaugh has been involved in the current round of bargaining since the week began. Mediation in other recent sports lockouts has only occasionally been successful. The 2011 N.F.L. lockout was settled that July with a mediator present for some of the final bargaining sessions. However, that was after 17 straight days of unsuccessful mediation in February and March.In the 2011 N.B.A. lockout, mediation in October and early November failed to bring about a settlement. The dispute finally ended after direct talks between the owners and the players in late November. Beckenbaugh served as a mediator during the 2004-5 N.H.L. lockout. His intervention could not stop that season from being canceled.The current lockout is the third since Bettman became the N.H.L.’s commissioner in 1993. Games have been canceled through Jan. 14, amounting to a little more than 50 percent of the regular-season schedule.  If the lockout is settled and the schedule is restored, each team would play 48 or 50 games, with no games outside the conference."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/football/in-emotional-season-the-colts-never-broke.html,"INDIANAPOLIS — Coach Chuck Pagano began giving out the links of a chain before the first game of the Indianapolis Colts’ season. It was before they had reason to think he was doing anything more than trying to make a metaphor real, to bind a team of youngsters and castoffs, a few remaining veterans and those imported to be part of what Pagano refused to call a rebuilding but instead labeled a renovation.As he handed a link to each player, Pagano delivered his message.“He said you could be the last one, you could be the first one, but don’t be the missing one,” defensive end Cory Redding said. “Everybody on that team, when new guys came in, they got a link. We needed everybody to stay strong.”The players still have their links. Redding’s is on a chain. Safety Tom Zbikowski keeps his in his bag. Punter Pat McAfee’s is with his car keys. But on that late summer night, Pagano did not account for one link, the one he became a few weeks later: unseen, but strong enough to keep the team he had bound since spring workouts from failing when everything around it seemed to be falling apart.The giant inflatable Colts player that welcomed Pagano back to work after his nearly three-month leave for leukemia treatment was gone from the team headquarters’ snow-covered lawn last week.The only reminders of Pagano’s ordeal are a small Chuckstrong sign in a locker room, the tiny orange stickers with his initials on each players’ nameplate, the hair on his head that is slowly growing back and the streams of text messages he sent from the hospital, late at night or in the middle of games, advising his players to take shorter steps on a punt or cursing them for allowing so many rushing yards.Pagano, coaching in absentia after his treatment began during the fourth week of the season, guided one of the most inspiring performances in an N.F.L. season; almost everyone but the Colts says they overachieved.The Colts won seven games with second-half comebacks from a tie or deficit, and it seems fitting that their season will come full circle in Baltimore, where Pagano was the defensive coordinator last season and where the Colts will play the Ravens on Sunday in an A.F.C. wild-card game.“Guys had talked about it from Day 1, when we all got together in the off-season, we laid out our goals and expectations,” Pagano said in an interview last week. “We said just because of all the turnover and change, this guy is gone, that guy’s gone, we weren’t going to let anything determine the outcome of our season and how we played the game. So sitting back and watching, starting with the Green Bay game, all they knew was 60 minutes, all you’ve got, one play at a time. Don’t look at the scoreboard, don’t judge, just play hard. And expect something really good to happen when you do that.”In Week 5, the Packers game was the first of the Colts’ comeback victories and the first game that Pagano watched from a distance. That made him feel powerless, despite the dry-erase board with the depth chart hung in his hospital room, despite the iPad the team loaded with practice film.Even before Pagano’s illness, the Colts were the longest shot in the league. Their wrenching separation from Peyton Manning last March, after a two-win season that cost Jim Caldwell and Bill Polian their jobs, dominated the headlines while their remaking of the roster flew under the radar. When the Colts take the field against the Ravens, only 17 players on the 53-man roster will have been with the team last season. (Eight additional players on injured reserve were with the Colts in 2011.)Among the new players is Jerrell Freeman, one of the league’s most productive linebackers, who was General Manager Ryan Grigson’s first signee. Freeman is an alumnus of the University of Mary Hardin-Baylor, which was a Texas women’s college until 1971 and played its first football game in 1998, and the Canadian Football League. A more recent addition is kickoff returner Deji Karim, who was working a month ago as a hotel parking attendant in Oklahoma City. Twenty-eight Colts will be making their first playoff appearance, including 14 rookies or first-year players, and as many as five rookies could start on offense on Sunday.It fell to the offensive coordinator, Bruce Arians, to hold them together during Pagano’s absence. Practice times and routines were not altered.Pagano made a point of staying in touch with his players. Redding said he received this text at halftime of a game: “If you read this at halftime, set the freaking edge.” McAfee said he had so many conversations and exchanged so many texts with Pagano that he wondered: “Don’t you have something you should be doing? Shouldn’t you be beating leukemia right now?” Arians talked to Pagano almost every morning, then delivered Pagano’s message to the team. Redding said it was almost as if Pagano were using sign language with Arians as his interpreter.“B. A. has been around football a long time,” quarterback Andrew Luck said. “He’s seen most everything and knows how to handle situations. I think he understood what Chuck’s message was so well, it seemed seamless to us that he could continue that message. It wasn’t an abrupt change. It sort of felt like Chuck was never gone, almost. It was interesting to see him on the sideline again — oh, my gosh, that is Coach. I guess it is back to the routine.”Pagano would like that. He wants to stop talking about his illness: the diagnosis, the chemotherapy, the migraines and the night sweats. Reviewing it when he returned, before the final regular-season game, was emotionally exhausting. The pregame ceremony to welcome him back produced sustained applause from the Houston Texans and almost brought Pagano to tears. Now he is ready to get back to something closer to normal, to return to the thrilling mundanity of preparing for a playoff game.In the rush to return to work, Pagano, whose plight had motivated the Colts, allowed himself to wonder if his presence might upset their balance. But for the Colts, it has become impossible to separate inspiration from maturation.“I think camaraderie is something that is overlooked a lot,” McAfee said. “Chuck’s big thing at the start of the year was, ‘We’ve got to become a team, a family.’ It was like our dad getting sick, so we all had to rally together for something that was bigger than us. It really brought our team together, especially for a young team that doesn’t know much about each other.”When his leukemia, a treatable form, was diagnosed, Pagano asked his doctor for the odds and the game plan for his care. When he got to work last Monday, Pagano said, his world was back to normal. His doctors cautioned him not to overdo it, but Pagano re-immersed himself immediately in the details of coaching, getting the update on the weather and the grass conditions for practice, then bounding around in the bitter cold to take it all in.“It’s almost surreal,” Pagano said. “When you’re going through it, the days are long. Three months later, you sit back, and I’ve had time to reflect with my wife and family, and it’s almost like, ‘Did we actually just go through what we went through?’“I said there was never a doubt I would beat this and be back with my team. I didn’t know when that would be, but I’d be back. I told them there was never a doubt in my mind ever since we got together that this team could accomplish anything they set their minds to accomplish. When you have a faith and belief in something and you come together the way this team has come together as a family, the sky’s the limit. There was never a doubt I would beat my illness, and never a doubt whether you were down one score, two scores, all the comebacks we had, never a doubt you guys could get it done.”Pagano got it done, too. During the months he was sick, the chain did not break. He was not the missing link."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/football/redskins-alfred-morris-playing-at-full-throttle.html,"The Washington Redskins, improbable winners of the N.F.C. East for the first time since 1999, will host the most eagerly anticipated game in their recent history Sunday when they meet the Seattle Seahawks to complete the wild-card round.Washington has relied on a couple of wunderkinds — quarterback Robert Griffin III and running back Alfred Morris — to emerge as the fifth team in N.F.L. history to reach the playoffs after dropping six of its first nine games. It has whipped the capital into a frenzy.Morris’s mother, Yvonne, is among those swept up in the buzz after her son, a sixth-round draft choice from Florida Atlantic, produced an individual performance as impressive as the resurgence of the Redskins. His team-record 1,613 rushing yards represent the third-highest total in league history for a rookie, trailing only Eric Dickerson (1,808, yards for the Los Angeles Rams in 1983) and George Rogers (1,647, for the New Orleans Saints in 1981).She could not be more thrilled for the Redskins and prouder of her son. And yet she will not be in the stands for the most important game of his life because she has another priority.She teaches reading to 9th and 10th graders at Pine Forest High School in Pensacola, Fla., and the 4:30 p.m. start would force her to miss classes Monday.“I have an obligation to those kids,” she said. “I really love teaching, and it is kind of difficult to part ways.”Her son’s out-of-nowhere rise — he played fullback at the Senior Bowl — points to how successful she was in instilling in him a strong work ethic and sense of commitment. Morris has pushed himself so hard since he took hold of the starting job in training camp that the offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan finds it impossible to slow him down, even during practices when players are asked to just go through the motions.“We make fun of him because he won’t ever go walk-through tempo,” Shanahan said. “He’s always full speed.”Morris learned quickly to go hard or be left behind as the fourth of seven sons born to Yvonne and her husband, Ronald, who is a chef.If he needed additional motivation, it came when Florida Atlantic was the only N.C.A.A. Division I program to offer him a scholarship and when all 32 N.F.L. teams passed until Washington chose him 173rd over all amid concerns about his size (5 feet 9 inches, 216 pounds) and speed (4.68 in the 40-yard dash).“I’ve been an underdog my whole life,” Morris said during a phone interview this week. “People underestimate you, but I’ve always believed in myself.”Dave Serna, the former running backs coach at Florida Atlantic, is one of the few who saw potential in Morris after watching him play linebacker and running back at Pine Forest. He saw what could not be measured.“When you met the kid,” Serna said, “you knew with the ability he had he was going to turn into a special guy at some point because he had that little extra something you look for.”That hard-to-define quality helped Morris blossom into the perfect complement to the dynamic Griffin, who passed for 3,200 yards with 20 touchdowns and 5 interceptions while running for another 815 yards and seven more scores. They are the first rookie teammates in league history to combine for more than 3,000 passing yards and 1,500 rushing yards. They feed off each other in every way.Griffin delights in Morris’s ability to keep barreling forward after contact.“He makes runs that are blocked for 3 yards, 7-yard gains,” he said. “He’s out there running over guys, continuing to move his legs, getting those hard yards.”Morris said of Griffin: “It’s been fun watching him grow as a player and a leader and a quarterback. He’s definitely a phenomenal player. He elevates everybody around him.”Griffin’s every move has been scrutinized since Washington traded up to draft him second over all after he won the Heisman Trophy in 2011 at Baylor. That allowed Morris, taken with a sixth-round pick obtained from the Minnesota Vikings in exchange for the fading quarterback Donovan McNabb, to chew up yardage in the background until recently.“It does take pressure off of you when you are not in the limelight,” Morris said. “He does a great job of handling the pressure and the hype. Me, I don’t care for media attention at all. I don’t play to get recognition. I play because I love the game. It does take a lot of stress and pressure off of you when you don’t constantly have cameras in your face.”That very likely changed for good when Morris, asked to carry an enormous load with Griffin battling a knee injury, responded with 200 yards and 3 touchdowns in Washington’s division-clinching 28-18 victory over the visiting Dallas Cowboys last Sunday night. He averaged 117 yards in helping Washington to close the regular season with a seven-game winning streak. The Redskins, adroitly executing the zone blocking favored by Coach Mike Shanahan, topped the league in rushing for the first time since 1933 with a team-record 2,709 yards.For all of his newfound fame, Morris continues to endure the playful barbs of teammates for driving a 1991 Mazda to practice.“I love who I am,” he said. “I wouldn’t change anything for the world.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/football/nfl-hones-message-for-its-female-fans.html,"At Cowboys Stadium, fans can buy a standing golf bag, a Kobe beef burger and thong underwear emblazoned with the team’s star logo.Displayed alongside lacy sports bras and flared sweat pants, Cowboys underwear is one of many offerings at the stadium’s Victoria’s Secret Pink store, the first to open inside a sports complex.The move is emblematic of a broader marketing effort by the N.F.L. to engage female fans, who make up a rising share of the league’s base.“We clearly get that our female fans are our consumers,” said Charlotte Jones Anderson, a Cowboys’ executive vice president, who pushed hard to get a Pink store inside the stadium. “They’re really the ones that make our business tick.”In recent years, the N.F.L. surpassed the N.B.A. and Major League Baseball in the share of its regular-season viewers who are female, according to Nielsen. More women watched the Super Bowl — 43 million — than the Grammy Awards or the Academy Awards last year.“Women are the custodians of most decisions made in the households,” said Mark Waller, the chief marketing officer of the N.F.L. Describing football as “the last great campfire,” which brings families together on Sundays as reliably as church, Waller said women were at the heart of the sport’s most sacred rituals.At the same time, player safety has become a prominent issue in the league, and more research and awareness has developed on head injuries in the sport. Female fans, particularly those with children, may become decision makers about participation in football. A Centers for Disease Control study released in September showed that N.F.L. players were three times more likely to die of neurodegenerative diseases than the general population.“This is a powerful issue for everybody,” Waller said, but women “have more of a role to play in managing that issue.”The N.F.L.’s goal is to convert casual fans, a category that describes the majority of female football watchers, into die-hards. There are overt gestures, like the ubiquitous pink lining the field and accenting uniforms to commemorate breast cancer awareness month in October. But the league has also made more subtle changes in how it reaches its female audience.Long gone are the days of “pink it and shrink it,” the decades-old approach to women’s N.F.L. apparel. A women’s wear line started in 2010 offers sleek, fitted jerseys in team colors, delighting lifelong fans like Kerry Ann Sullivan.“I want to wear the colors of the team — I don’t want to wear a softened up version of it,” said Sullivan, 39, who said that she and her brother learned simple math as children by adding a touchdown to a field goal and a 2-point-conversion.“Now I like it because they’re just making it something that you’d want to wear,” she added.Celebrity spokeswomen like Serena Williams have appeared in Vogue and Cosmopolitan wearing the new gear, sandwiched between ads for high-end perfume and designer jeans.N.F.L. television commercials this season have also featured women in prominent roles. One shows a young woman emulating the macho victory pose favored by Green Bay Packers linebacker Clay Matthews as she watches a game on her cellphone.Other ads, some produced by the N.F.L., address safety concerns. One features a mother being thanked by her son and by the former Giants star Michael Strahan for promoting her son’s safety on the football field. Another has New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady helping to answer a mother’s questions about what the N.F.L. is doing about player safety. But it is not clear that female fans view the risks of the game any differently than men.“There is nothing like the sound of two helmets crunching,” said Alexis Aarons, 27, who swears allegiance to the Philadelphia Eagles. “It signifies football. There’s no crunching like that in basketball.”Aarons, whose father is an Eagles season-ticket holder, said she remembered having a front-row view of a collision in 2008 that left a player unconscious on the field for about 20 minutes. But she said such scenes would not deter her from letting her children play.“If I were a parent, telling my child that they can’t do something that they’re passionate about?” she said, “I just don’t think that that’s fair.”Deepi Sidhu, such a staunch supporter of the Indianapolis Colts that she once missed a friend’s wedding because a critical Colts game went into overtime, has three children.“Ignorance is bliss sometimes,” she said, “The more you know about concussions and brain damages, why would you send your child into that?”On the other hand, Sidhu recognized the attraction of the game.“I have friends that put their kids in football and the kids loved it,” she said. “I might consider letting let my son play when he’s one of the bigger kids.”Syreeta Hubbard, 33, said she was frightened when her son would come home from practice complaining of a headache.“I always try to push him into lacrosse or baseball,” she said.Still, violence belongs in the sport, said Hubbard, who has loved the Baltimore Ravens — known for their hard-hitting style — since they moved to her hometown in 1996.“That’s the reality of the game,” she said.Hubbard compared women’s interest in football to the spectacle of gladiator games in ancient Rome but acknowledged some differences, saying, “We don’t get to see people beheaded, thank God!”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/baseball/hall-of-fame-tally-on-barry-bonds-and-roger-clemens-will-offer-verdict-on-steroids.html,"At 2 p.m. Wednesday, when the Baseball Writers’ Association of America discloses whether Barry Bonds and Roger Clemens received enough votes to be inducted to the Hall of Fame, it will deliver the most significant verdict to date on baseball’s steroid era.There are at least some indications that the players will fall short.Bonds and Clemens are the most accomplished players ever linked directly to the use of performance-enhancing drugs, or P.E.D.’s. Bonds is a record seven-time most valuable player and the holder of the single-season and career marks for home runs; Clemens is a record seven-time winner of the Cy Young Award, with 354 career victories. Both endured federal trials on perjury charges stemming from their denials of drug use, with Bonds being found guilty of one count of obstruction of justice in April 2011 and Clemens being acquitted of all charges last June.Without their drug links, they would be automatic choices for Cooperstown, which requires being named on at least 75 percent of the hundreds of ballots cast each December by members of the writers association. But not now, not in a time when journalists who cover the sport are still trying to figure out what lines should be drawn in weighing achievements on the field against whatever drug use may have occurred off it.In the case of Bonds and Clemens, the line may be going more or less down the middle, leaving both players with enough voter support to not feel humiliated but without enough to gain entry to the Hall, at least for now.Over a month ago, The Associated Press surveyed more than 100 members of the association and found Bonds with 45 percent support and Clemens with 43. Over the last week, The New York Times did its own survey, and to the more than 60 responses added 30 additional voters who in recent weeks had publicly stated how they marked their ballots.That resulted in a combined 92 voters, representing about one-sixth of the ballots cast last year. In that sample, 43 voters (or 47 percent) said they were supporting Clemens and Bonds, roughly conforming to the findings in the survey by The Associated Press. Notably, not one person in the Times survey reported casting a vote for either Bonds or Clemens but not both. The two players clearly seem to be a package; either you look past their drug links and judge their whole careers and vote for both of them, or you don’t.In addition, while Clemens was acquitted at trial and Bonds was not, that did not seem to be a factor in the survey. They are, in essence, running together.Trailing way behind them was Sammy Sosa, who is also in his first year on the ballot. Sosa, the former Chicago Cubs slugger, is eighth on the career list with 609 career home runs, hit more than 60 home runs three times in a four-year period and engaged in an epic 1998 battle with Mark McGwire that shattered Roger Maris’s longstanding record of 61 home runs in a season.However, in June 2009, The Times reported that Sosa had tested positive in 2003, when Major League Baseball conducted one year of anonymous drug testing that then led to a full-scale testing regimen. The news of the positive test seemed to fortify widespread suspicions that Sosa had used performance-enhancers. And in contrast to Clemens and Bonds, who had many years of great success before being linked to drug use, Sosa’s home run prowess seemed completely intertwined with the perceived use of P.E.D.’s.In the A.P. survey, Sosa drew just 18 percent support. In the Times survey, Sosa did even worse, garnering support from just 11 of the 92 voters, or 12 percent.Those figures put him in the embarrassing territory now populated by Rafael Palmeiro, who has barely exceeded 10 percent support in his first two years on the ballot, and McGwire, who has never been named on more than 24 percent of the ballots in his half-dozen years of eligibility.Palmeiro is one of only four players in baseball history to amass more than 3,000 hits and 500 home runs, but he was suspended for a positive drug test in 2005 not long after insisting at a televised Congressional hearing that he had never used steroids. McGwire’s image was badly damaged by his evasiveness at the same hearing; his admission in 2010 that he had used performance enhancers has not generated new support in the balloting.And like Sosa, both Palmeiro and McGwire are viewed as players who were nowhere near the skill level of Bonds and Clemens.In addition to Clemens, Bonds and Sosa, there is a fourth first-year candidate on this year’s ballot who may be affected by the voters’ attitudes on the steroid era: Mike Piazza. He is widely regarded as one of the best hitting catchers in baseball history and holds the career mark for most home runs by a catcher with 396 (he hit 427 in all).But while Piazza is not known to have tested positive for a performance enhancer and was not directly linked to drug use, he has been viewed skeptically by some, raising questions as to whether he, too, will fall short in the voting. The Associated Press survey did not address his candidacy; The Times, in its compilation, showed him being named on 57 of the 92 ballots, a 63 percent showing that puts him within reach of being inducted.There are other first-time notables on the ballot, led by Craig Biggio, who played various positions (catcher, second base and center field) while amassing over 3,000 hits, and Curt Schilling, who was never at a loss for words or clutch performances in the postseason. And Jeff Bagwell, who, like Piazza, has encountered drug suspicions, will be looking to climb from 56 percent support in his third time on the ballot.But in the end, it will come back to Bonds and Clemens on Wednesday, and how voters sorted out the taint from the talent.“The Hall of Fame is not a church, it is the history of baseball,” said Ray Ratto, a Comcast SportsNet Bay Area writer who has been a member of the association for 20 years and voted for both Clemens and Bonds. “The Hall of Fame already includes men who helped institute and defend the color line, and there is no defensible argument that makes the color line more benign than P.E.D. use.”Bernie Wilson, an Associated Press writer who is based in San Diego and voted for neither Clemens nor Bonds, said: “The beauty of the Hall of Fame process is that candidates are on the ballot for 15 years. There’s always the possibility I’ll change my mind on Clemens and Bonds down the road. What’s the harm in making them wait?”On Wednesday, the debate continues."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/football/arian-foster-led-texans-oust-bengals.html,"HOUSTON — All week, the Houston Texans spoke of momentum as if it were an easily obtained commodity. Arian Foster suggested that the idea of momentum might not even exist, saying each game had its own identity. Perhaps that was the attitude the Texans needed to shake off a late-season slide that cost them a chance at home-field advantage and an opening round bye in the playoffs.After settling for three first-half field goals despite dominating the Cincinnati Bengals, the once-formidable — and 11-1 — Texans appeared primed for an early exit. But buoyed by Foster and a defense that did not allow a touchdown, Houston rediscovered some of its power in a 19-13 victory Saturday in an A.F.C. wild-card game.The Texans advanced to the divisional round for the second year in a row and will play at New England next Sunday. Houston will have a chance to avenge a 42-14 loss to the Patriots on Dec. 10, a rout that began a skid in which the Texans lost three of their last four games.“These guys have stayed the course the whole way,” Texans Coach Gary Kubiak said. “They’ve been through a tough month. The reason we won today is because nobody on this football team panics.”He added, “We had to battle and we had to play our type of game.”The Bengals (10-7) were searching for their first postseason win since the 1990 season, and endured their second consecutive playoff loss to the Texans.Foster rushed for 140 yards on 32 carries and scored Houston’s only touchdown, on a 1-yard run. Foster also became the first player in N.F.L. history to rush for more than 100 yards in the first three playoff games of his career.“I wanted the ball,” Foster said. “That’s what I work for: when it really matters, you’re there for your team and able to make plays.”Matt Schaub was 29 of 38 for 262 yards for Houston, but he threw an interception that was returned for Cincinnati’s only touchdown. Andy Dalton finished 14 of 30 for 127 yards, but the Bengals did not convert a third down in nine tries, and only once drove inside Houston’s 20, reaching the 16. Dalton rarely had time to find his favorite target, A. J. Green, who did not catch a pass in the first half. He finished with five catches for 80 yards.The Texans dominated the first half, but the payoff was three field goals by Shayne Graham and only a 9-7 lead, reflecting their inability to score touchdowns during a late-season slide. Houston finished with a 17-minute edge in time of possession and outgained the Bengals, 420-198, in total yards.Still, Houston managed to turn a statistical blowout into a suspenseful game. Schaub provided the most nerve-racking moment for the record crowd of 71,738 at Reliant Stadium when he threw a short pass on third-and-3 from his 19 to fullback James Casey near the left sideline midway through the second quarter.Cornerback Leon Hall read Schaub’s lapse in judgment perfectly and snared the ball in stride. His 21-yard interception return gave the Bengals a 7-6 lead, presenting another fearful situation for the Texans.“It’s been a gut-check for this organization the past month, and the players led the way,” Kubiak said.Graham had become the Texans’ only reliable weapon during their monthlong fall from the A.F.C.’s top seed to No. 3, kicking 10 field goals in the final three regular-season games. So when the offense could not find the end zone again in the first half, the crowd greeted the decision to use Graham with a mix of boos and shouts to go for it on fourth down.Two of those failed drives ended with fourth-and-3 situations inside Cincinnati’s 10 in the second quarter. The Texans were stopped at the 4 and at the 9, giving Graham easy field goals of 22 and 27 yards. He also had made a 48-yarder in the first quarter after the Texans failed to convert on a third-and-2 play.There were no critical decisions to be questioned in the second half. The Texans drove 51 yards in six plays and scored on Foster’s 1-yard run, taking a 16-7 lead early in the third quarter, before re-establishing a sense of dominance that had been missing.And the Texans earned a chance to redeem themselves at New England.“I wanted another chance to play that game,” defensive end Antonio Smith said. “We just got flat beat. To me, it is a revenge game.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/football/mark-moseley-remains-only-kicker-to-win-nfl-mvp-award.html,"Several players on both sides of the ball are contenders for this season’s Associated Press N.F.L. Most Valuable Player award. No place-kickers are in the discussion, although that has not always been the case. Washington’s Mark Moseley won the honor for the 1982 season.“And I wasn’t even supposed to be on the team that year,” Moseley, 64, said in a recent telephone interview.After finishing 8-8 in Joe Gibbs’s first year as the coach in 1981, the Redskins drafted Dan Miller, a soccer-style kicker out of Miami, in the 11th round. Moseley, a straight-on kicker who entered the league in 1970, was being phased out. But when Miller struggled in the preseason, Moseley reclaimed his position, and Washington won the Super Bowl.Thirty years later, Moseley remains the only kicker to win the A.P.’s award, which dates to 1957. The Professional Football Writers of America began voting for their own M.V.P. in 1975, and took the more conventional route, choosing San Diego quarterback Dan Fouts in 1982.“There were other worthy candidates,” said Len Shapiro, who covered the Redskins for The Washington Post on and off for more than four decades. “Fouts had a great year. Marcus Allen had a great year that year.”Shapiro added that a strange confluence of events had helped Moseley’s case. It was a strike-shortened nine-game season in which the Redskins’ offense kept stalling inside their opponents’ 20. Moseley extended his streak of successful field goals to 23, eclipsing the record then held by Garo Yepremian with 20, and he played a role in winning several close games as Washington went 8-1.In Week 1 in Philadelphia, Moseley hit a 48-yard field goal on the final play of regulation to send the game into overtime, then booted a 26-yard overtime winner. In a Week 6 road game against the St. Louis Cardinals, he scored all of Washington’s points in a 12-7 win. In Week 7 against the Giants — in a snowy game that probably won him the M.V.P. — he broke Yepremian’s record with a 42-yard kick with four seconds left in the fourth quarter to give the Redskins a dramatic 15-14 win. It was his third field goal of the game and also clinched Washington’s first playoff appearance since 1976. His lone miss of the regular season was a 40-yard attempt in the final game against the Cardinals.Moseley converted 20 of his 21 field-goal attempts in 1982, or 95.2 percent, which is now tied for 13th for best single-season percentage. Back then, it was No. 1, which shows how the accuracy of kickers has improved and has perhaps been taken for granted.The interrupted 1982 season made it difficult to gain a clear picture of which players were the most valuable to their team’s season, said Dave Goldberg, who covered the N.F.L. strike for the A.P. in 1982. The N.F.L. played two September games before the two-month strike, then the final seven games.“You have to keep in mind that it was just a nine-game season, so winning a few games looks really, really important,” Goldberg said.Moseley received 35 votes from a nationwide panel of 84 sportswriters and broadcasters, beating Fouts, who earned 33 votes. Fouts, a future Hall of Famer, had a league-high 17 touchdown passes and 2,883 yards passing — numbers that look relatively unimpressive when taken out of context.Bruce Lowitt, who covered the Jets for the A.P. in 1982, was in charge of the voting for the M.V.P. that season, and he said he voted for Moseley.“Other kickers were perhaps as good as Moseley over a period of years, but he just happened to have a spectacular year,” Lowitt said. “But more to the point, his value was in winning those games. There’s a big difference between a player of the year and the most valuable player. Player of the year can be the best running back on a last-place team, but the most valuable has a great influence on a team getting as far as it does.”Goldberg and Shapiro said they did not vote for The A.P.’s 1982 M.V.P. award. Although Shapiro said he would have felt comfortable voting for a kicker, Goldberg said, “I would have had reservations about voting for him.”In 1982, the Redskins had the No. 1 defense in the league. Their offense, which ranked 12th in the regular season, rounded into shape in the playoffs behind running back John Riggins, the Super Bowl M.V.P., and quarterback Joe Theismann, who won the Bert Bell Award as player of the year. Although Moseley made only four of his eight field-goal attempts, the Redskins won each of their four postseason games by 10 points or more, including the Super Bowl over Miami.“I was so fortunate to be with the team I was with,” said Moseley, who lives in Northern Virginia and is the head of franchising for Five Guys. “It just so happened that that year, they really needed someone who was really accurate with kicking, and I don’t know if that’s ever going to happen again in the same way. All the things just fell into place for me that year. Like I said, I wasn’t even supposed to be on that team.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/sports/hockey/us-wins-world-junior-hockey-title.html,"UFA, Russia (AP) — The United States won the world junior hockey championship on Saturday after Rocco Grimaldi scored twice and Vincent Trocheck added an empty-net goal for a 3-1 victory over Sweden in the final.Filip Sandberg put Sweden, the defending champion, ahead on a power play early in the second period, but Grimaldi scored twice in a three-minute span to swing the game in favor of the United States. Grimaldi, a freshman forward for the University of North Dakota team, was chosen by the Florida Panthers in the second round of the 2011 N.H.L. draft.He powered from behind the net to score his first goal, then redirected Jacob Trouba’s slap shot from the blue line midway through the second period.Sweden pulled its goalie for an extra player with 1 minute 42 seconds left but failed to capitalize. Instead, Trocheck scored for the United States with 16.7 seconds left.John Gibson, an Anaheim Ducks draft pick who plays for Kitchener of the Ontario Hockey League, made 26 saves and was named the most valuable player of the tournament. Niklas Lundstrom had 31 saves for Sweden.It was the third title for the United States, which also won in 2004 and 2010.In the bronze medal match, Valeri Nichushkin scored in overtime to give Russia a 6-5 victory over Canada."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/ncaafootball/pete-elliott-football-all-american-and-coach-dies-at-86.html,"Pete Elliott, an all-American back who played on two unbeaten football teams at the University of Michigan in the late 1940s and played or coached in three Rose Bowl games, died on Friday in Canton, Ohio. He was 86.His death was announced by the Pro Football Hall of Fame in Canton, where he was the executive director from 1979 to 1996. The cause was congestive heart failure, his son David said.In addition to being a football star in college, Elliott was an all-Big Ten basketball guard and runner-up for the conference golf championship, playing four seasons in each sport.He and his brother Bump, his Michigan teammate, were elected to the College Football Hall of Fame. They were also coaching rivals in the Big Ten during the 1960s, Pete at Illinois and Bump at Michigan.Playing quarterback, Pete teamed with Bump, a wingback, and the star halfback Bob Chappuis on Michigan’s unbeaten 1947 team, which routed Southern California, 49-0, in the Rose Bowl.That backfield was known as the Mad Magicians for their deceptive plays in Coach Fritz Crisler’s single wing.“It was a tremendous offense,” Bump Elliott said in an interview on Sunday, recalling his brother as “a really good ball-handler” as well as a passer, though he was frequently a blocker.Pete Elliott drew on his golfing skills while in Southern California for the 1948 Rose Bowl game in Pasadena.“Someone arranged for Pete and myself to join Bing Crosby at the Bel-Air Country Club,” Bump said. “Pete was a really good golfer and took a little money from him.”After working as an assistant under Bud Wilkinson at Oklahoma, Pete Elliott was the coach at Nebraska in 1956. He coached at California for the next three seasons and took a team led by quarterback Joe Kapp to the 1959 Rose Bowl, which California lost, 38-12, to Iowa.Elliott bemoaned Iowa’s strong running game. “We didn’t want them to get around us — we worked hard on that, and they didn’t,” he told The Associated Press afterward. “They went inside us instead.”He went on to coach an Illinois team featuring linebacker Dick Butkus, the future Chicago Bears star, to a 17-7 victory over Washington in the 1964 Rose Bowl.After seven seasons at Illinois, Elliott resigned in 1967, together with the head basketball coach, Harry Combes, and his assistant, Howard Braun, following revelations that some football and basketball players had received small but illegal payments from a fund put together by alumni boosters.Elliott was the coach at Miami in Florida in 1973 and 1974 and then served as the university’s athletic director. He oversaw a major expansion of the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1995 as its director.Peter R. Elliott (he had no middle name) was born on Sept. 29, 1926, in Bloomington, Ill., where his father, J. Norman Elliott, was a physician and also played for, and later coached, the Illinois Wesleyan football team.Playing for Michigan from 1945 to 1948, Pete Elliott was named an all-American for his play as a halfback on defense as a senior, when Michigan went undefeated for a second consecutive season and was ranked No. 1 nationally.In addition to his son David and another son, Bruce, both former Michigan football players, and his brothers Bump (whose given name is Chalmers) and James, Pete Elliott is survived by four granddaughters. His wife, Joan, died in 2008.In December 1961, Pete and Bump were guests on “What’s My Line?” — a television game show on which a panel of celebrities tried to guess people’s occupations — signing in as “Peter & Chalmers Elliott.”After the panel figured out they were football-coaching brothers, John Daly, the moderator, asked them, “Does Illinois ever play Michigan?” Informed that it certainly did, Daly said he hoped they played to a tie every year.Bump’s Michigan teams won six times and lost only once to Pete’s Illini. But, Bump said on Sunday, “It wasn’t fun to play against him.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/ncaafootball/murray-staying-at-georgia-for-senior-season.html,"ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray said Sunday night he is returning for his senior season.Murray announced on his Twitter account he won’t leave early to enter the N.F.L. draft.“Blessed to be the QB for the Dawgs, not ready to leave just yet. Time to get back to work & help lead this team to a championship,” Murray said.Murray, a fourth-year junior, already has graduated. He led Georgia to a 12-2 finish that included a loss to Alabama in the Southeastern Conference championship game and a victory over Nebraska in the Capital One Bowl. Murray threw five touchdown passes in the bowl game.Murray is the first quarterback in SEC history to pass for 3,000 yards in three straight seasons. He had 3,898 yards passing this season to set a Georgia record, topping Eric Zeier’s mark of 3,525 in 1993. Murray threw 36 touchdowns passes and only 10 interceptions and leads the nation with a 174.8 passer rating.Another top Georgia junior, linebacker Jarvis Jones, has announced he is entering the NFL draft. While Jones is projected to be a high first-round pick, the forecast for Murray was not as clear. Murray likely would have expected to be selected no higher than the second round.Georgia issued no immediate statement on Murray’s decision.Coach Mark Richt said recently he would support Murray and other juniors no matter their decisions on the draft.“If these guys choose to stay, I’m thrilled obviously, but if they choose to go I’m their No. 1 fan ether way because I just want what’s best for them,” Richt said. “I can’t say what’s best for them. They have to figure out for themselves. They’re grown men now.”Murray’s decision means Georgia’s offense will return almost all of its top starters from a unit that averaged a school-record 37.8 points.Georgia loses senior receivers Tavarres King and Marlon Brown but will return receiver Malcolm Mitchell, tailbacks Todd Gurley and Keith Marshall and all five starting offensive linemen. "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/ncaafootball/in-this-version-rudy-has-a-brother-who-walked-on-too.html,"Miami Gardens, Fla.The father received the text from his son late last winter. It was brief and on point: “How would you feel if I saved you fifty grand?”Patrick Salvi immediately felt like a man of considerable fortune, though the money, while relevant, was not of primary significance.He knew right away what this message from Chris, his fourth-born son of five, meant as he prepared for his fifth-year senior football season at Notre Dame. The improbable ascension, from transfer student to scout team candidate to special-teams walk-on to full scholarship player, was complete.Finally, Chris Salvi was a made man in South Bend, Ind.“The best moment of my life,” he said, sitting in the stands Saturday morning at Sun Life Stadium in a crowd of Notre Dame’s players that included his younger brother, Will, in the run-up to Monday night’s national championship game against Alabama.On second thought, could we please modify that ranking before it found its way into print? There was also a very best moment, Chris decided, and that was the Navy game on Oct. 29, 2011; he was named a co-captain by Coach Brian Kelly, alongside Harrison Smith, a first-round draft pick this season with the Minnesota Vikings.In such company, Chris Salvi believed the distinction best reflected what he had achieved from the day he told his father he wanted to transfer from Butler — a speck on the college football map — to Notre Dame and try out.“You may never see the field again,” Patrick Salvi had said, offering doses of paternal wisdom and caution. Years later — Chris having not only walked on but played on America’s most celebrated gridirons and most of all Notre Dame’s — the father would recall with pride how his son had ignored them.“It’s all been a great joy, but not for any other reason than the recognition of his hard work,” Patrick said.There is no abundance of wide-eyed innocence left in the business of big-time college football. At the level of Alabama, the defending champion, and Notre Dame, the resurrected colossus, the sport is about mammoth television deals, $100 million training facilities and virtual coaching monarchies.On occasion, increasingly rare, intruders infiltrate the armies of four- and five-star recruits. Patrick Salvi and his wife, Lindy, will look for two of them — Chris, No. 24, and Will, No. 36 — when the Irish take the field against the favored Crimson Tide.Having made the practice or scout team under the former coach Charlie Weis, Chris Salvi has been a regular for Kelly on special teams since the 2010 season, best known for taking out two Michigan State players and springing George Atkinson III on an 89-yard kickoff return for a touchdown last year.When the network television announcers made special note of Chris — all 5 feet 10 inches, 190 pounds of him — while dissecting the replay, the Rudy analogy was officially ground into the turf like a defenseless tackling dummy.“At this level, in the real world, Rudy doesn’t get playing time,” Patrick said. “If you can’t block the best athletes from Michigan State and all the others, you can’t play.”It was during the 2010 season that Chris, a safety in high school and at Butler, called to say that he was on the punt-return team and would be making his game debut that weekend at Michigan State. Off to Lansing went the Salvis, where they took seats in the Notre Dame parents’ section. Down the row was Joe Montana, whose son, Nate, was a spare quarterback.“It was a night game, a lot of drinking leading up to it,” Patrick said. “The fans were on Joe so much that he had to get up and leave.”For the Salvis, the experience was as surreal as it was superb. Out of Lake Forest, Ill., the family had long followed Notre Dame football. Patrick is a graduate of the law school. His father went to Notre Dame as well, and so did a brother and a niece and two of his older sons — one currently in law school — before Chris and Will took more circuitous routes.When Chris transferred from Butler, Will began his freshman year at, of all places, Alabama. Two years younger but one grade behind Chris, Will went south looking to break free of the family mold, for a cultural change and winter warmth.“Will wasn’t the same caliber player as Chris in high school,” Patrick said. “He wasn’t thinking about playing college football.”In Alabama, how could he avoid watching? It was the fall of 2009, the season of Mark Ingram and the Heisman Trophy, and Coach Nick Saban’s returning the national title to Tuscaloosa by defeating Texas.In the Rose Bowl stands that day, on a bonding trip, were Patrick and Will, who would soon entertain thoughts of joining his brother in South Bend. He arrived the next fall, intent on studying for a career in politics, spending football Saturdays in the stands with the family.Chris, meanwhile, was building his reputation as an undersize special-teams player of uncommon aggressiveness as well as a slugger of championship renown. He took up boxing and became the 188-pound-division king of Bengal Bouts, the charity boxing tournament that was founded by Knute Rockne in 1920 as a way for football players to stay in shape during the off-season.The competition was eventually opened to the entire student body, but Will said he was content for two years to stick with intramural football, which at Notre Dame is played in full pads.“What they say about us is that Chris is a fighter and I’m a lover,” he said.Still a devotee of football, Will, a cornerback in high school, let Chris talk him into trying out for the practice team for this his senior year. Rudy didn’t get a game-day gold helmet until the end, but Will traveled to Dublin for the season opener against Navy. He dressed for all home games.“Seeing the family waiting for us outside the locker room, knowing what this has meant to them — it’s been amazing,” he said.Until the victories began piling up, little did Will — or anyone, for that matter — imagine a 12-0 regular season and a mind-blowing opportunity for him to be on the field, opposite the disciples of Saban.And so the extended Salvi family gathered in South Florida over the weekend for the climax to its long Notre Dame narrative. Patrick took a deep breath and called it “a great, great ride.” Given the possibility of one well-timed block, Hollywood might call it an ending."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/hockey/nhl-faces-challenges-after-lockout.html,"Sunday morning, the long-dormant N.H.L. began stirring to life. The 113-day lockout was over, finished at 5 a.m. after a grueling 16-hour bargaining session at a Midtown Manhattan hotel, and across North America, the game began to awaken from its slumber.The deal still needed to be ratified by owners and players, a process that could take until Tuesday.But in Dallas, they started putting the ice in at the American Airlines Center. In Ottawa, Prime Minister Stephen Harper called the tentative settlement “great news for hockey fans” and communities across Canada. “So pumped,” Rangers defenseman Stu Bickel said on his Twitter account.Rangers goalie Henrik Lundqvist sent out the message: “The past is the past ... let’s move forward and start enjoying the best game on the planet!! Hockey is back and I love it!!!”But the past Lundqvist referred to clouds Sunday’s euphoria. Fans might not be ready to move forward just yet — there is certain to be lingering anger at the N.H.L. as it picks itself up from another crippling lockout.Confronted by a host of challenges, both on and off the ice, how does the league move ahead in the truncated season to come, and beyond?This was the third lockout in Gary Bettman’s 20 years as the commissioner. About 10 percent of all the regular-season games scheduled during his tenure have been canceled. The league came close to losing the entire season, as it lost the 2004-5 season, and once again it has alienated fans and business partners.The N.H.L. generated a league-record $3.3 billion in revenue last season, and it gave up about $1 billion to get a deal that reduced the players’ share of the earnings from 57 percent to 50 percent, similar to what N.F.L. and N.B.A. owners forced players to accept in recent lockouts. In monetary terms, that will pay off for the N.H.L. owners after perhaps three years of the new 10-year deal.But it could be costlier in other ways. The owners’ hard-line demands helped generate an atmosphere of mistrust between the players and the league. Donald Fehr, the union’s executive director, negotiated Saturday and Sunday while wielding the explicit threat of dissolving the union and throwing the lockout into court on antitrust grounds.“It was concessionary bargaining right from the beginning,” a resigned Shane Doan of the Phoenix Coyotes said after the negotiating was done. “As much as we didn’t want that, we understand that the nature of professional sports has kind of changed in the last couple C.B.A.’s in football, basketball and obviously hockey.”There were other costs.Kraft Foods walked away from a lucrative N.H.L. sponsorship in Canada. Molson Coors is seeking reparations for lost business. The Winter Classic, the league’s biggest marketing tool, was canceled. A Facebook page started by an angry Los Angeles fan calling for a 10-game boycott on N.H.L. tickets and merchandise, called “Just Drop It,” generated more than 21,000 “likes.”“The damage from this lockout is deep,” said Brian Cooper, president of the Toronto sports management company S&E Sponsorship Group. “From the research I saw and what I heard anecdotally, a lot of fans and sponsors may not re-engage this season. The league is going to have to slowly win back their hearts and minds.”One way to do that is to avoid future lockouts. The length of the collective bargaining agreement awaiting ratification — 10 years, with an opt-out clause after eight — assures labor peace until 2019-20. That could be enough time to allow sponsors and fans to move past what happened this season, just as revenue grew at an increasing rate in the years after the 2004-5 lockout.In 2005-6, the league was widely ridiculed for having “Thank You Fans!” written on the ice surface of every N.H.L. rink. Attendance held steady, and it is expected to hold steady this time as well in Canada and in Detroit, Pittsburgh, New York and other traditional hockey cities in the United States.But for money-losing teams in places where hockey was often an afterthought to begin with, like Florida, Columbus and Phoenix, attendance might drop. In large part, Bettman persisted in this lockout on behalf of such floundering teams, throwing them lifelines of lower payroll and increased revenue-sharing.“I’m hoping that our fans understand this was something that had to be done for the strength of the league, for the strength of the players association,” Ed Snider, the Flyers’ owner, told The Associated Press. “I hope they don’t hold it against us.”On the ice, players and coaches face the challenge of a shortened season, with a 48- or 50-game schedule planned.The last time there was a lockout-shortened schedule, in 1994-95, play bogged down as rusty teams found it easier to defend than to attack. Average scoring dropped by nearly half a goal per game, ushering in several years of dull hockey.But the short schedule heightened the importance of every game. Last month, Cam Neely, the Bruins’ president, remembered the 1994-95 season as “a sprint toward the playoffs” and looked ahead to a shortened 2012-13 schedule that would be “fast and furious.”Some players will start the coming season fresh from play in Europe or in the American Hockey League. Others have been doing little more than daily skatearounds. Still others are injured, like the Devils’ Adam Henrique, who has a broken thumb sustained in an A.H.L. game and will miss another month.Coaches like the Rangers’ John Tortorella are eager to get started. But until the contract is ratified, the lockout rules remain in force. On Monday morning, some Rangers players will skate at the team’s practice rink; Tortorella will be there, but he cannot speak with them.For all the challenges the N.H.L. faces, perhaps the best thing it has going for it is the enthusiasm of its players.“I’m really gratified that we’re starting again,” defenseman Ryan McDonagh said by e-mail as he prepared to rejoin the Rangers. “I’m excited to join my teammates again on the ice and compete playing the game I love.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/football/eagles-expand-search-for-coach.html,"PHILADELPHIA (AP) — The Philadelphia Eagles took their coaching search to Denver to interview Broncos offensive coordinator Mike McCoy on Sunday after a lengthy meeting with Oregon coach Chip Kelly a night earlier in Arizona.The Eagles only confirmed their meeting with Kelly after it ended. A person familiar with the situation said Kelly was nearing a deal with the Cleveland Browns on Friday before he went ahead with his scheduled meeting with the Eagles on Saturday afternoon.Kelly’s interview with the Eagles lasted several hours, said the person, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the information was not authorized for release.Kelly also met with Buffalo after his first meeting with Cleveland. It appears his choice is down to the Eagles or returning to Oregon. Kelly nearly accepted a job with Tampa Bay last year before staying put.Meanwhile, the Eagles didn’t wait around.Owner Jeffrey Lurie, general manager Howie Roseman and team president Don Smolenski left Arizona for Denver on Sunday to continue the search to replace Andy Reid, who was fired after 14 seasons.They met with McCoy for a few hours and then headed back to Philadelphia. The Eagles plan to interview Indianapolis offensive coordinator Bruce Arians and Seattle defensive coordinator Gus Bradley this week.The 40-year-old McCoy engineered an offense around quarterback Peyton Manning this season. Denver went 13-3, secured the No. 1 seed in the AFC, and has a bye this weekend. The Broncos ranked fourth in the league in total offense and second in scoring.McCoy has been successful working with quarterbacks far less talented than Manning. Jake Delhomme went to the Pro Bowl in 2005 when McCoy was Carolina’s quarterbacks coach. Kyle Orton had his two best seasons in Denver in 2009-10 under McCoy’s tutelage. In 2011, McCoy devised an offensive system around Tim Tebow’s skills and the Broncos won a playoff game.Philadelphia requested permission to interview Cincinnati offensive coordinator Jay Gruden, but the Bengals have yet to grant permission.The Eagles interviewed Penn State’s Bill O’Brien on Thursday and met with Atlanta Falcons defensive coordinator Mike Nolan and special teams coordinator Keith Armstrong on Wednesday. O’Brien is remaining at Penn State.Syracuse’s Doug Marrone was on Philadelphia’s list, but he’s set to take over at Buffalo for Chan Gailey.The pursuit of Kelly had a soap-opera element because Browns CEO Joe Banner spent the previous 19 seasons in Philadelphia, serving the last 12 as president. Banner and Lurie are longtime friends since childhood. But Banner was forced out of the organization in a power struggle with Roseman and Reid.Banner had a knack for rubbing people the wrong away in Philadelphia, and wasn’t popular in the locker room because of the way he handled contract negotiations. It’s unknown whether his reputation was a factor in Kelly’s decision not to accept Cleveland’s offer. "

But even Piazza managed just 63 percent, perhaps a reflection of the skepticism surrounding him. Candidates need 75 percent to be elected.Historically, this has not been easy. In 1971, when Yogi Berra made his debut on the ballot, he collected only two-thirds of the vote. That’s right — 118 of 360 writers did not vote for Berra as soon as they had the chance. Fifteen players on that 1971 ballot eventually made it to Cooperstown, but that year, the voters could not reach a three-quarters consensus on any of them.Since then, only one other writers’ ballot has produced no new inductees. That was in 1996, when Phil Niekro, Tony Perez and Don Sutton got more than 60 percent but less than 75. They and three others from that ballot — Ron Santo, Jim Rice and Bruce Sutter — eventually elbowed through the crowd and into the Hall.What makes this new ballot so intriguing, of course, is the presence of Bonds and Clemens, and the sad referendum voters are likely to send on their legacies. The writers have bestowed more single-season honors on Bonds and Clemens than they have on any other player; seven Most Valuable Player awards for Bonds, and seven Cy Young Awards, and an M.V.P. for Clemens.But the ultimate honor will have to wait, if it ever comes. Too many voters have prioritized the character clause in the voting guidelines over recognizing the achievements we all witnessed. That is their right, of course, and a lot of fans and former players agree.We know steroids mutated the records. What we do not know, and never can, is the full roster of players who used performance-enhancing drugs, including when they started and when they stopped. Punishing only those who were caught (with varying degrees of evidence) while rewarding those who got away with it seems like willful ignorance of the depth of the problem.I did not send in my ballot, because The New York Times does not permit voting for awards. The rationale is that reporters should cover the news, not make it. If indeed no players are elected this week, the writers, and our unwieldy election process, will be the story. That is a shame, because the focus should always be on the candidates, and their on-field worthiness for enshrinement. If you consider only what we saw on the field, the ballot is dazzling. Yet even the players free of steroid suspicion seem unlikely to reach 75 percent.Craig Biggio combined longevity and excellence with a set of skills matched by few others. How many players reached 3,000 hits — including 1,000 extra-base hits — while stealing 400 bases? Just three: Ty Cobb, Tris Speaker and Biggio. Cobb and Speaker last played in 1928.Biggio, however, is perceived by some to have been less than dominant. He never led his league in hits, batting average, on-base percentage or slugging percentage, and he batted .234 in the postseason. Yet another candidate who was dominant, and sparkled in October, seems even less likely than Biggio to make it on Wednesday.He is Curt Schilling, who had about eight extraordinary seasons and a handful of others just a notch below. His regular-season record (216-146, with a 3.46 earned run average) belies his postseason brilliance (11-2, 2.23), and he is the only pitcher in history to record at least 3,000 strikeouts with fewer than 750 walks.Like all players of their generation, Biggio and Schilling were not tested for steroids until 2003. We cannot say for sure they were clean, but most writers seem to assume they were. Yet they still will not convince many voters.At least two voters have said they submitted ballots with only one name checked — that of Jack Morris, a worthy candidate but one whose credentials fall short of Biggio’s or Schilling’s. Another writer handed in a blank ballot in protest. Another said he generally does not vote for anybody on the first ballot, a completely indefensible position, even if it is rooted in history.After all, 23 lunkheads left Willie Mays off their ballot. Forty-three did not vote for Mickey Mantle. Sixteen did not vote for Mike Schmidt. Even Tom Seaver, whose percentage of 98.8 is the highest in history, was deemed unworthy by five curmudgeons.Maybe Morris will make it, in his 14th appearance on the ballot, after collecting 66.7 percent last year. His election is long overdue, although he will not receive a final push from the bloc of analysts who rightly lobbied for Bert Blyleven two years ago. Morris’s 3.90 E.R.A. would be the highest in the Hall.If Biggio, Schilling and Morris are made to wait — to say nothing of Bonds, Clemens, Sosa, Piazza, Jeff Bagwell, Tim Raines and others — there will still be an induction ceremony in Cooperstown this summer. In December, the veterans committee elected Hank O’Day, Jacob Ruppert and Deacon White to the Hall of Fame. All three died in the 1930s."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/football/seahawks-marshawn-lynch-atones-for-fumble-with-decisive-touchdown.html,"LANDOVER, Md. — Marshawn Lynch was the N.F.L.’s third-leading rusher this season, but he was only a shade more than an afterthought in the frenzied weeklong buildup to Sunday’s N.F.C. wild-card game at FedEx Field between the Seattle Seahawks and the Washington Redskins.With the spotlight squarely focused on the rookie quarterbacks Robert Griffin III and Russell Wilson, Lynch found himself buried on the undercard. It was an anomaly, considering that Lynch, a running back with the power of a sport-utility vehicle and the shifty moves of a ballroom dancer, had amassed 1,590 rushing yards for the Seahawks during the regular season.A sixth-year veteran, Lynch seemed content with his understated role for much of the game — and even afterward, when he declined to be interviewed. Yet he made sure to leave his mark.Midway through the fourth quarter, Lynch took a handoff from Wilson and rumbled to his right, all sorts of space opening before him. Using one final block from his quarterback, Lynch scored on a 27-yard run for the go-ahead touchdown in Seattle’s 24-14 victory. The play was the tipping point in a tight game, and it also helped Lynch atone for a third-quarter fumble that probably cost his team a touchdown.Referring to that miscue, Seahawks wide receiver Golden Tate said: “I was more worried about the other team: how are you going to stop this guy? I know he’s about to be ready to throw down.”Lynch carried the ball 20 times for 132 yards, a stalwart effort as Seattle secured a spot in an N.F.C. divisional round game against the Atlanta Falcons on Sunday. At his locker after the game, Lynch pulled on a gray sweatshirt, donned a pair of red-framed sunglasses (at night) and eluded several reporters as he made a beeline to the door. In a way, it was fitting. On Sunday, nobody could stop him.His counterpart, Redskins running back Alfred Morris, finished with 80 yards on 16 carries.Seattle was trailing, 14-3, before Lynch found his familiar rhythm in the second quarter. When Wilson fumbled near midfield, Lynch scooped up the ball and broke free for 20 yards, helping to set up Seattle’s first touchdown. “I think that was one of the biggest plays of the game,” Wilson said.Lynch kept things going on his team’s opening possession of the second half, rushing for 26 and 15 yards and eventually putting the ball just short of the goal line. It was no secret that Wilson would continue to feed Lynch, and for good reason. And then trouble. As Lynch took a handoff on second-and-goal from the Washington 1-yard line, linebacker London Fletcher reached out to punch the ball free. Washington recovered the fumble.Lynch slammed his right fist against the turf. It was an uncharacteristic blunder.“He didn’t look happy,” tight end Zach Miller said. “I was starting to pity the guys he was going to run against, because I knew he was going to take it out on them.”Lynch’s touchdown run in the fourth quarter turned FedEx Field into a mausoleum.Morris did what he could for the Redskins. After Griffin appeared to aggravate a right-knee injury in the first quarter, it was clear that Morris would need to replicate his performance from a week ago, when he rushed for 200 yards in the Redskins’ must-win regular-season finale against the Dallas Cowboys.Against Seattle, Morris piled up 60 yards on 11 carries in the first half, which was pretty much business as usual. Morris, a rookie, was the league’s second-leading rusher. But he got little help Sunday, and he rushed just five times in the second half — a quiet end to a big season."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/football/poignant-day-for-ray-lewis-the-face-of-a-franchise.html,"BALTIMORE — The number 52 blinked on the video board Sunday as linebacker Ray Lewis was sent onto the field to be part of the Baltimore Ravens’ victory formation. The number remained there long after a triumphant lap around M&T Bank Stadium.To fans in Baltimore, and throughout the N.F.L., those white digits signify so much and always will. Frenzied, chest-beating entrances. Inspirational speeches. Punishing tackles. Game-changing turnovers. One of the finest careers for any linebacker in any era.And those numbers ultimately stood for the end as Lewis neared the close of an illustrious 17-year career by contributing to a staunch defensive performance that helped Baltimore to a 24-9 victory against the Indianapolis Colts in his final home game.“I was in one of those moments where I just wanted to appreciate the ride,” said Lewis, 37, who told teammates Wednesday that he was ready to move on after 13 Pro Bowl selections, 2 awards for defensive player of the year, and the distinction of being the most valuable player in Baltimore’s 34-7 domination of the Giants in the Super Bowl to cap the 2000 season.His farewell will be remembered by the announced crowd of 71,379 long after details of a season that has often been a defensive struggle for Baltimore are forgotten.“There were tears, and I’m trying to hold it in myself because I’m playing a game,” Lewis said.John Harbaugh, the ever-intense coach of the Ravens, the A.F.C. North champions, could not help being swept up in the atmosphere.“You feel it right in here,” he said. “You feel it right at your core. I know the people in Baltimore feel that way.”As always, Lewis produced. He had a game-high 13 tackles, 9 of them unassisted, despite playing with his right arm in a heavy brace in his first action since he tore his triceps on Oct. 14, forcing a 10-game absence.“My total focus today was to come in and play my heart out and get my team a win,” Lewis said. “Everything else just came with it. There was probably no greater moment than seeing my kids, my mom, my dad, my family right there in the end of the end zone. That was probably when I lost it emotionally, because I knew that everything I have always done has always been for them.”Teammates said Lewis’s return — and the now-or-never urgency his announcement created — caused them to raise their level after four losses in their last five games in a 10-6 regular season.“He said this is his last ride,” running back Ray Rice said. “Everybody has no choice but to give it their all for him.”Although the Ravens bent, allowing Indianapolis to accumulate 419 net yards, including 152 rushing, they did not break. The Colts were unable to produce a touchdown in three tries in the red zone. Their only points came on field goals of 47, 52 and 26 yards from Adam Vinatieri.“We wanted to make sure tackles and not allow any big plays,” cornerback Corey Graham said. “We knew if we did not allow any big plays, we would win the game.”That formula was hard to find during the regular season. With safety Ed Reed and cornerback Cary Williams the only defenders healthy enough to play every game, 24 players made at least one start. The lack of continuity factored into a unit that allowed 21.5 points a game, tied for 12th in the N.F.L. Those woes included a 34-17 loss to Denver, a pounding that will not be forgotten when Ravens visit the Broncos on Saturday.“We saw them earlier in the year, but now we get them again with all our guys back,” said Lewis, eager to extend his last ride to the Super Bowl in New Orleans. “We are really looking forward to it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/ncaafootball/in-their-nightmares-notre-dame-fans-will-see-42-in-red.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The Notre Dame Golden Domers had waited 24 years, and then the better part of six weeks, to flock here in anticipation of cheering their team onto a national title. Instead they sat with their arms folded, their caps lowered, slouched in their seats, despondent.They can thank Eddie Lacy for that.He ran at will, through arm tackles, over defenders, past Manti Te’o. Lacy made it look easy as he knifed through Notre Dame’s defense making certain the Fighting Irish would not go through Alabama, at least not this year, to win their first national championship since 1988.Like Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson before him, Lacy had his night atop college football as Alabama’s lead running back. Lacy made this title game his own, racking up 140 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving as the Crimson Tide rolled to a 42-14 victory that left Notre Dame spinning from the start and sealed the Tide’s third title in four years.Lacy wasted no time in keeping the Irish off balance, scoring on a 20-yard run on the Tide’s first possession of the game to set the tone.He then he caught a short pass in the red zone, spun tightly enough around two defenders to escape another converging attacker and scored with 31 seconds left in the first half. That touchdown put Alabama ahead, 28-0, and left Notre Dame wondering what it could do to stop him.Lacy said he was surprised with how easily he could run on the Irish defense.“Nobody would have expected that on this stage,” Lacy said. “But once you exploit it, you don't have a choice but to run with it.”He seemed to favor the left side of his offensive line, barreling behind the 311-pound left tackle, Cyrus Kouandjio, and his 320-pound left guard, Chance Warmack. Behind them, he finished the Crimson Tide’s opening drive with his 20-yard touchdown, clean up the gut, defenders diving at his ankles.The Notre Dame defense had not allowed a touchdown in the first quarter all season. By the end of the quarter, Lacy had 72 yards, averaging 9 yards a carry, and Alabama had outgained Notre Dame in total yardage by 202-23. Alabama led, 14-0, and it would soon be 21-0, then 28-0, then more and more.“Eddie’s always at his best, man,” guard Chance Warmack said. “He was feeling it just like everybody else was. We all had a mentality tonight to not be denied.”The Notre Dame defense that had won 12 games, that had allowed just 10.3 points per game, had already failed. Louis Nix III and Stephon Tuitt had been moved. Te’o, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, had been a nonfactor. If that ever seemed plausible, on this night, it was. Not even he could slow Lacy and Alabama by himself.With Lacy in his backfield, Alabama quarterback A J McCarron simply needed to fake handoffs to find his receivers open deep downfield. There, Kevin Norwood and Amari Cooper found themselves a step ahead, the Fighting Irish two steps behind.“It was kind of easy because they were so predictable,” said lineman D. J. Fluker, adding, “They ran the same things they did on film.”McCarron, who has won two titles now with the help of a healthy run game, threw four touchdown passes. Cooper, whose freshman season rivaled that of T. J. Yeldon, had 105 yards and 2 touchdowns. Yeldon, whose job was to spell Lacy, kept punishing Notre Dame, for 108 yards and his own touchdown."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/best-advice-think-twice-about-that-nfl-job.html,"As college football’s national championship game gets ready to kick off Monday night, you will hear ad nauseam about the two coaches, including why they will, or won’t, and should, or shouldn’t, parlay their big moment into a stab at an N.F.L. job — and in Nick Saban’s case another stab at an N.F.L. job, even though he may still be bleeding from the last one. But if Saban or Notre Dame’s Brian Kelly needs any further confirmation of why this is a bad idea — and they shouldn’t: even Chip Kelly is apparently choosing an N.C.A.A. gangplank at Oregon instead of an N.F.L. job — they need only to have watched Sunday night’s fiasco involving Redskins Coach Mike Shanahan and the latest, most egregious example of how N.F.L. coaching makes you lose your mind.For three quarters of a playoff loss to the Seahawks, Shanahan watched quarterback Robert Griffin III hobble on an injured knee while Shanahan convinced himself that this was a winning strategy. While the Redskins led, 14-0, there was a shred of logic to mortgaging the franchise’s future for a chance at a playoff victory. Hey, this is the win-now-or-else league. But as Griffin struggled, his magic evaporating with every weakening step, Shanahan kept doubling down on the mortgage. It was no longer a matter of whether it would end badly, but just how badly. One gruesome knee twist later, only the magnetic resonance imaging test will tell.As Thomas Boswell writes in The Washington Post, this is the emergency room culture of the N.F.L. at work. Never mind that Griffin was clearly not leading the Redskins anywhere after the first quarter and an able backup, Kirk Cousins, was available, Griffin was still standing and insisting he was just as effective as always. That Shanahan believed that instead of his own eyes was his colossal failure, writes Dan Wetzel on Yahoo.com, and as Dan Graziano points out on ESPN.com this was not a momentary snap decision gone wrong, but one that played out for an agonizingly long time, while Shanahan refused to overrule his delusional star player, Mike Freeman writes on CBSSports.com. The face of the Redskins’ fans horrified at Griffin writhing on the turf said it all: We wanted to watch this guy perform miracles for many, many seasons, not watch him sacrificed by a coach who has not won a playoff game for a very long time.The immediate result is the Seahawks move on, leaving Russell Wilson as the lone rookie superstar quarterback to escape the first weekend, as Les Carpenter writes on Yahoo.com, and Seattle looking fearless in its first road playoff victory since 1983, Jerry Brewer writes in The Seattle Times. They joined the Ravens in Sunday’s win column. Baltimore dispatched the Colts and their superstar rookie Andrew Luck and gained their much-desired rematch with the Broncos, Clark Judge writes on CBSSports.com.This leaves the stage now to the college football finale, the big clash between Alabama and Notre Dame that mercifully ends a seemingly endless bowl season. It has been so long since they last played that the pregame player features — like the profile of Alabama’s invaluable linebacker C.J. Mosley by SI.com’s Stewart Mandel — serve as helpful reminders of who plays for these teams. We have not forgotten who coaches either of them, such being the elevated status of the college coach, and Tony Barnhart argues on CBSSports.com that this season qualifies as Saban’s best coaching job. Herb Gould argues in The Chicago Sun-Times that Kelly might just be Saban’s equal, and Pat Forde writes on Yahoo.com that either of them would be nuts to trade in his cushy throne for the bed of nails that is an N.F.L. job.Hockey would like to interrupt all this obsession with football coaches with the news that it ended its disastrous lockout, but used its usual level of public-relations brilliance to do so on a weekend when they could manage only “oh, by the way” status. Perhaps it is better that way, because fans hardly need reminding how inane this was and the N.H.L. would be wise to get out of the way as much as possible and hope its fans’ love of hockey has not soured completely, Scott Burnside writes on ESPN.com. Almost everyone assumes the fans will eventually slink back to their ridiculously expensive seats, but that does not mean the damage to the league has not been done, Bruce Arthur writes in The National Post. The only way this becomes a net-positive, Jeff Blair argues in The Globe and Mail, is if the N.H.L. finally shoves aside Commissioner Gary Bettman and his deputy in labor disasters Bill Daly.That, however, will require logic and clear thinking by N.H.L. owners, and their history looks a lot like Mike Shanahan’s coaching performance Sunday night: lots of fiddling while the empire burns.Follow Leading Off on Twitter: twitter.com/zinsernyt"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/ncaafootball/irishs-teo-and-golson-share-a-number-and-the-spotlight.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — Manti Te’o was 5, on a drive around his hometown, Laie, Hawaii, when his father turned to him and asked, “Son, when you play football, what number do you want to be?”The number he chose would be with him for the rest of his career. It would be his little tradition. Since he was 5 years old, Te’o picked No. 5.Everett Golson was a fan of Donovan McNabb. He thought he played like McNabb, or at least tried to. So in high school, he wore McNabb’s No. 5. It became his No. 5.It is not uncommon in college football, with rosters easily exceeding 100, for two players on the same team to wear the same number, one on offense and the other on defense. It is rare that those two players are the stars, the starting quarterback (Golson) and the Heisman-finalist linebacker (Te’o), for a team playing for a national championship, as Notre Dame did against Alabama on Monday night.Te’o calls Golson Little Five. And Golson calls Te’o Big Five.To tell their jerseys apart, because Notre Dame players historically do not have their names on the back, an identification number is printed inside. That number appears inside their pads, their shoes, their game pants, their undershirts, their laundry cubbies, everything, said Ryan Grooms, the head equipment manager. Essentially, it is the players’ out-of-sight number.To Grooms, Te’o is No. 5, and Golson is No. 101.That number is based on seniority. For two years, while Armando Allen wore No. 5 at running back, Te’o was No. 101. He, too, had to wait.Te’o is now the unquestioned leader. Golson, the novice quarterback.Both just happen to prefer No. 5. For Monday’s championship game, there were seven backup No. 5 jerseys on the sideline, four for Te’o and three for Golson. Since their positions are physically taxing, their jerseys are more prone to rips and tears. Te’o alone went through eight or nine jerseys this season, Grooms said.Because Golson plays quarterback, Grooms never worries that he and Te’o will be on the field at the same time. If two players with the same number are on the field at the same time, it is a 5-yard penalty. That is up to the coaches to monitor, specifically Scott Booker, the special-teams coordinator. Such a penalty almost cost Notre Dame its unbeaten record in November.Cornerback Bennett Jackson and receiver Chris Brown, who both wear No. 2, were on the field for a rare field-goal block formation when Pittsburgh missed a 33-yard attempt in the second overtime period that would have given the Irish their only loss.No penalty was called, however, and Notre Dame went on to win the game.All season, Te’o had directed the defense, the unquestioned leader of the team. He mostly left Golson alone to quarterback the offense, except for those times when Golson was benched, injured or discouraged.“I try to give him his space,” Te’o said, adding, “But when I feel that he needs some motivation, if he needs somebody to pick him up, I can kind of sense that with him.”In those low moments, Te’o said he told Golson that he loved him.Golson distinctly remembered a moment at halftime of the Oklahoma game, when Te’o approached him and said, “Whatever you do, we got you.”In the second half, Golson played as well as he did all season. He passed for 122 yards, including a 50-yard completion to Brown in the fourth quarter when the score was tied, and ran for 40 yards and a touchdown. After Big Five spoke with Little Five, Notre Dame outscored then-No. 8 Oklahoma, 20-6, and cemented its standing as a championship contender.Te’o’s Heisman Trophy campaign gained momentum, and Golson gained confidence. Coach Brian Kelly would say the Fighting Irish would not have played for the national championship without Little Five. And Big Five’s image would be transcendent for an inside linebacker, even for Notre Dame.The pressure weighed on him, Te’o said, being on that “mantle.”Next year, Golson may assume that role.“For the past year, I’ve just been grateful to be placed with that responsibility,” Te’o said. “And I’m sure that if it is placed on Everett, he’ll do a great job.”After the championship game, Golson will no longer be No. 101.“Hopefully, when he leaves, I’ll be Big Five,” Golson said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/football/robert-griffin-iiis-knee-to-be-examined-further-shanahan-says.html,"For most coaches in the N.F.L., what ultimately defines them is the difference between winning and losing. For Washington Redskins Coach Mike Shanahan, however, that age-old distinction has suddenly been surpassed in importance by a new concern: the difference between being injured and being hurt.That gray-area issue continued to hang over Shanahan and his team Monday as the status of quarterback Robert Griffin III remained unclear. Yes, the Redskins’ playing season ended Sunday in a wild-card round loss to Seattle, but a season of spirited speculation — and second-guessing — seems certain to continue for the foreseeable future.Shanahan revealed Monday that Griffin, who played nearly all of Sunday’s game with an injured right knee, would be examined Tuesday by Dr. James Andrews, the renowned orthopedist. Shanahan added that while Griffin had already had a magnetic resonance imaging exam on his knee, the results were inconclusive in terms of identifying a new injury because Griffin had previously injured the same knee.Griffin tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee in 2009 while at Baylor, and the obvious fear for the Redskins is that he has sustained a similar injury, which would almost surely keep him from playing a full season in 2013.“Any time there are old injuries, you need to do a physical exam,” Shanahan told reporters during his season-ending news conference at the team’s training site in Ashburn, Va. Shanahan did his best to avoid speculating on any potential prognosis but conceded that “there is a concern” about Griffin’s status.“When I find out the extent of it, I’ll let you know,” he said.Griffin was not available to reporters Monday, though he did post a few messages to his Twitter account in which he defended his desire to remain in Sunday’s game as well as Shanahan’s decision to allow him to do so.“When adversity strikes you respond in one of two ways,” Griffin wrote on Twitter. “You step aside and give in. Or you step up and fight.”He also wrote: “Many may question, criticize & think they have all the right answers. But few have been in the line of fire in battle.”Pithy statements notwithstanding, the wait for clarity on Griffin’s situation figures to be excruciating for everyone connected to the Redskins, since Griffin emerged this season as the team’s long-term standard-bearer. Griffin’s exciting style and ability to run as well as pass energized the team’s fans and propelled the Redskins to their first N.F.C. East title since 1999.But Griffin strained the lateral collateral ligament in his knee in a Dec. 9 game against the Baltimore Ravens. Though he returned to the field for several plays shortly after getting hurt — a sequence that has also received considerable criticism for its handling — he then sat out a game in which the backup Kirk Cousins helped Washington beat the Cleveland Browns.Cousins’s solid play in that game was one reason the focus on Shanahan’s decision Sunday was so intense. Another was a basic visual test: Griffin aggravated his knee late in the first quarter, and from that point forward, he was clearly restricted. On one fourth-quarter running play, he jogged — as best he could — toward the left sideline, seemingly yanking along his right leg as he went. Washington did not score in the final three quarters, and Griffin recorded only 16 passing yards and 9 rushing yards after being reinjured.Shanahan finally pulled Griffin with about six minutes left after he crumpled to the turf trying to pick up a bad snap. At that point, there was little choice — Griffin did not move to recover the fumble once he toppled — and even Shanahan acknowledged that he would probably second-guess himself for leaving Griffin on the field as long as he had.If Shanahan does, he will hardly be alone. His decision was a hotly debated topic across a variety of spheres Monday, with many observers on social media, radio and television wondering if Shanahan lent too much weight to Griffin’s impassioned in-game argument that while his knee was surely hurting, he was not truly injured.That distinction — between being hurt and injured — was the core of Griffin’s case to Shanahan, according to the coach, and Griffin’s teammates generally seemed to understand it.“I think for Coach Shanahan, he has to listen to the player in this situation,” the veteran linebacker London Fletcher said. “When you’re talking about a franchise quarterback who has made so many plays to get you to this point, and the player tells you he can go, you have to let him go. This is the playoffs. This is a do-or-die situation.”Unfortunately for the Redskins, Shanahan’s decision appeared to backfire — Seattle scored 24 unanswered points to beat Washington, 24-14 — and now the Redskins must wait to find out just how injured their franchise quarterback is. Shanahan answered questions on several other topics Monday, including a query on the seemingly poor condition of the turf at FedEx Field on Sunday (Seattle Coach Pete Carroll criticized the surface), but the Redskins’ focus was clearly on Griffin.“I’m concerned,” receiver Santana Moss told reporters. “I’m just hoping it’s nothing major and he’ll have the time to heal up.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/ncaafootball/alabama-routs-notre-dame-in-title-game.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — They called the football game played here Monday night a national championship, a title clash for the ages, epic, monumental, historic.Then Notre Dame kicked the ball off.Then Alabama drove down the field, unimpeded, as if out for a nighttime stroll. It all went downhill from there, for Notre Dame and for those interested in the most overhyped college football game in years. Instead, this national championship ended early, almost immediately, in a flurry of Alabama touchdowns that allowed the Crimson Tide to seize their third title in four seasons, 42-14, with all the ease predicted by the oddsmakers, sapping this game of all competitiveness or drama.This was “Rudy,” the sequel, after he stumbled onto Elm Street.Alabama jumped to a 14-0 lead after one quarter and opened up a 28-0 advantage by the half, as Notre Dame fans streamed for the exits and the beer lines. Afterward, Alabama fans held newspapers with the headline “BAMA! AGAIN!” and chanted “S!E!C!”, as defensive lineman Quinton Dial grabbed the school flag from a cheerleader and sprinted across the end zone.The game itself brought to mind a famous quote from Mike Tyson. Everybody has a plan, he said — until getting punched in the face. On Monday, Alabama bludgeoned Notre Dame, repeatedly. It controlled the game with both lines, on offense and defense, putting on a clinic in power football. It ran all over a defense known for its ability to stop the run. Alabama (13-1) so dominated that it reminded sports fans that N.B.A. games were also available for viewing Monday night, and that Notre Dame’s best chance for a national title is now in women’s basketball.This only strengthened the claim few at Alabama dared to make before Monday night: that Coach Nick Saban, who flopped in two forgettable seasons on this very field at Sun Life Stadium as coach of the Miami Dolphins, has created a college football dynasty. This was his fourth national championship and third since he left the Dolphins to return to college football at Alabama. One could easily argue it was also his most impressive.In the locker room, surrounded by the teammates in gray championship hats and T-shirts, linebacker Nico Johnson blurted out words that only a senior could. For the underclassmen, Saban continued to ban the d-word. “OK, I can say it now,” Johnson said. “This is a dynasty.”Only two other college coaches can claim at least four titles. One is John McKay of Southern California. The other is Paul Bryant, the coach known as Bear who made Alabama football famous.Now there is Saban, a coach who must contend with fewer scholarships than afforded coaches from the Bryant era and who faces far stiffer competition. Yet despite those limitations, Saban runs a program that resembles a 33rd N.F.L. team as closely as a college football powerhouse. This season, despite a close loss to Texas A&M, only reinforced that notion.Saban spent all of last week scoffing at any comparison between himself and Bryant, and this from a man with a 9-foot-tall statue of himself outside his office. Those close to him knew what another championship meant. “There’s no question,” said Kirby Smart, his defensive coordinator. “There’s no question he is driven to be the greatest coach in the game.”Monday was another step, for Saban’s legacy and for Alabama’s program and for the Southeastern Conference, from which a team secured the national championship for the seventh straight season. As “Sweet Home Alabama” predictably blasted from the stadium speakers — Roll! Tide! Roll! — Mike Slive, the conference commissioner dodged confetti and smiled a smile that seemed to stretch from here to South Beach.“You don’t see something like this coming,” he said. “One can enjoy it. But one cannot anticipate it.”The suspense this year ended almost immediately. Almost. Notre Dame (12-1) stuffed the Crimson Tide on their first play from scrimmage. On the next snap, quarterback A J McCarron found receiver Kevin Norwood for a 29-yard gain. Notre Dame compounded that with a face mask penalty, then compounded that with a defensive offsides. Its vaunted defense, led by linebacker Manti Te’o, was generally ineffective.Running back Eddie Lacy finished off the drive with a 20-yard scamper into the end zone, his path largely unchallenged, his body largely untouched. It was the first time this season Notre Dame allowed a touchdown in the first quarter. The 82-yard drive was also the longest this year against the Fighting Irish.The worst start Notre Dame could have imagined only worsened from that point. Officials ruled a completion incomplete that would have gone for a first down, and when the Irish appeared to recover a fumble on the ensuing punt, they were flagged for catching interference.Alabama simply resumed its rush to judgment. McCarron continued to hand the ball to Lacy, who continued to plunge forward. The Crimson Tide mostly attacked the right side of Notre Dame’s defense, which looked like a matador, with Lacy playing the role of bull.“The toughness of our team came out in the beginning,” defensive back Hunter Bush said. “We attacked them exactly as we wanted to.”By the time Alabama scored its second touchdown, on a pass from McCarron to tight end Michael Williams, the Crimson Tide boasted a 123-8 advantage in total yardage. By the time Alabama scored its third touchdown, a T. J. Yeldon run on the first play of the second quarter, the Fighting Irish had 23 yards — and the Crimson Tide had 21 points.The most pertinent news in the rest of the first half came when Alabama actually punted. Alabama wound up with two 100-yard rushers: Lacy had 140 yards on 20 carries, and Yeldon had 108 on 21. McCarron, meanwhile, played as if intent on earning a statue of his own. He threw four touchdown passes and said afterward that he would return for his senior season and the chance to win a third straight national championship.“Our offense did an exceptional job,” Saban said, his face absent even a hint of emotion. While his players danced and hugged and shouted, Saban looked out at a mass of reporters and deadpanned, “I’m extremely happy.” They would have to take his word for it.As the game approached, the hype ballooned so as to dominate the national conversation about sports, until this felt less like a national championship game and more like a history lesson. Here they stood: Notre Dame and Alabama, golden helmets against red elephants, storied tradition opposite storied tradition, football in the heartland versus football in the South.If college football released an encyclopedia, these schools would occupy two of the larger volumes. Alabama claimed 14 national championships before Saturday; Notre Dame had 11. Alabama employed Bryant; Notre Dame had Knute Rockne, Ara Parseghian and Lou Holtz.“A couple of us were joking the other day that it’s ‘Rudy’ versus ‘Forrest Gump,’ ” said receiver Robby Toma, in reference to two movies made about these football programs.Before Saturday, the most-watched college football game took place between Texas and Southern California, in 2006, and it averaged 35.6 million viewers. This contest was expected to challenge and ultimately trump that number, at least until they played it.The assembled expected a game as old-school as its participants. Even in this era of spread offenses and fancy passing, Alabama and Notre Dame won with size more than speed. They won with linemen, with bulk, with two defenses ranked among the top five in the nation.“It’s not about the crazy receiving numbers or passing yards or rushing yards,” Notre Dame Coach Brian Kelly insisted. “This is about the big fellas, and this game will be decided unquestionably up front.”Kelly was right, of course, but not in the way he wanted to be. His team did score in the third quarter and end the shutout. It will eventually celebrate a season that brought the return of Notre Dame to college football’s elite.But not on Monday night. In this dud, Notre Dame flopped and Alabama triumphed and the SEC ruled again. The folks in Hollywood are unlikely to turn this season into any script, but Saban may get another statue anyway.Alabama will be among the favorites for next season. And the season after that. And for as long as Saban is the coach. The former Alabama and N.F.L. running back Shaun Alexander said on the field after the game: “You know what makes this more exciting? I think next year’s team will be better than this year’s team.”So how many championships can Saban win? “Who knows?” Johnson said. “How many years can he coach?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/football/nfl-football-roundup.html,"Mark Sanchez — or whoever quarterbacks the Jets next season — will be working with a different position coach next season. The Jets opted not to retain Matt Cavanaugh, whose departure is the first of what will probably be an overhaul of the coaching staff.As the embattled offensive coordinator Tony Sparano remained in limbo, Cavanaugh learned his fate on Monday, when coaches returned from a weeklong break.Cavanaugh was almost fired after last season, when the Jets interviewed potential replacements. He survived that, but not another poor season by Sanchez, who committed 26 turnovers and was benched twice. Sanchez’s 52 turnovers over the last two seasons are the most in the N.F.L.Cavanaugh’s dismissal allows the Jets to hire someone who can help reshape their passing game, a weakness under Sparano, whom the team is considering firing after he oversaw the league’s 30th-ranked offense.Cavanaugh, 56, was known among the Jets’ quarterbacks for his attention to detail and his dry, sarcastic sense of humor. Although he was fiercely protective of Sanchez, Cavanaugh, who rarely gave interviews, spoke more candidly about Sanchez’s shortcomings than Coach Rex Ryan and Sparano.Cavanaugh arrived in 2009, leaving the offensive coordinator’s post at his alma mater, Pitt, to join Ryan, who worked with him in Baltimore.The defensive coordinator Mike Pettine, another member of Ryan’s original staff, may also not return in 2013. He rejected a contract extension earlier in the season, and he is a candidate for the same job in Buffalo.REID TAKES OVER CHIEFS Andy Reid was introduced as the new coach of the Kansas City Chiefs on Monday, one week after he was fired following 14 mostly successful seasons in Philadelphia.Reid, 54, takes over for Romeo Crennel, who went 2-14 in his first full season as coach, the worst season in the Chiefs’ 53-year history. Crennel was fired last Monday, the same day Reid was dismissed after an Eagles tenure that included 130 wins, six division titles and an appearance in the Super Bowl.“Sometimes change is good,” said Reid, who coached the Eagles to a 4-12 record this season, dragging down his career record of 130-93-1.“It could be tremendous for the Philadelphia Eagles, and at the same time, I think it’s going to be tremendous for the Kansas City Chiefs,” Reid said. (AP)SYRACUSE COACH TO BUFFALO Doug Marrone is the Buffalo Bills’ new coach.Hired after going 25-25 in four seasons at Syracuse, Marrone, a 48-year-old from the Bronx, takes over a week after Chan Gailey was fired following three consecutive losing seasons.Marrone becomes the Bills’ fifth coach in 12 years. Buffalo’s 13-season playoff drought is the N.F.L.’s longest active streak, and the team has not had a winning record since 2004.  “I had said that the Syracuse job was my dream job, and I meant what I said,” Marrone said.“Today, I’m experiencing another dream come true,” he added. “I’ve chosen to be here. I can’t tell you how excited I am.”(AP)COLTS’ ARIANS OUT OF HOSPITAL The Colts’ offensive coordinator, Bruce Arians, returned to Indianapolis after being released from a Baltimore hospital following a 36-hour stay for an undisclosed illness.The team’s owner, Jim Irsay, told The Associated Press in a text message that Arians was accompanied by two team doctors, had been medicated and appeared to be on the mend.“He was in good spirits” and was trending in the “right direction,” Irsay wrote.Arians was admitted to the hospital Sunday morning after complaining he felt ill at the team breakfast before its 24-9 season-ending loss to the Ravens.(AP)EAGLES TO INTERVIEW A GRUDEN The Philadelphia Eagles received permission to interview the Cincinnati offensive coordinator Jay Gruden for their coaching vacancy.Gruden, the younger brother of the former Tampa Bay Buccaneers and Oakland Raiders coach Jon Gruden, just finished his second season with the Bengals.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/golf/steve-stricker-cuts-back-pga-tour-schedule.html,"KAPALUA, Hawaii — On his 27th hole of the day on Monday, Steve Stricker sat in the fairway and rolled on his back like a pill bug. Stricker had waited 67 hours 25 minutes to hit the first shot of his title defense at the Tournament of Champions, but a pinched nerve on his left side was causing him so much discomfort, he was not sure he could weather 36 holes on the hilly, 7,411-yard Plantation Course.When the event finally got under way Monday morning after a three-day wind delay, Stricker spoke to a rules official and expressed doubts that he would be able to finish. Upon picking himself up off the fairway at the 18th hole, his ninth of the second round, Stricker received the shot of adrenaline that he needed to continue. He holed his third shot for an eagle on his way to a six-under-par 67 and a 36-hole total of eight under, three strokes behind the leader, Dustin Johnson, who posted scores of 69 and 66.“My tempo is good because I can’t hit it very hard,” Stricker said. “It was uncomfortable to play, but it never got any worse.”Monday dawned here with gusts of 37 miles an hour, an unwelcome development given that the window was closing to complete the 54 holes required for an official event. Twice, the golfers had been sent out on the course, only to have their scores voided because heavy winds made the course unplayable.The winds died down Monday before the first groups went off at 7:10 a.m. and picked up in the afternoon, but the course remained playable because the greens were slower than normal.Tuesday’s 18-hole finish will not cause much of a disruption in Stricker’s schedule. Instead of continuing on to Honolulu for the next tour stop, an event he has graced almost every year since 1994, Stricker will travel only as far as the other side of Maui. He will spend the rest of the week snorkeling and sightseeing with his wife, Nicki, and their daughters Bobbi, 14, and Isabella, 6.The pinched nerve has been a nuisance for the past month, but it did not become a nagging pain until he arrived here. Asked if he would have made this stop one of his few starts if he had been in as much pain before the trip, Stricker said: “I’m sure we would have come. The kids would have dragged me over, for sure.”At 45, Stricker is the oldest player in the field, and he’s eighth on the career money list, with more than $35 million. Nine of his 12 tour victories have come since he turned 40, which is why his decision to slash his schedule almost in half this year after making 19 starts in 2012 raised some eyebrows.The decision to voluntarily step away makes Stricker an outlier in a culture that perpetuates the mantra “I compete, therefore I am.” Carl Pettersson, a self-described family man with two children and five tour victories, said: “I actually applaud him for doing it. It’s a big decision.”Unlike athletes in team sports, golfers are independent contractors. They are technically free to carve their own career paths.But it’s not that simple. As Stricker pointed out, he has corporate sponsors to serve, including Avis and Titleist. He said he consulted with each company to see if his reduced tour profile was going to be problematic, “and you know, for the most part,” he said, “they are all on board.”Andy North, a two-time United States Open champion, said the decision was consistent with Stricker’s character. “He’s a Midwest kind of guy who values the relationships with his family, his children and his community,” North said.North is not surprised that more athletes are unable to step back from their sports to enjoy the fruits of their labor and the company of their families. “You’ve dedicated your life, basically every waking moment of it, to try to do this, and so often guys don’t have anything else to do,” North said, adding: “For so many players, how they’re identified as a person is how they play. Steve is someone who looks at golf as what he does and not who he is.”North and Stricker share Wisconsin roots, and talk regularly. For a couple of years, Stricker has spoken of scaling back his schedule. That he decided to carry out his semiretirement plan this year led some people to wonder if Stricker was reacting to his struggles at the Ryder Cup, where he compiled an 0-4 record and missed a number of putts that are normally routine for him.Stricker insisted his decision had nothing to do with his Ryder performance and everything to do with a desire to be a more diligent husband and father. “My oldest has asked to come with me a number of times to practice, and it always seems like it’s not at the right time because I need to go and practice and try to get ready for a tournament and all that,” Stricker said.He continued: “You know, that’s what I want to change a little bit, is spend a little bit more time with her. She’s interested in the game, to get a little bit better, or whatever she wants, and maybe take some of the focus off what I’m doing and put it more on the other three.”Stricker, whose next event will be the match-play event outside Tucson in late February, also wants to devote time to a foundation for helping adolescents that he formed with one of his sponsors, American Family Insurance.“It’s time to spend a little bit more time at home, I think, do this foundation work, and just come out fresh and ready and prepare when I do play,” Stricker said. “And I still think I can play well and to a high level.” He added: “I’m extremely excited about it. It was kind of a weight lifted off when I made the decision.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/football/nfls-playoff-problem-lies-in-quality-not-quantity.html,"At some point this off-season, the N.F.L. will ruminate on an idea to expand its playoff field by two or four teams. The concept isn’t new — it was a pet project of the Kansas City Chiefs owner Lamar Hunt, who died in 2006 — and it wouldn’t be done in a vacuum. The extra layer of playoffs could come in exchange for a preseason reduced to two games, while the regular season would remain at 16. That makes expanded playoffs seem more appealing.Last weekend’s games do not.Even before Sunday’s finale — riveting in large part because we were watching Robert Griffin III embody what is so compelling yet so eyes-averting about football — wild-card weekend limped along with mistake-riddled, sporadically competitive play that raised the question: they really want more of that?Hunt argued that an expanded playoff field would keep more cities interested longer and would make it easier to sell tickets for the next season, because franchises could boast that they were playoff teams. It would also, of course, create another package of games for which television networks would have to pay.But the N.F.L., among the most reliable draws in entertainment the last few years, might risk turning off fans with an extra week of red zone inefficiency like that displayed by the Bengals and the Texans, who combined for six field goals and one offensive touchdown. After the Vikings had lost their starting quarterback, Christian Ponder, the biggest contribution they may have made to the N.F.L. on Saturday night was to underscore for general managers the importance of having a decent backup quarterback.The matchup of an outgoing legend, Ray Lewis, against an expected one, Andrew Luck, devolved into a game of who could overcome mistakes more efficiently. The Ravens’ Ray Rice lost two fumbles, the first ones he lost this season. Luck never got the Colts into a goal-to-go position.“It was great to make the playoffs, but we can’t make the mistakes we made to advance in the playoffs,” Luck said, summing up the plight of even the teams that did advance.From those missteps to the awkward one Griffin took before crumpling to the ground in the Redskins’ loss to the Seahawks, this was an unsightly quartet of games, exposing how fundamentally flawed most of the lowest-seeded playoff teams were this year and how further flawed the teams below them in the standings must have been. The Bengals might have looked as if they didn’t belong on the field Saturday when Andy Dalton finished with a quarterback rating of 44.7. But the team that would have been next to make the playoffs if the A.F.C. field had been expanded, the Steelers, lost to the Bengals at home with the playoffs on the line.“I think most people thought there was a separation in the quality of the teams,” said Charley Casserly, the former Houston and Washington executive. “Most people felt Minnesota and Cincinnati weren’t going to be around. And RGIII getting hurt certainly had an effect on that game.”The weekend’s games were so unmemorable that the biggest story lines Monday were the depressing state of Griffin’s knee and a ginned-up spat between Houston running back Arian Foster and the Boston Globe’s Dan Shaughnessy, who wrote a column mocking the Texans’ chances of beating the Patriots next weekend. No single play, no individual performance captured the imagination.Even if the Patriots repeat their regular-season blowout of the Texans, the divisional round can’t get here fast enough. It is typically the most entertaining of the playoffs because all of the top seeds are in action and, with them, the game’s best playmakers. Anticipation of another Peyton Manning-Tom Brady A.F.C. championship game is already building, and Aaron Rodgers figures to get a better test from a well-balanced San Francisco team than he did from the Vikings and their one-man show featuring Adrian Peterson.The Falcons are perhaps the least-respected top seed in playoff history, in large part because they have contributed to some playoff clunkers in recent years, like their 24-2 loss to the Giants in the first round last season. But they now get Seattle, one of the hottest teams left, and the Falcons’ foibles might make them more interesting. Coach Mike Smith said Monday they had learned from and been matured by their recent disappointments.“We feel very good about what we’ve accomplished thus far this year,” Smith said. “We have expectations. We set our goals and we’ve been clicking along pretty well this season. I like the way that we’ve played through the first season. The second season is getting ready to start, and I know that we respect everybody that’s in this tournament because they’ve fought very hard to get in it.”If only they’d played better once they got there."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/hockey/wearing-grins-and-team-logo-rangers-hit-the-ice.html,"GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Brian Boyle sat at his stall at the Rangers’ practice rink, beaming.“It’s different when you have a goal, when you have something to look forward to,” Boyle said after a 90-minute workout Monday, the team’s first since the N.H.L. and the players association reached a tentative agreement Sunday. “We’re ready to go.”The N.H.L. relaxed its lockout rules Monday, allowing players to go into team dressing rooms and talk to the news media. But no coaches or management officials were permitted to interact with players. The guidelines will be in place until a new collective bargaining agreement is ratified by the owners and the union membership, a process that may take several days.The board of governors’ vote initially planned for Tuesday in New York is now set for Wednesday. Union officials said that the process of reviewing the agreement would not be completed until at least Tuesday and that voting might begin Thursday. A league memo advised teams that training camps would not open until at least Saturday.All that points to the season starting Jan. 19 with a 48-game schedule, rather than Jan. 15 with a 50-game schedule.Still, in several N.H.L. cities, players skated as members of their teams for the first time in as many as nine months. Zach Parise and Ryan Suter skated in Minnesota Wild jerseys for the first time since signing huge free-agent contracts  in the off-season. Sidney Crosby skated with about a dozen Penguins teammates in suburban Pittsburgh. Alex Ovechkin returned to Washington from the Kontinental Hockey League, thanking his Dynamo Moscow teammates and wishing them luck via Twitter.In Greenburgh, N.Y., 15 Rangers wore the team’s practice sweaters as Ryan Callahan and Brad Richards devised drills. Rick Nash, the 30-goal scorer acquired from Columbus last summer, was with them. It felt normal, except for the absence of Coach John Tortorella, who was elsewhere in the building.“Coming in here today and feeling the energy is something that kind of motivates you,” Mike Rupp said. “It felt kind of good to kick it up a notch. You can have fun when you’re scrimmaging, but now, when you’re really feeling the puck on your stick, crisp and hard, snapping it around out there, it feels good.”Richards said the Rangers were so happy to be there that some arrived two hours early.“We were kind of staring at each other; we didn’t know what to do,” he said. “By Wednesday we should have everybody here.”Afterward, the players talked about the excitement they felt at the prospect of a new season, the challenge of playing a 48-game schedule and, as much as anything, how proud they were of the union’s solidarity.“No other professional sports union has sat out more games than us,” Marc Staal said, referring to three lockouts in less than 20 years. “We felt we were getting taken advantage of in the beginning, and we stayed strong through the whole thing.”Boyle said: “We were dying to play — those were dark days. It was awful the way it happened. We’re not insensitive to that. Now it’s a huge relief; we’re ready to play. Hopefully, we can ease some of the pain from what was lost.”Throughout the day, players and owners around the league apologized to fans for putting them through another lockout.“I can totally understand if fans don’t come back,” Richards said. “But for those who do, we can’t wait to play our hearts out, get back out there and make the game the way it’s supposed to be.”Anton Stralman was one of the dozen or so players who stayed in the New York area during the lockout and rented the Rangers’ practice rink — permissible under lockout rules, as long as they stayed out of the dressing room. He was not sure if he would be more prepared for the season than those who played in Europe or the American Hockey League.“It’s two-sided,” Stralman said. “They’ve been playing for a little while now and feel a little more comfortable. At the same time they might be a little more tired too, or have injuries.”Nash, who spent the lockout in the Swiss National League A, said he thought playing competitively “makes you ready.” But he added that he “lost that edge” because he was sidelined recently by minor injuries.Tortorella said the lockout was uncomfortable because “as a coach, I’m not with management, I’m not with the players.”Intense as always, he talked about how eager he was to get started, even if it may be a few more days before he can really get started.“This is the only thing I know how to do,” Tortorella said. “The players wanting to be together, the coaches want to be with them, too. We want to get back with them. We feel like we’re a tight-knit group and, quite honestly, I miss them.”He had a message for Rangers fans, who are keen to follow up last season’s first-place finish and trip to the conference finals.“I can tell them our team will be ready, and we’re going to try to start right where we left off last year,” he said."

Aston Villa lost by 1-0 at home against Southampton.LYON IN FIRST PLACE Lyon took advantage of Paris St.-Germain’s unexpected slip up by winning at Troyes, 2-1, to move into first place in the French league.Both of Lyon’s goals came from corners as Maxime Gonalons and Samuel Umtiti scored.P.S.G. labored to a 1-1 tie against Ajaccio on Friday.The win moved Lyon 2 points ahead of P.S.G. and three ahead of Marseille, which can overtake P.S.G. and tie Lyon on points if it wins at Sochaux on Sunday.HERMANN TROPHY WINNERS Maryland forward Patrick Mullins and North Carolina’s Crystal Dunn, who is from Rockville Centre, N.Y., have won the Hermann Trophy as the top college players in the United States.Mullins and Dunn, both juniors, won in voting announced Friday night by the Missouri Athletic Club.Notre Dame forward Ryan Finley was second in the men’s voting, and Creighton midfielder Jose Gomez was third. Penn State midfielder Christine Nairn was the women’s runner-up, followed by Virginia midfielder Caroline Miller.Mullins scored 17 goals and had 10 assists for the Terrapins, who lost to Georgetown on penalty kicks in the semifinals of the N.C.A.A. Division I tournament. He became the second Maryland player to win the award after Jason Garey in 2005.Dunn, a member of the winning United States team at last year’s FIFA Under-20 World Cup, began the season as a central defender before the move to midfield. She helped North Carolina win its 21st national championship, assisting on goals in both the semifinal and final.PERALTA FUELS SANTOS The Olympic gold-medal-winning striker Oribe Peralta scored twice Friday to give Santos Laguna a 2-0 home win over Chivas Guadalajara in Torreon in the Mexican Clausura.Peralta, who scored both goals when Mexico beat Brazil, 2-1, in the Olympic final at Wembley Stadium in London in August, put Santos ahead in the 36th minute and increased its lead on a goal by the Spaniard Marc Crosas’s cross in the 73rd minute of the game at Estadio Corona.Chivas, now playing under the former Santos coach Benjamin Galindo, could have pulled one back in the fourth minute of added time but goalkeeper Oswaldo Sánchez, who has played 99 times for Mexico’s national team, saved Luis Pérez’s weak penalty kick.“We had several chances, maybe more than them, but we didn’t finish, and we’ve got to admit Oswaldo had a good night,” Chivas forward Marco Fabian told Guadalajara’s Web site."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/football/12-year-old-is-a-radio-commentator-and-an-nfl-trend.html,"BALTIMORE — As the Ravens were losing three consecutive games in December, Cullen Little told his radio audience that the team should let quarterback Joe Flacco leave as a free agent.The remark surprised some listeners. Flacco, after all, has twice reached the A.F.C. Championship game and been to the playoffs in each of his five seasons. A listener called in to say that rather than the Ravens’ dumping Flacco, the station should cut Cullen.If that happened, Cullen would move on with his life as a sixth grader and a nationally ranked squash player.But at 12, he has found an audience as a football savant while sharing an hourlong broadcast, “The Booker Corrigan Show,” on Thursday nights on a local CBS Sports Radio station.The show has 25,000 listeners and another 20,000 who download its podcasts, Corrigan said. Although he does not have ratings figures to demonstrate any Cullen Little effect, “I’d certainly bet that we’ve increased” the audience.Cullen, a 4-foot-9, 73-pound boy, called in to the show in early November and within weeks was sitting beside the host.“One of the things I saw in Cullen was a great ability to communicate at a much higher level than a 12-year-old,” Corrigan said.Those first tuning in might be jarred by Cullen’s knowledge of intricate defenses and of backup tight ends playing for far-off teams.“I’m on the air because people want to hear my opinions,” he said last week after ducking out of class at the Calvert School. “I’m not just going to say what people want to hear.”“I’m a Ravens fan. I’d love it if they won, don’t get me wrong, but I don’t see that happening,” he added, revealing his prediction for Saturday’s Baltimore-Denver A.F.C. playoff game.In the studio, he offered a play-calling tip, too — with an edge. Little cited the Giants’ and the Oakland Raiders’ use of flare patterns to their running backs when they visited Baltimore this season.“I’d like to see that once,” he said of the Ravens, shaking his head. “That’s my wish for this game: to see one flare route to Ray Rice because he can use his speed to get outside and pass those linebackers. They won’t be expecting it because all we ever do is throw screens.”Cullen’s knowledge of the game has gone hand in hand with his passion for fantasy football. In 2010, he joined a league his father, Stephen, a real estate lawyer, formed for neighborhood youngsters.Now Cullen is a member of five leagues, including one that consists of 20 sixth graders at his school. Cullen has traded some of his talented players to help his friends.Cullen’s ability to master numbers and concepts while applying them critically serves him well in fantasy football and on the radio, his math teacher, Roman Doss, said.Cullen’s precociousness drew the interest of Brian Rolapp, the chief operating officer of NFL Media, the business arm of the N.F.L., whose holdings include fantasy football leagues. Fifty-four percent of fantasy players on nfl.com are 13 to 29, he said.Those players would also appear to be a key to the N.F.L. in developing fans. The 13-to-29 group, Rolapp said, reads four times more pages on the league’s Web site, returns twice as often and stays on the site six times longer than the average visitor.“It’s not just college guys,” Rolapp said. “It’s young people like Cullen, it’s women. It’s become more adopted by the N.F.L. fan base. They do everything; they go on RedZone, and they watch games they wouldn’t ordinarily be interested in.”Cullen spends Sundays glued to the N.F.L. RedZone channel, watching every scoring opportunity across the league, between glances at his laptop to check on his fantasy players. (His 9 p.m. bedtime means he misses most of the Sunday and Monday night games.)Cullen absorbs all that information, which becomes the basis for his Thursday commentary. His comments on the radio, however, can be puzzling.On Thursday, Corrigan and a guest picked New England to defeat Houston in another A.F.C. playoff matchup.“How about you, Cullen?” Corrigan said.“I think Houston will win this one,” Cullen said.“They’ve got J. J. Watt on the line,” he said. “They’re going to put lots of pressure on Tom Brady, and he doesn’t always react well to pressure,” he added, although Brady drove the Patriots downfield in the closing minutes to win three Super Bowls, starting when Cullen was a toddler.“Under pressure, when he can’t step up into the pocket and be comfortable where he’s used to being, he’s just going to crack, in my opinion — and when he does, and they don’t score 30 points, the Texans are going to come out offensively, throw the ball to Andre Johnson and Owen Daniels, and hand the ball to Arian Foster. I think the Houston Texans are going to win this game, 23-17.”As for the Ravens, he said: “I don’t see it happening. I call the Broncos, 27-23.”With that, Cullen joined his mother, Emily, and skipped out of the studio. He was wearing shorts because squash practice came next."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/football/ravens-beat-broncos-in-double-overtime.html,"DENVER — In Peyton Manning’s 15-year career, there has been a lone dent in his legacy. For all of his regular-season brilliance, Manning has, in all but one season, been unable to propel his team to the championship. Manning’s teams have gone to the postseason 12 times, but in 7 of the previous 11 trips, Manning’s team has lost in its first playoff game.On Saturday, with a new team and what he said felt like a different body, Manning met that fate again, this time in a stunning double-overtime 38-35 loss that sent the Baltimore Ravens to the A.F.C. Championship game for the second year in a row and the third time in five years. They will go on the road again next Sunday to play the winner of the Patriots-Texans game.“That football game did the game of football proud,” Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said.The Broncos may struggle to agree, but the game was a thriller of big plays and wild swings from the opening moments, with three touchdowns scored in little more than the first five minutes. But the pivotal turn of fortune came near the end of the first overtime.Manning rolled to his right to avoid pressure, then tried to throw across his body to the left. Much has been made of his arm strength since he had four neck operations in 2010 and 2011, but this mistake was as much mental as it was physical. The pass wobbled, and the Ravens’ Corey Graham stepped in front of its intended target, Brandon Stokley. It was Graham’s second interception of the day — he returned the first for a touchdown — and this one set up the winning 47-yard field goal by Justin Tucker, the Ravens’ rookie kicker.“I wouldn’t say I’m shocked,” said Manning, who completed 28 of 43 passes for 290 yards, 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions. “That’s not the right word. I’m disappointed.”The Ravens, who have overcome a late-season swoon in which they lost four of their last five regular-season games, stormed the field, and the Broncos, the top seed in the A.F.C., trudged into their tunnel. Manning will take the brunt of the blame for the loss because of that interception, and almost immediately after the game, it was widely noted that Tim Tebow had won one playoff game for the Broncos last year before he was dumped in favor of Manning. Peter Tebow, Tim’s brother, even joined in.“Am I the only one in Denver who’s happy right now?” he wrote on his Twitter feed soon after the game.But when the Broncos review this game, they may wonder why one of the top-ranked defenses in the league could not hold a lead with 41 seconds to play, and why the coaches grew so conservative they did not seem to trust Manning to throw to get a final first down in regulation that would have closed out the game.That decision allowed the Ravens to have the ball one final time in regulation, and the Broncos’ secondary, vulnerable to the deep pass all day, allowed Jacoby Jones to get behind it. He ran down the right sideline and Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco, shifting in the pocket to avoid pressure on third down, launched a 70-yard pass for a touchdown that tied the score.Manning’s résumé is lengthy, including his 9-11 record in the postseason. But Flacco’s is still forming, and he is often underappreciated because of the Ravens’ long-standing reputation for winning with defense. But this season, as the defense faltered, the Ravens relied more on Flacco. He finished the game completing 18 of 34 passes for 331 yards, 3 touchdowns and no interceptions, and that throw to Jones will now be the one for which he is known. Until, of course, he wins a Super Bowl title of his own, perhaps in a few weeks.“He grew up today,” the retiring linebacker Ray Lewis said of Flacco.In the locker room after the game, Broncos safety Rahim Moore, who was playing deep on the Jones catch and saw the ball float inches over his outstretched right hand, was near tears.“It’s my fault,” he said.Some of the blame will surely go to the coaches, too, who had Manning take a knee with 30 seconds left in regulation and two timeouts remaining, instead of trying to get into field-goal position.A Patriots victory over the Texans in their divisional game would result in a rematch of last year’s A.F.C. Championship game, which the Patriots won when the Ravens dropped a pass in the end zone that would have won the game and then missed a field goal with 11 seconds left that would have sent the game to overtime.As suspenseful as that game was, it was nothing compared with Saturday’s. It included two special-teams returns for touchdowns by the Broncos’ Trindon Holliday, including a 90-yarder on a punt return after the opening drive of the game and a 104-yarder on the opening kickoff of the second half.The Ravens overcame those and three Manning touchdown passes with a plan to attack the Broncos deep, particularly targeting cornerback Champ Bailey by exploiting the speed of receiver Torrey Smith. The Ravens scored their first two offensive touchdowns on passes of 59 yards and 32 yards to Smith.The second touchdown was set up when Broncos Coach John Fox chose to try a 52-yard field goal with 1 minute 21 seconds left in the first half. Matt Prater’s foot dragged in the dirt near the hash mark, and the ball fell well short, giving Flacco and Smith a short field to work with. They hardly needed the help.The Ravens were beaten soundly by the Broncos in Week 15 of the regular season, when Bailey contained Smith with little trouble. But Saturday’s catches by Smith served notice that the Ravens, perhaps bolstered by the return to health of several of their defensive players, including Lewis, would keep pace with the Broncos’ high-scoring offense.It seemed fitting that in a season in which the Ravens’ focus unmistakably shifted to offense, including the decision to fire the offensive coordinator Cam Cameron late in the season, it was Flacco who outdueled the legend on the other sideline. The Ravens moved on, hoping to reach the Super Bowl for the first time since they won it after the 2000 season on the back of their defense. And Manning went home again, still seeking his second championship, in a new place but with the same result."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/football/brady-and-belichick-in-13th-season-of-few-words-and-many-wins.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Bill Belichick is excited. Really, he is. Or rather, he says he is. The sentiment must be qualified because anyone observing Belichick’s news conference Friday — attended by a few dozen reporters and filmed by a row of cameras — can attest that he expressed it with all the emotion of a rutabaga.Every word sounds alike when it leaves his mouth, a mouth whose lips, rumor has it, have yet to form a smile. The perception of Belichick, so skillfully fashioned, is that he wakes up every day as if sentenced to the middle seat on a trans-Atlantic flight.“I get a big kick out of him,” the Patriots’ owner, Robert K. Kraft, said last week in an interview in his Gillette Stadium office. “Think about it: Why did I hire him? Why did I give up a No. 1 draft pick for him? I really like the guy. When he’s answering those questions, he’s doing it in a way that’s in the best interest of our football team.”The best interest of Kraft’s team is winning, which the Patriots have done better than anyone else since Belichick arrived in 2000, three months before they spent the 199th pick in the draft on a quarterback from Michigan named Tom Brady. With a victory in Sunday’s divisional-round game here against Houston, Brady would surpass his boyhood idol, Joe Montana, for the most postseason wins. He does not seem impressed.“Football is a team game,” Brady said. “I’ve been fortunate to play here and have the opportunity.”Belichick and Brady are the immovable objects of the N.F.L. playoffs, together capturing 3 Super Bowl titles, 5 conference championships and 10 division titles. They have become perhaps the most famous coach and quarterback of their generation while saying little over these last 13 seasons, a remarkable accomplishment in this me-first era of overexposure.New England went 12-4 this season, winning 9 of its last 10 games while leading the N.F.L. in scoring and total offense, and yet the story lines churned out by the playoff machine centered on Ray Lewis’s final dance, Peyton Manning’s comeback, young quarterbacks galore. The Patriots are afterthoughts, their success assumed, expected.“We let our actions speak louder than our words here,” Kraft said.Belichick and Brady stifle their charismatic personalities, curb their enthusiasm, revel in being purposefully bland and opaque. The team’s injury report is all but a farce. Insight is dispensed in minimal doses, like Tylenol to an infant, but overwhelmed by bromides, wrapped in a mystery inside a hoodie cloaked by a puffy Patriots jacket.A typical exchange occurred Wednesday, when Belichick was asked to describe the running style of Arian Foster, the Texans’ star running back.“Good,” he said.And that was all. No elaboration, no embellishment, at least not until, in an act of mercy, Belichick acknowledged that Foster is also “fast,” has “good vision” and — wait for it — “breaks tackles.”What about Foster’s patience? Belichick was asked.“Good,” he said. “He finds the holes.”Indeed. Then again, so do spelunkers. Or rabbits. For his 15-minute news conference Wednesday, Brady wore a gray sweatshirt that read, “Property of New England.” Which he is in toto, submitting to all that comes with it.Questions about his performance are met with answers about the team’s. Rob Gronkowski and Aaron Hernandez pose a matchup problem for opponents, but Brady declined to praise his tight ends, saying “execution” was what counted most.If Belichick is dour and gruff, Brady is mellow, neither brusque nor dismissive. He did, for instance, respond to a question about the demands of football on his family — specifically, spending time with his newborn daughter — without objection.“There’s not much I can do to help at this point,” he said. “Mom is doing a lot of that.”Occasionally he grins, in a genuine if calculated way, offering a glimpse into his humanity. But then he is gone, having ducked behind a curtain, not to be seen again for another four days, until Sunday afternoon. The only evidence of Brady’s presence could be gleaned from linebacker Jerod Mayo’s choice of footwear on Wednesday — a pair of dark Uggs, the sheepskin boots endorsed by Brady.“They don’t care if people know who they actually are and what their personalities are like,” said the former New England offensive lineman Damien Woody, who played four years for Belichick and with Brady and is now an analyst for ESPN. “All they care about is winning games, and they just leave it at that.”Around the Patriots, tomorrow does not exist until midnight. It is always about the next practice, the next meeting, the next film study, the next session in the weight room. Nothing matters more than that moment, a philosophy instilled by Belichick, enforced by Brady.“I’ve been in other situations where you start talking about the playoffs, and it’s the middle of the season, or you start talking about the Super Bowl toward the end of the season,” receiver Donte Stallworth said. “But not here. Bill doesn’t allow that.” And has not allowed it since that first season, 2000, when New England went 5-11 and the reaction to Belichick was fierce. Kraft believed in Belichick — “it’s more important to give people support in difficult times than in good times,” he said — and Brady ascended, a Super Bowl followed, and now, once again, it is playoff time, the Patriots one of the teams left.Another year of Belichick and Brady, another year of everyone talking about Belichick and Brady — except for Belichick and Brady.“There’s no place I’d rather be,” Brady said.The Patriots Way rolls onward."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/football/foster-speaks-like-a-shaman-and-runs-like-an-all-pro.html,"HOUSTON — The question made Arian Foster think, which to him is precisely the point. “Understand the universe, you’ll understand me,” reads part of the profile on his Twitter account, so when Foster was asked whether he loves winning or hates losing, he answered like a shaman in search of spiritual balance.“So they would rather not win than to lose?” Foster said. “It’s the same emotion. You’re winning. I feel you, though. I’m with you, bro.”Foster continued with a golf analogy, neatly breaking down what drives people competing individually in that sport or as a team in football. A philosophy major in college, Foster can range from entertaining to esoteric in his interview sessions, and last week was no exception as he was quizzed on the mood and motivations of the Houston Texans.Indeed, his aura again will be closely scrutinized Sunday, acting as a gauge of sorts as to whether the Texans have figured out a way to win their A.F.C. divisional round rematch with the New England Patriots, who crushed Houston, 42-14, in December.Foster’s impact was minimized in that game after the Patriots broke to a 28-0 lead early in the third quarter. He finished with 46 yards rushing, his fourth-lowest total this season, and caught four passes for 39 yards.But Foster is the synapse to Houston’s offensive psyche, and unless he is breaking free off tackle and slicing into the secondary on a consistent basis, the Texans cannot control the clock and keep New England quarterback Tom Brady on the bench.“We play well and play our style of football early, I think we can keep their offense off of the field,” Foster said. “They’re a rhythm offense, so if we can help them throw them off rhythm, that might sway the game in our favor.”The Texans provided a blueprint in their 19-13 victory over the Cincinnati Bengals in last week’s wild-card game. Foster rushed for 140 yards and Houston held the ball 17 minutes 38 seconds longer than Cincinnati — a difference of more than a full quarter.“I’ve been around some good ones, and this guy, the bigger the game, it just seems like the bigger Arian gets,” Texans Coach Gary Kubiak said after the victory. “The whole stadium knew we had to line up and run the ball, and boy, was he at this best there at the end.”Foster, known for being vocal in the huddle, addressed his linemen at several key junctures against the Bengals.“He’s not shy about letting you know that he’s ready to put the game on his back,” tackle Duane Brown said. “He said, ‘Look, the game’s on us, let’s get this done, let’s not let the defense go back on the field.’ ”Foster has now rushed for more than 100 yards in his first three playoff games, the only player in N.F.L. history to do so, and has totaled 425 yards in the postseason, with an average of 5.12 yards per carry. He scored Houston’s only touchdown against the Bengals on a 1-yard run, but the Texans remained suspended in a paradox that has cost them numerous points in their last four games.They have Foster, who this season led the N.F.L. with 17 touchdowns and was the A.F.C.’s second-leading rusher with 1,424 yards, only 85 yards behind Kansas City’s Jamaal Charles. Yet the Texans have trouble finding the end zone, scoring only three touchdowns in their last 13 trips inside the red zone, a trend that started after their blowout loss at New England.“When we went down there five weeks ago, we were 100 percent in the red zone,” Kubiak joked last week. “We were two for two. It sure as heck didn’t help. I’m just worried about finding a way to play a good football game.”Kubiak laughed when reminded about the stroke of good fortune in his releasing but then rediscovering Foster, who was an undrafted free agent from Tennessee in 2009. Foster, re-signed later that season, made his first start against the Patriots, gaining 119 yards on 20 carries, scoring 2 touchdowns and quickly forging an All-Pro career.“The thing that helps players really take their game to the next level in my opinion is when they don’t have to work so darn hard on game plans because they know things,” Kubiak said. “He’s very smart. You could walk in with 40 new runs and 100 new passes. It’d take Arian about an hour to sit there in a meeting and study it and he could go right out. It’s no problem. His talents take over all the time because he is such a smart player.”Foster prides himself on having a philosophical nature and escaping football with hobbies like reading. “He’s a big believer in energy and vibes,” said Brown, to whom Foster has recommended several books. “He’s just a different cat, man, but in a good way. He does have an aura or something about him, especially on game days.”Asked about a book he recently referred to in an interview session, Foster reached into his locker stall for his smartphone and showed a picture of the jacket cover of “The Shaman & Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms.” It is about an elixir found in remote areas of Peru that is brewed of vines and leaves and is considered sacred.“Some people believe it gets you in touch with, like a sense of spirituality, that you’ll understand the oneness of all things,” Foster said. “I’m about halfway through it.”“Does it last long?” Foster was asked.“I’ve never done it,” he said with a laugh.“It’s just a good book,” he continued.“There’s so much time spent here; when you go home, some people play video games, some people watch TV, some watch movies. Sometimes I read, to get your mind off things.”And think."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/football/broncos-returner-trindon-holliday-raises-his-stature.html,"DENVER — At 5 feet 5 inches, Trindon Holliday of the Denver Broncos is the N.F.L.’s shortest player and its biggest good-luck charm.Holliday returned a punt and a kickoff for touchdowns in Denver’s 38-35 loss to the Baltimore Ravens in an A.F.C. divisional game Saturday, the first player in N.F.L. history to pull off such a double in a playoff game. But there was an equally intriguing part of Holliday’s performance.He played 17 games this season, 5 for Houston and 12 for the Broncos. Until Saturday, his teams were 16-0. Holliday’s only losing game ended his season.The Texans waived Holliday, a third-year player, after opening the season with five consecutive victories. The next week, Houston lost to Green Bay, 42-24; the Texans went on to finish 12-4 and win the A.F.C. South title. Denver claimed Holliday on Oct. 11 and four days later began an 11-game winning streak that lasted through the end of the regular season.The Broncos had been looking for a dynamic return man after losing the unrestricted free agent Eddie Royal to San Diego in the off-season. Holliday has been exactly that. As a Bronco, Holliday, who is listed at 170 pounds, averaged 32.5 yards on kickoff returns and 10.8 yards on punt returns.In his third game with Denver, he ran a kickoff back 105 yards for a touchdown at Cincinnati — the longest play in Broncos history — and the next week returned a punt 76 yards for a score at Carolina. Counting his production in Houston, Holliday averaged 10 yards on punt returns and 26.3 on kickoff returns.So who is Holliday, and how was someone this fleet available?Born in Zachary, La., Holliday first drew the attention of N.F.L. scouts as a football and track standout at Louisiana State. Besides returning two kicks and two punts for touchdowns as a collegian, Holliday won the 100-meter title at the 2009 N.C.A.A. outdoor championships in 10.0 seconds after finishing second in 2007 and third in 2008. He also took second to the American record-holder Tyson Gay at the 2007 United States outdoor championships.A 4.29-second clocking in the 40-yard dash at the 2010 N.F.L. combine helped Holliday land in Houston as a sixth-round pick. A broken thumb cost Holliday his entire rookie season. He spent most of 2011 on Houston’s practice squad, playing in one game, returning one punt for no yards and making three fair catches.Last summer, an electrifying preseason in which Holliday returned one kickoff and two punts for touchdowns earned him a spot on Houston’s opening day roster. Through five games, Holliday averaged 9.2 yards on punt returns, but his lackluster 19.4-yard mark on kickoffs left him expendable when the Texans needed defensive help. Indianapolis, then 2-2, and 2-3 Denver each claimed Holliday, who was awarded to the Broncos because Denver had the poorer record. He became the shortest player to ever suit up for the Broncos.On Saturday, Holliday’s contributions could not have been bigger. Less than three minutes into the game, Holliday retreated to field a Sam Koch punt at the Broncos’ 10 and took it 90 yards for a touchdown. Holliday ran forward, eluded an attempted tackle by Brendon Ayanbadejo, then headed toward the right sideline, where Lance Ball blocked Koch, the last Raven with a shot at him. It was the longest punt return for a touchdown in N.F.L. postseason history.Because Denver had won the coin toss and deferred, Holliday began the second half back deep for Justin Tucker’s kickoff. Moments later, Holliday also owned the N.F.L. postseason record for the longest kickoff return for a touchdown — 104 yards. By himself, Holliday had matched the touchdown production of the Peyton Manning-led Denver offense for a 28-21 lead.The chances of Baltimore letting Holliday return anything significant the rest of the day? Zero. With 31 seconds left in regulation, Holliday leapt and waved his arms, trying to fire up the crowd after the Ravens tied the game, 35-35, on Joe Flacco’s 70-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones. But Tucker, with the wind behind him, drilled the ball far past the back line of the end zone for a touchback."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/football/colin-kaepernick-and-49ers-dominate-the-packers.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — There were 22 players on the field, dozens more on the sideline, 69,732 fans at Candlestick Park and millions watching from home.For much of Saturday night’s playoff game between the San Francisco 49ers and the Green Bay Packers, it seemed as if they all revolved around a single, budding, shining star: Colin Kaepernick.Kaepernick, justifying November’s decision by San Francisco Coach Jim Harbaugh to hand the team’s championship aspirations to an untested, strong-armed second-year quarterback, dominated the field with long scrambles and pinpoint throws. He kept the Packers’ defense as off-balance as a slowing top, set records and outplayed the reigning N.F.L. most valuable player, Aaron Rodgers.And on a cool, clear evening that may stand as the coming-out party for San Francisco’s next great quarterback, he led the 49ers to a 45-31 victory and a spot in the N.F.C. championship game.“Just a guy playing football,” 49ers wide receiver Michael Crabtree said of Kaepernick. “Man, he’s making it happen — with his feet, his arm, making plays. He’s a playmaker.”The 49ers will either play the Falcons in Atlanta or face the division-rival Seattle Seahawks at Candlestick Park next Sunday, for a spot in the Super Bowl.There will be two Harbaughs coaching for a Super Bowl berth. John Harbaugh, Jim’s older brother, is head coach of the Baltimore Ravens, who beat the Denver Broncos in overtime earlier on Saturday. The Ravens will play in the A.F.C. championship game against either New England or Houston.Saturday’s games overlapped; Jim Harbaugh received word of his brother’s success through the coaching headset in the first quarter.By then, it was clear that San Francisco’s chances were in the hands of Kaepernick. He completed 17 of 31 passes for 263 yards, with two touchdowns to Crabtree in the second quarter and an early interception that was returned for a touchdown to open the game’s scoring.But Kaepernick was at his most damaging when he ran. He not only outgained running back Frank Gore, who had 119 rushing yards, but Kaepernick’s 181 rushing yards, on 16 carries, were the most for an N.F.L. quarterback in any game, regular season or postseason.His 56-yard touchdown run midway through the third quarter broke a 24-24 tie and the Packers’ spirit. The 49ers scored touchdowns on the next two possessions. The 21-point surge came on steamrolling drives of 80, 93 and 93 yards.Kaepernick became the third quarterback with two rushing and two passing touchdowns in a playoff game, joining Otto Graham (1954 and 1955) and Jay Cutler (2011).Now Kaepernick, after only seven regular-season starts and armed with the element of surprise, stands one victory from joining Joe Montana and Steve Young as the only quarterbacks to lead the 49ers to the Super Bowl.San Francisco’s 579 total yards broke the franchise postseason record set in Super Bowl XIX, when the Montana-led 49ers beat Miami.After the game, as he heaped praise on his teammates, Kaepernick was asked if he should be categorized as a passer or a runner. “I don’t like to be categorized,” he said.The 49ers reached last year’s N.F.C. championship game behind the cool efficiency of the veteran quarterback Alex Smith. Midway through this season, it appeared they were headed deep into the postseason again with the same mistake-free mantra: Make Smith as invisible as possible. At his best, he would control the game, manage it, but not dominate it.But Harbaugh worried that Smith, as solid and dependable as he had become under his tutelage, was the weakest link on a roster bulging with win-now talent. When Smith sustained a concussion in November, Kaepernick stepped in and dazzled in his first start.It was enough of a test run for Harbaugh. He kept Kaepernick in the starting role, despite Smith’s 6-2 record and position as the league’s top-rated passer. Debate raged in San Francisco over whether the coach had abandoned a surer and steadier approach to the Super Bowl for a much riskier one.As if to build drama, Kaepernick’s second pass Saturday was intercepted and returned 52 yards for a touchdown by cornerback Sam Shields, giving Green Bay a 7-0 lead.But Kaepernick quickly led an 80-yard drive, ending with a 20-yard scramble for a touchdown.Kaepernick’s teammates were struck by his sense of calm on the sideline after the early interception. Harbaugh noted that Kaepernick has led the 49ers on a scoring drive immediately after each of his turnovers this season. “That’s a rare quality,” Harbaugh said. “So far he’s shown that he’s got that ability to come back.”The game quickly morphed into a can-you-top-this duel between the two quarterbacks, an unexpected intersection of two men raised in California.Kaepernick was born in Wisconsin and moved to California’s Central Valley when he was 4. But he remained a Packers fan, wearing No. 4 in high school in honor of Brett Favre.Rodgers played collegiately across San Francisco Bay at Cal and grew up in Chico, a three-hour drive north of the Bay Area, dreaming of becoming the next Montana or Young.But when the 49ers held the first overall choice of the 2005 draft, they picked Smith over Rodgers. Rodgers fell down the draft until he landed with Green Bay on the 24th pick.The San Francisco snub has driven him since, but it has long ceased to define him, especially since winning the Super Bowl two seasons ago and becoming the league’s most valuable player in 2011.It was that matchup — the experienced Rodgers against the young Kaepernick, a player who had lost to Smith in the 2005 draft order against one who had taken Smith’s job in November — that seemed to give Green Bay the advantage in these playoffs.But Rodgers spent much of the night on the sideline, watching Kaepernick captivate fans and put points on the scoreboard. The 49ers controlled the ball for 38 of the game’s 60 minutes. Rodgers, building his statistics mostly in a vain attempt for a late comeback, completed 26 of 39 passes for 257 yards and 2 touchdowns with an interception.“He was running all over the field,” Rodgers said. “He’s big, strong, athletic, throws the ball well and runs the ball extremely well. We didn’t really have a whole lot of answers for him.”Kaepernick’s ability to enthrall was highlighted on one second-quarter possession. On a third-and-nine at Green Bay’s 24-yard line, Kaepernick scrambled up the middle, collecting 15 yards before being sandwiched by two Packers. Kaepernick stood quickly and defiantly spun the ball toward the fallen defenders, eliciting an unsportsmanlike-conduct penalty for taunting.Two plays later, Kaepernick threw a pass so hard that it barely had any arc at all, landing in Crabtree’s hands in the end zone.Rodgers duplicated the scoring play moments later, firing for a touchdown on a similarly slanting pass pattern to James Jones for a 20-yard touchdown.But by the third quarter, Rodgers was stuck in a game of catch-up. And with Kaepernick in control, he never had a chance."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sports/football/broncos-see-victory-slip-away-after-conservative-calls.html,"DENVER — The Denver Broncos had this one. With a 7-point lead late in the game, possession of the ball and Peyton Manning running the offense, Broncos fans had every reason to believe their team would still be playing next weekend.But given a chance to put away Baltimore with two minutes left in Saturday’s A.F.C. divisional playoff game, Denver Coach John Fox opted to run the clock and run the ball on third-and-7 rather than trying to throw for a first down. The Ravens stuffed Ronnie Hillman for no gain, Denver punted and, with 31 seconds left, Joe Flacco found Jacoby Jones for a 70-yard touchdown.“We were running the clock,” Fox said. “Pretty standard. As it worked out, it wasn’t great.”After a touchback, Manning — who had led 48 winning drives in the fourth quarter and overtime, an N.F.L. record — trotted back onto the field with two timeouts left and enough time to move the Broncos into field-goal range. Again, Fox took a conservative approach. As the announced crowd of 76,732 at Sports Authority Field booed, Manning took a knee, leaving the Broncos to take their chances in overtime.“If you don’t win, you get criticized on everything, so that is par for the course,” Fox said when asked about the decision. “The thinking was, with 30 seconds left it’s hard to go the length of the field, and some bad stuff can happen, as you saw at the end of the game.”Manning put the Broncos ahead, 35-28, with a 17-yard touchdown pass to Demaryius Thomas with 7 minutes 11 seconds to play. Baltimore drove to the Denver 31 before Flacco threw an incompletion on fourth down, giving Denver and Manning the ball back with 3:12 left.Hillman ran four times for 16 yards, picking up a first down, forcing Baltimore Coach John Harbaugh to use his final two timeouts, and running the clock down to the two-minute warning.With the ball at his 47, Fox weighed the risk of a clock-stopping incompletion against a run. Fox chose to give it to Hillman one more time.“The entire offense wanted to end the game right there,” Manning said, refusing to second-guess Fox. “We certainly never want to give their offense a chance. We got one first down. We needed to get another. We got the one first down, made them use their timeouts; that certainly factored into the decision.”Fox let the clock run down to 1:15 before calling Denver’s first timeout, just before Brian Colquitt punted 30 yards to the Baltimore 23. Three plays later, Flacco threw deep down the right side to Jones as safety Rahim Moore misread the flight of the ball.“I have to settle down and let the ball come to me,” said Moore, who came close to crying at his locker. “I misjudged it. It’s my fault. I’m taking the blame for it. I lost the game for us.”Manning and Denver receiver Brandon Stokley understood why Fox let the clock run out in regulation.“Conditions were bad,” Stokley said, referring to the Broncos’ driving into a cold wind. “Their defense was playing pretty well right there. The last thing you want to do is force something and have a turnover in that situation. I think it was the right call. It turned out we had plenty of opportunities in overtime, and we just didn’t do it.”Manning, whose interception late in the first overtime led to Justin Tucker’s winning 47-yard field goal, added of Fox’s decision: “I really don’t have a whole lot of thought on it. We get the ball in overtime. We had chances. We didn’t do it. I made a bad throw and put our defense in a tough spot and a short field. You can’t really point at that, I don’t think.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/hockey/devils-open-training-camp-with-ilya-kovalchuk-still-in-russia.html,"NEWARK — As delighted as the Devils were to begin crash-course preparations Sunday for a 48-game regular season after the lockout, the focus was inevitably on the players who were not there.Zach Parise, the team’s captain the last two years, left a huge void in the locker room and on offense when he joined the Minnesota Wild as a free agent. Parise ranked second on the team in goals last season with 31 and third in points with 69 in helping the Devils advance to the Stanley Cup finals.The concern about how to compensate for the loss of Parise’s scoring touch intensified Sunday when General Manager Lou Lamoriello said that the Devils would not retain the veteran Petr Sykora, an unrestricted free agent who had 21 goals and 44 points last season.“We made a decision over the last 24 to 48 hours,” Lamoriello said. “We’re going to give some kids who played well in the minors an opportunity.”The player most conspicuous in his absence, though, was right wing Ilya Kovalchuk, the team’s most potent scorer, who has 13 years and more than $83 million remaining on a 15-year contract worth $100 million. Kovalchuk was last seen on YouTube figure skating as part of the festivities before the Kontinental Hockey League’s All-Star Game in Russia.Lamoriello said Kovalchuk, who competed for SKA St. Petersburg during the lockout, told him that he would rejoin his teammates in time for Wednesday’s practice. The Devils open the season on the road Saturday against the Islanders.Kovalchuk, 29, had cast doubt on his future with the Devils when he was quoted by Russia’s Sport-Express as saying that he was “not in a hurry to get to America.”He added: “Time will tell. Nothing is out of the question.” He said that he would need to read the new labor agreement before making plans.Lamoriello emphasized that he never had reason to believe that Kovalchuk, viewed as a potential successor to Parise as captain, would not return.“At no time did I have any indication he wasn’t coming back or did not want to come back,” Lamoriello said, noting that the K.H.L. and the N.H.L. had entered into a memorandum of understanding to respect each other’s contracts.Lamoriello said he did not officially grant Kovalchuk permission to be part of the K.H.L. All-Star Game, in order to protect the Devils’ interests in case of an injury, but he also said, “The bottom line is I am comfortable with it.”All players were given a grace period to report because of the uncertainty involving when training camps would open.“He is not in violation of anything whatsoever,” Lamoriello said of Kovalchuk.Coach Peter DeBoer played down Kovalchuk’s absence by pointing out that Kovalchuk did not face conditioning problems because he had been playing steadily.“It’s a nonissue for me or the team,” DeBoer said.Goaltender Martin Brodeur said he did not expect team chemistry to suffer because of Kovalchuk’s absence.“I don’t think it’s a big deal,” he said. “It’s something he wanted to do. I think he sacrificed himself to go overseas and do what he did and he wanted to finish up what he started.”Brodeur added: “Kovie is the type of player, he’s a dominant player. He doesn’t need to be here for seven days. If it was important to him, he stays happy, good.”Kovalchuk had 37 goals and 83 points last season as the Devils finished sixth in the Eastern Conference before making a stirring postseason run. He continued his brisk scoring pace in the playoffs with a team-leading 19 points, matching Parise for the club lead with eight goals.“We don’t know exactly the reason why he stayed there,” the veteran left wing Patrik Elias said of Kovalchuk’s decision to remain in Russia for a few more days. “If it’s O.K. with management, it’s O.K. with us. Obviously, he’s a big part of this team when he comes back.”That does not mean he will be spared the verbal jabs of his teammates after his foray into pairs figure skating. A video shows Kovalchuk, attempting to take his cue from a graceful partner, awkwardly landing a one-turn jump. Toward the end of his appearance, he reached several times for his rear right skate while gliding on his lead leg.“Impressive,” Brodeur said wryly."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/football/falcons-escape-against-seahawks.html,"ATLANTA — Through more than 250 games with two teams in 16 N.F.L. seasons, Tony Gonzalez never cried tears of joy. He saw players on other teams do it, of course, watching with envy as his opponents were so overwhelmed by the emotion of a victory that they wept on their shoulder pads. But for Gonzalez, those tears never came.Until Sunday. As Atlanta Falcons kicker Matt Bryant watched his 49-yard field goal sail between the uprights, Gonzalez fell to the ground. He rolled. He screamed. And then, finally, he cried, giving in to the frenzy of the moment as the Falcons beat the Seattle Seahawks, 30-28, to complete a frantic last-minute rally that came, amazingly, after they had blown a 20-point lead.After enduring seasons of regular-season success doused by January disappointment, it was the first playoff victory for Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan (who had been 0-3), the first for Coach Mike Smith (0-4) and, most especially to many in the Falcons’ locker room, the first for the veteran tight end Gonzalez (0-5), who is considering retiring after this season.Not surprisingly, Gonzalez was hardly the only one stunned in the dressing room afterward, as many of the Atlanta players acknowledged being dazed by what they had just experienced. Playing as the No. 1 seed in the N.F.C., the Falcons came out fast, taking a 20-0 halftime lead. Then they were bulldozed through much of the third and fourth quarters, giving up 21 points in the final period and falling behind, 28-27, when Marshawn Lynch powered into the end zone from 2 yards out with about 30 seconds remaining.At that point, many observers thought it was over, and even some Falcons players conceded they were unsure they would be able to recover from that type of stomach punch. Center Todd McClure said it was difficult not to think that “all that hard work is going down the drain.”But with some Falcons fans heading for the Georgia Dome exits, Jacquizz Rodgers returned the Seahawks’ kickoff to the Atlanta 28, and with 25 seconds on the clock, Ryan went to work.“We always talk about, in those types of situations, let’s make that first play and get going,” he said. And the Falcons did. Ryan found Harry Douglas for 22 yards to midfield. The play took only six seconds.On the next play, Ryan, who recorded 250 passing yards and threw 3 touchdowns and 2 interceptions, dropped back again. Facing a hard Seattle blitz, he stood in the pocket and hit Gonzalez for 19 yards to the Seattle 31 as the Seahawks’ sideline slumped. Smith then took his last timeout and sent out Bryant, who first waited through a Seattle timeout intended to unnerve him, then coolly blasted his kick through to save the Falcons from another postseason disaster. Atlanta will host San Francisco in the N.F.C. championship game Sunday.“This is something that’s been a long time coming,” said Gonzalez, who finished with 6 catches for 51 yards and a touchdown. He added, “A long, long time coming.”Bryant’s kick also spoiled a sensational effort from Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson, who seemed poised to supplant San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick as the brightest young star of the postseason. Wilson led the Seahawks back from a 14-0 deficit last week against Washington and sparkled again, completing 24 of 36 passes for 385 yards and 2 touchdowns. He also rushed for 60 yards and a score.In truth, that the game was even close in the fourth quarter was remarkable, as the Falcons were dominant early on. Their explosive offense showed all its tricks, with Ryan frequently trying long passes downfield — his best was a 47-yard touchdown toss to Roddy White in the second quarter — while running backs Michael Turner and Rodgers mixed hard running through the line with explosive bursts in the open field.“I like the way we started the game,” said Smith, who saw his team blown out by Green Bay two years ago when the Falcons also were the No. 1 seed. “They never quit, and we had one hell of a game.”The Seahawks, meanwhile, could not get out of their own way at the start. Lynch, who lost fumbles only twice during the regular season, coughed up the ball for the second time in two playoff games after an early 11-yard run, allowing the Falcons to capitalize when Ryan found Gonzalez for a touchdown that made the score 10-0. Then, late in the second quarter, Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll made two decisions that will surely be hot topics for a long time in the Pacific Northwest, and, in both cases, left Seattle without precious points.First, Carroll opted to forgo a short field-goal attempt on fourth-and-1 from the Atlanta 11 with a little under six minutes remaining in the first half, keeping his offense on the field but curiously putting the ball in the hands of fullback Michael Robinson — not Lynch or Wilson — on a short-yardage carry. Robinson was stuffed, and the Falcons turned the decision into a touchdown that gave them a 20-0 lead.On the Seahawks’ ensuing possession, Seattle again moved the ball deep into Atlanta territory, but Carroll spent his final timeout of the half after the Seahawks got a first down at the Falcons’ 6 with 25 seconds remaining.That left Carroll with no recourse when Wilson was subsequently sacked on third down — Jonathan Babineaux streaked into the backfield — and the Seahawks failed to get off another play before time expired.“There’s five different opportunities to score points in the first half,” Carroll said, “that would have been the difference in the game.”As it turned out, those 6 points lost certainly would have been valuable. The Seahawks surged in the second half, scoring on their first three possessions — including one that came after Ryan threw a brutal interception into double coverage — and slashed through a Falcons defense that spent much of the game without its top pass rusher, the injured John Abraham.Still, Atlanta steadied itself just in time.It was thrilling. It was sublime. It was enough to bring a 6-foot-5, 250-pound man to tears.“It was crazy,” Gonzalez said. “But I’ll do it again next week if I have to.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/football/russell-wilson-of-seahawks-shows-talent-and-poise-in-loss.html,"ATLANTA — In the morgue silence of the Seattle locker room, several Seahawks sat frozen on folding chairs, staring straight ahead at nothing. A few heads were hidden beneath white towels. One player sniffled.The rookie quarterback, in stark contrast, casually slipped into a patterned, conservative three-piece suit as if dressing for a day in the corner office. Russell Wilson’s demeanor belied the fact that he had just engineered a comeback of the highest drama, only to have it trumped by Atlanta’s beat-the-clock field goal in a 30-28 Falcons playoff victory Sunday.“Obviously, very disappointing,” Wilson said. “We had high, high hopes for the rest of the season.” But the gloom was fleeting. As he walked off the Georgia Dome field and into the tunnel afterward, Wilson gushed to the quarterbacks coach Carl Smith how excited he already was about his sophomore season.In the huddle, Wilson’s mantra is to move on to the next play. Evidently, he lives it, too.“The greatest thing about it is, we get to look forward to the next opportunity,” he said.Anyone tuning into Sunday’s game after swearing off the N.F.L. since the draft last April might have thought he was viewing a piece of fiction. Wilson was the 75th choice — 74 behind Andrew Luck and 73 after Robert Griffin III, quarterbacks who entered the league with far more acclaim — and height.Third-round selections are not supposed to start immediately at the increasingly complex position, much less advance their teams into title contention. Yet Seattle had won six straight games, averaging 33 points, while becoming a fashionable pick to surface in the Super Bowl.An analysis of the first half Sunday, after which the Seahawks trailed by 20-0, would not have revealed rookie jitters as the chief cause of Seattle’s situation. Tailback Marshawn Lynch’s lost fumble in Falcons territory poisoned one drive. Two others just before the break were capsized in the red zone by a pair of failed runs in short-yardage situations — neither, oddly, involving Lynch, who had exceeded 100 rushing yards in five straight games — and a coaching faux pas when the Seahawks neglected to save a timeout in case of a quarterback sack.When Wilson was dumped at the Atlanta 20 with about 12 seconds remaining, he could not reset the offense in time for another snap. For Seattle, the half could not have expired more frustratingly.“I still knew we were going to win,” Wilson said. “At least, that’s what I thought.”The sentiment was widely shared, especially by two frequent Wilson targets: wide receiver Golden Tate and tight end Zach Miller, who each scored a touchdown and exceeded 100 receiving yards.“At no point did we think the game was over with,” Tate said.Miller added, “For being down what we were, we were pretty positive at halftime.”When the game resumed, Miller said, the voice in charge of the huddle kept emphasizing the one-play-at-a-time approach.“Just focus on the next one,” Miller said. Once momentum was mustered, Miller added, “I felt like nothing could stop us.”In the final two quarters, Wilson connected on 14 for 19 passes for 241 yards while splicing in 34 more yards on five scrambles. The scoring marches covered 80, 80, 62 and 61 yards, not a single one offering Seattle’s offense a shortcut after a turnover or lengthy kick return.“I love it when the game is on the line,” Wilson said, “when everyone else is nervous and I’m excited.”Upon Lynch’s 2-yard score that lifted Seattle ahead, 28-27, only 31 seconds separated Wilson from an N.F.C. Championship game, well after Luck and Griffin had closed shop for the season.Amid the disappointment of defeat, Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll rolled out the superlatives for Wilson, calling him incredible and amazing, just for starters.“It is unheard-of for rookies to do stuff like that, but he ain’t a rookie,” Carroll said. “He is just good.”As Wilson’s more distraught teammates were breaking out of their catatonic state and coming out from under the towels, he was displaying little emotion for the news media.“To start as a rookie, to grow so much, to play at a high level was great for me,” he said.From Wilson, who finished with 385 passing yards, the words rang modestly sincere, conveyed in such a tone that no Seahawks player would take offense.He was businesslike all the while, except for a moment by his locker. When someone found his wedding ring on the floor and handed it over, Wilson sighed with relief and thanked him.Today marks his one-year anniversary. For the workaholic who is loath to take a day off, Wilson alluded to a blessing from the loss: he and wife, Ashton, finally can go on a honeymoon."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/football/patriots-ground-game-runs-over-texans.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — He figured he would at least play. That much Shane Vereen thought he could count on for the Patriots’ playoff opener Sunday against the Houston Texans. He had earned that much with his play during the regular season, hadn’t he?This wasn’t 2011, when he was a rookie running back out of California, appearing in just five games, bothered by a hamstring injury. This time last year he was a spectator when New England made its run to the Super Bowl in Indianapolis.This time around, if the Patriots are to get to another Super Bowl — and they are one home victory from a trip to New Orleans — Vereen plans to be a lot more than just your basic wallflower. He signaled his arrival Sunday against the Texans, shining brightly in the constellation of New England stars in a 41-28 victory.In his first N.F.L. playoff game, Vereen scored three touchdowns, two on pass receptions. He had 124 all-purpose yards. He rushed for 41 yards on seven carries, scoring on a 1-yard run.“Shane had a great game,” Patriots quarterback Tom Brady said, “really just a huge growing-up moment for him.”But the way Vereen saw it, he was doing what every Patriot does when called upon: the job they pay you to do. Nothing more. Nothing less.“Guys go down, guys step in,” Vereen said. “That’s what you’re expected to do.”Then, in a rare moment of non-Patriot speak, he acknowledged, “Yeah, it was a fun game for me.”Vereen got the call when the starter, Danny Woodhead, hurt his thumb on the Patriots’ first play from scrimmage. Before the game, Vereen had no idea how much he would play, if he would even get a carry or be targeted by Brady coming out of the backfield. He got all of that and more.Woodhead did not return. The Patriots went three-and-out on that series, but when they reassembled for their next series, Vereen was in the backfield.“We hate to lose Woody,” Vereen said. “He is such a key part of our offense. But at the same time, all of the running backs hold ourselves accountable to be able to step up when somebody does go down.”If he was stunned or shocked to be in there so soon, it did not show. In contrast to last season, he was ready for prime time. He missed the first three games and then appeared in the final 13. He had three rushing touchdowns and one memorable 83-yard pass reception for a touchdown against the Jets on Thanksgiving night.He was in the mix in 2012. He was also part of a four-headed running monster as the Patriots had one of their best running seasons in years and Stevan Ridley amassed the fourth-highest rushing total (1,263 yards) in franchise history.Vereen and Ridley shared the running duties against the Texans, and each averaged 5.5 yards a carry or better. Ridley (82 yards on 15 carries) finished with just 8 fewer yards — and 7 fewer carries — than his Texans counterpart, Arian Foster.Ridley had one of the Patriots’ five touchdowns, an 8-yard burst in the third quarter that gave New England a 24-13 lead. But the deal clincher of the game came courtesy of Vereen, who took advantage of an isolation play on Texans linebacker Barrett Ruud. Brady laid out a perfect float pass, and Vereen, a step ahead of Ruud, pulled it in, tumbling into the end zone.The touchdown, Vereen’s third of the game, gave New England a 38-13 lead less than three minutes into the final quarter.“I don’t know if that was the dagger,” Vereen said. “Their offense was still producing. It was a good call and we executed it. The matchup is in my favor, so I have to do a great job of getting open. When your number is called, you’re expected to go out there and execute, to do well.”Or, as Coach Bill Belichick said: “These kinds of games, you never really know when the dial spins, where it’s going to wind up, who it’s going to end up on. Those guys were prepared.”Vereen also benefited from the Patriots’ emphasis on the running game in 2012. They finished seventh in rushing in the N.F.L. and third in the A.F.C. Ridley was the conference’s third-leading rusher and seventh over all. The team had 151 rushing first downs, second most in franchise history.Brady attempted 40 passes Sunday, while Ridley and Vereen accounted for 22 rushes. Ridley was a force in the third quarter (49 yards) and then was a plow horse in the fourth when the Patriots were running out the clock.New England will host the Ravens on Sunday and are likely to be without tight end Rob Gronkowski, who may have broken his arm again. The status of Woodhead was unknown.But Vereen and Ridley will be back for a crack at the Super Bowl. They may not get the attention of the more marquee members of the offense, but they have shown that they can be every bit as critical."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/tennis/caroline-wozniacki-a-former-no-1-is-seeking-stability.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia — It has been the right time for some long, hard looks in the mirror for Caroline Wozniacki, long No. 1 but now No. 10.And as if to underscore the point, there were reflective surfaces available in abundance Sunday as Wozniacki posed and swatted tennis balls on behalf of a sponsor on a court specially constructed of mirrored acrylic in a west Melbourne warehouse.In the last year, Wozniacki has dropped in the rankings, getting passed by her elders (Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova) and her peer group (Victoria Azarenka and Agnieszka Radwanska). She has struggled more in the major tournaments she has yet to win; hired and fired two coaches and even generated undesirable and, from her point of view, unexpected headlines in Brazil for imitating Serena Williams’s full figure during an exhibition.“I was definitely surprised when it got blown out of proportion,” she said.But Wozniacki still gets the star treatment: chauffeured cars, coteries of well-coiffed assistants hovering to ensure her new tennis frock looked just right as the music pulsed through the warehouse turned carnival funhouse.It is her natural milieu: Wozniacki, now 22, has been in the spotlight since she was 12 years old and a Danish television crew arrived for a profile.But it is only one of her natural milieus. Wozniacki can shift social gears in an impressive hurry, and her next stop on her Sunday tour was a down-market municipal tennis club in east Melbourne where a small group of Australian representatives from her racket company, many with beer bottles in hand, waited in T-shirts to pose for photographs with Wozniacki and the former Australian Open champion Martina Hingis.“It was a bit different,” Wozniacki said of the transition. “But it was quick and easy. It wasn’t painful at all.”Wozniacki’s plan for 2013 is to minimize the pain and the confusion; to restore clarity to her game and stability to her off-court structure. She does not intend to rehire another full-time or part-time coach after her experiments last year with Ricardo Sanchez and Thomas Johansson. She said her primary coach for the foreseeable future would be her father, Piotr, and she will continue to seek advice from the Adidas coaches Sven Groeneveld and his assistant Mats Merkel.This was her system when she finished No. 1 in 2010 and 2011, and she is now sticking with it, which is no novelty in a sport where father-daughter coaching relationships have long been a staple: from Chris Evert to the Williams sisters to the Frenchwoman Marion Bartoli.“For sure trust is a big thing, and he’s also worked with me on the court for so many years, and he knows me best on and off the court,” Wozniacki said of Piotr. “It’s great to have him there. It’s been working well. I like that comfort team around me, and I think I would like to keep it that way for now.”Darren Cahill, the ESPN analyst who also coaches for Adidas and knows the family well, expressed support for the move.“There has to be stability in the camp,” Cahill said last week. “I think you’ll find that Piotr is a very intelligent man. I think you’ll find that he gets a bit of a hard time because of his whole coaching scenario. But Caroline is just as strong-minded as what Piotr is, and she wants Piotr around. She wants her dad in charge of her career.”After struggling for much of 2012, particularly in the Grand Slam events, where she lost in the first round at Wimbledon and the United States Open, Wozniacki finished the season on a roll: winning in Seoul, South Korea, and Moscow and salvaging her spot in the top 10.But so far, 2013 has not been promising. She lost to Ksenia Pervak in Brisbane in the first round and to Svetlana Kuznetsova in Sydney in the second round. She also has one of the roughest first-round draws of any leading player at the Australian Open: she will play Sabine Lisicki, the powerful but erratic German, on Tuesday.“If you look at my record in Sydney, it’s not great,” Wozniacki said of her slow start. “So it’s not a big surprise to me. I always got here with the thought of just getting the rust out of the body and kind of just get going with points and try to get a feel of how the girls hit it and stuff.”The leading women have often hit it harder under pressure than Wozniacki, a rugged defender, and she attributes some of her results in 2012 to both nagging injuries and to going for too much in an attempt to produce the winners that she hoped might lead to her first Grand Slam singles title.“You just realize you need to stick with what works for you and why you win, because not everybody has to hit every ball as hard as they can,” she said. “I think just growing up you just get that feeling for yourself what your game is. And I’ve always been physically strong and fast, and I just need to take that to my advantage.“Sometimes last year I was just taking too many chances, unnecessary chances, and losing some important balls and making stupid mistakes. You just keep playing, keep being the wall, be aggressive when you have to. Don’t hit shots you can’t hit when you are out of balance.”If you imagine Wozniacki in a somber mood as she talks through her tennis troubles, that would be incorrect. Over the course of Sunday’s installment-plan interview, ferrying between her commitments, she was quick with a joke and particularly quick to tease — from afar — Rory McIlroy, the star golfer from Northern Ireland whom she has been dating for more than a year. Their mutual Twitter feeds are testimony to their harmony, including a Christmas photograph of them dressed in T-shirts that read “Geek”(McIlroy) and “Nerd” (Wozniacki). There can be no doubt, however, which member of the pair had the better sporting year: McIlroy won a second major at the P.G.A. Championship as well as the Ryder Cup with the European team and returned to No. 1.“It’s definitely inspirational, and I get more nervous watching him play than I do when I play myself because I don’t know what’s going to happen,” she said. “But definitely I can learn from him and how the golfers approach things and how he approaches things and how he practices and how focused he is. So I think we can learn something from each other.”That includes each other’s sports. Wozniacki deigns to play tennis with McIlroy and intends to win her bet soon that she can beat him left-handed. McIlroy deigns to play golf with her, as they did last month at the Bears Club in Florida, when Wozniacki nearly holed her first shot of the day on a par-3 course without any warm-up.“I take the 9-iron and the ball is going and I can just see Rory going, ‘No way! Oh my God!’ So the ball lands so close to the hole and just passes it, and he was like, ‘I’m kind of happy you didn’t make that because you know that first shot, I don’t want you to have that upper hand.’ ”But Wozniacki’s mood soon became more serious when the interview turned to her imitation of Williams during the exhibition in Brazil in December. As a joke, she stuffed her tennis clothes to imitate Williams’s ample curves (Williams was also taking part in the exhibition). But some commentators in the United States suggested that the imitation was racist, an accusation Wozniacki denies.“It’s been done a million times before by different players,” Wozniacki said of the imitation. “I would never have done it if I didn’t know Serena well. Obviously I know Serena very well. She’s a funny girl, and I knew she would take it with a smile and wouldn’t have anything against it.”Wozniacki said she was stunned by the reaction, which Williams eventually addressed in an e-mail to USA Today, saying that she did not believe her friend Wozniacki meant “anything racist by it” but that given some of the public response, perhaps Wozniacki should “take reason and do something different next time.”Wozniacki, who has spoken little of the issue publicly, said she appreciated Williams’s supportive comments and agreed she would need to be more careful.“Obviously people don’t have the same mind-set as we do,” Wozniacki said. “And sometimes people maybe think more of it. You just need to think an extra time next time when you do something.”Asked if it was a pity that she had to edit herself to such a degree, Wozniacki answered: “It is because there is nothing really in that that I saw as racist or anything, so obviously I think it’s a pity you can’t just have a bit of fun. You have to think three times, not only twice, but three times before you do anything.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/soccer/soccer-roundup.html,"Manchester United’s seven-point lead over its neighbor Manchester City stayed intact after the title-chasing rivals downed two of the Premier League’s fallen giants in contrasting ways on Sunday.While United scraped out a nervy 2-1 win over visiting Liverpool, City cruised to a 2-0 victory at Arsenal after playing against 10 men for most of the match.Laurent Koscielny’s ninth-minute red card for wrestling Edin Dzeko to the ground inside the area proved decisive for City, even though Dzeko missing the resulting penalty. Dzeko later tapped in a rebound to supplement an opening goal by James Milner. The only negative for City after its first league win at Arsenal in 38 years was the red card awarded to its captain, Vincent Kompany. He faces a three-game suspension after he was sent off for a two-footed tackle.Robin van Persie started United on the way to victory over Liverpool at Old Trafford with his league-leading 17th goal of the season. Nemanja Vidic unwittingly made it 2-0 when Patrice Evra’s header went in off the back of his head, but United had to resort to some desperate defending to preserve the lead after the substitute Daniel Sturridge scored for Liverpool.“The name of the game is winning,” United Manager Alex Ferguson said. “There are moments where you have to defend. Today was one of them.”Arsenal Manager Arsène Wenger, who saw his team drop to sixth place, said the growing pressure to perform from the crowd at the Emirates Stadium was showing up in his team’s play. Arsenal has won only 4 of its 11 home matches in the league, and the pressure from fans to win something after a seven-year trophy drought is growing.“We are a bit too nervous to play in a serene way at home, and that shows in the way we start the games,” Wenger said, adding, “I feel we wanted to do so well, but we are a bit uptight.”Many pundits had predicted that this weekend would be a pivotal moment in the title race, but United’s lead is unchanged with 16 matches still to play. Chelsea, a 4-0 winner at Stoke on Saturday, can keep alive its hopes of catching the Manchester clubs by beating Southampton on Wednesday, but it would still trail United by 11 points.MESSI LEADS BARCELONA In his first game since winning an unprecedented fourth Ballon d’Or as world player of the year, Lionel Messi scored one goal and set up two more to steer Barcelona to a 3-1 win at Málaga. Barcelona (18-0-1) improved to 10-0 away from home this season and maintained its 11-point lead over Atlético Madrid, which beat Real Zaragoza, 2-0. Real Madrid is a distant third, 18 points back."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/baseball/giants-left-their-hearts-at-coogans-bluff.html,"Once they were the darlings of Coogan’s Bluff, but now the San Francisco Giants are the darlings of a bar in New York’s East Village as well as thousands of passionate baseball fans back East who stay up late to root.For the last two decades, the Giants have acknowledged their inner Christy Mathewson, their inner Monte Irvin, as part of their heritage. Did this help them win the World Series in 2010 and 2012? Well, Posey and Sandoval did not hurt.A cadre of Giants, including one Willie Howard Mays Jr., will return to the ancestral home in the next week to be honored for the most recent Series victory. This organization is touching all the spiritual bases.During the World Series of 2010, I wandered the halls in the ballpark in China Basin and loved seeing old photographs of wondrous doings in a far-off time and land — Mel Ott, Sal Maglie. The Giants had names from their glorious past tossing out the first ball — McCovey, Cepeda, Perry, Marichal, Irvin, Bobby Thomson’s family, Dave Dravecky. They invited Barry Bonds, who is part of the history. A few days later, they polished off the Texas Rangers for their first championship since Leo Durocher and Dusty Rhodes in 1954. I wrote a column that began with two words: Karma counts.“There was a ticker-tape parade in 1958,” said Larry Baer, the president of the Giants, who cherishes history as a partner of profit. “We replicated that in 2010.”Baer and the current ownership also honored the haunts of the ancient past. Two years ago, Mays visited Public School 46 in Harlem, where the Polo Grounds once stood. This week, Buster Posey will make a private visit to the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center in Little Falls, N.J., for some catcher talk.The Giants are coming home for a visit. That is their attitude, and it is a marvelous one. By honoring their past, they have illuminated their present. At the moment, they generate more emotional wattage in New York than the franchise hunkered down in the marshes of Flushing.Does karma really matter? Why did it take 86 years for the Boston Red Sox to get past the disposal of Babe Ruth? What miasma hangs over the North Side of Chicago? How long will the creepy smirk of Bernie Madoff haunt the Mets?For a long time, the Giants seemed haunted by some malediction from their departure from New York. At the same time, the Los Angeles Dodgers, pursued by outright hatred from Brooklyn for being the alleged instigators of the move to California, won five World Series while the Giants failed, often with comparable talent.In 1992, with the team facing a possible move to Florida, Peter Magowan of Safeway, a New Yorker who had coincidentally moved to San Francisco in 1958, joined a new ownership team put together by Baer. (There are now 32 owners, with Charles B. Johnson, chairman of Franklin Resources, the largest single shareholder.)“We wanted to celebrate the connections to New York, and not deny it or minimize it,” said Baer, comparing his hometown, San Francisco, to New York, where he worked for a decade. I told Baer I have always thought of San Francisco, with its bustling waterfront, as European — Genoa or Istanbul or Naples or Barcelona.“When you live in Northern California, this big thing, this elephant in the room, is the rivalry with L.A.,” Baer said. “We feel more like New York or Boston. We think of ourselves as a city. The City. Longtime San Franciscans call it the City. L.A. is the biggest city in California, but we are a city like New York or Boston, with a central business district, people go downtown for entertainment, to the opera, the symphony, the theater, the ballpark.” He also compared New York and San Francisco because of ingenuity, electronics, energy.Some of this is marketing babble, but the Giants made the visceral connection with an expedition to deepest Gotham in January 2011 for the baseball writers’ annual dinner, and they came bearing superstars and hardware.They also had the acuity to accept an invitation from a sports bar, Finnerty’s on East 14th Street. Two new owners, Brian Stapleton and Dieter Seelig, had been renovating its East Village funk for a year, trying to induce patrons to stop and have a beer, anything. One bartender invited some friends of hers to root for the San Francisco 49ers on Sundays, and some began coming back for the Giants.“Ten-thirty on weekday nights,” Seelig said the other day. “We’re open till 4 a.m., and sometimes, those games don’t end till 3 a.m. The night Matt Cain pitched his perfect game, people began coming over at midnight and stayed till the end. We must have had 60 people here.”Finnerty’s gained a reputation as a Giants bar, much the way there is a trend toward soccer pubs for specific teams, cricket and rugby pubs, Steelers bars, college football bars, you name it, Seelig said.Could the success and new bicoastal reach of the Giants cut into the popularity of the Mets? What popularity? you ask. The cash-poor Mets are trudging into the new season without one legitimate major league outfielder, not a good omen in Front-Runner City.Seelig says Finnerty’s sends busloads of Giants fans to Queens — 200 tickets for each of four Giants games last April. Many of his patrons are transplants from the Bay Area, Seelig added, saying, “I don’t think they’d become Met or Yankee fans.” He does not see the Giants as a threat to the Mets. It’s all good for business, he suggested.Are the Giants touching hearts and minds back East? Stan Isaacs, the great sports columnist at Newsday for many decades, grew up a Giants fan — in Brooklyn, no less. Isaacs, 83, said he hated Horace Stoneham for moving the franchise, but added that recently, “I was delighted by the act of emblazoning the words of Russ Hodges — ‘the Giants win the pennant,’ the historic call,” from 1951, in faraway San Francisco. The Giants painted the quotation on a wall of the ballpark’s club level. Isaacs admits it: he’s rooting for his old team again.Christopher Russo, the Mad Dog himself, now yapping away weekday afternoons on SiriusXM satellite radio, has been a Giants fan since childhood, long after the team’s defection. Russo can recite the horrors of 1993 and the 2000 postseason loss to the Mets, as well as the nastiness of the Bonds era. This team, Russo pronounced, “is likable,” and has won two Series. “I never thought I’d see the day,” the Mad Dog barked.The Giants might also be candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, having brought together opposing Giants fan clubs. This sounds like one of those New York jokes (“that other congregation, you wouldn’t catch me dead in”), but this schism really exists between the New York Baseball Giants Nostalgia Society and the New York Giants Preservation Society, offshoots of a faded group whose name must not be spoken.Having once covered religion, I felt right at home delving into this. The Nostalgia people are a mix of old fans and young fans who meet periodically to talk about the Giants. For that matter, so are the Preservation people.When the Giants come to New York, both groups will meet Mays & Company at a Midtown hotel. Together. “They have a truce,” Baer said. “A détente.”Bill Kent is the leader of the Nostalgia group. The highlight of his early childhood was watching the lumbering slugger Ernie Lombardi chasing a pal of Kent’s around the field during batting practice. (Old Giants fans know right away that the Schnozz never did catch the little kid.) Kent says that at meetings of the Nostalgia group, “We go into the twilight zone” and become little kids again.Gary Mintz is the leader of the Preservation group. He is 51, a schoolteacher, and honors the Giants in memory of his dad, Louis. “I’d wake up every morning and ask him the score” from the Giants’ West Coast games, Mintz said in a husky voice. Last year, a group of Preservation people made the hegira to San Francisco and were honored before the game. Then Magowan led the group into the glass-enclosed office of the clubhouse manager Miguel Murphy, who has worked for the team since 1958. There, the Preservation people got to shake hands with Mays. Mintz is still glowing.Murphy’s office may be the emotional center of the franchise. He has been there since Seals Stadium, since Candlestick Park, and now China Basin, and knows all the secrets. Ownership has encouraged him to make his office the home for former players. I do not know any other major franchise where old-timers gather so routinely.“For any home game, Willie Mays and Willie McCovey are there,” Baer said. “Plus Orlando Cepeda, Will Clark, Vida Blue, plus visual depictions of Mathewson, McGraw.” He says it is funny to watch a new Giant take a gulp of air and tiptoe into Murphy’s sanctum and introduce himself to one or more deities who tell him to sit down and talk awhile.“We’re not just winning for the 25 guys in uniform today but also for the hundreds or thousands of guys who have worn the uniform over 131 years,” Baer said.Baer says the Giants are no threat to the popularity of the Mets or the Yankees. Nonetheless, they will surely sell tickets as they visit the two boroughs (Queens, Sept. 17-19, and the Bronx, Sept. 20-22). Six Giants games in their old city in 2013. They’re not moving back to Coogan’s Bluff, but they have honored their roots. Karma still counts."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/tennis/australian-open-roundup.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia — A routine first-round match at the Australian Open on Tuesday suddenly turned into a bit of a scare midway through the first set when Serena Williams rolled her right ankle.Leading Edina Gallovits-Hall of Romania by 4-0, Williams was pulled into the short court by a slice backhand by Gallovits-Hall. Gallovits-Hall then swept a wide forehand to the far court. Williams stretched but lost her balance and fell to the court.The injury was similar to one that hobbled Williams last year right before the Open, where she was largely immobile during a 6-2, 6-3 fourth-round defeat against Ekaterina Makarova. It was one of only four matches she lost last year.On Tuesday, the third-seeded Williams laid flat on her back for about 30 seconds before the chair umpire, Kerrilyn Cramer, and Gallovits-Hall came over to assist. A trainer cut the thick tape off her ankle and called a medical timeout to apply heavier tape. Eight minutes later, Williams strode back onto court and breezed to a 6-0, 6-0 victory in only 54 minutes.“I haven’t had enough time to assess it yet,” Williams said. “Saw the doctor again. We’re just gonna see how it is in a few hours from now.”Williams was resolute about playing a second-round match.“Oh, I’ll be out there,” she said. “I mean, unless something fatal happens to me, there’s no way I’m not going to be competing. I’m alive. My heart’s beating. I’ll be fine.”AZARENKA ROLLS Victoria Azarenka opened the defense of her Australian Open title with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Monica Niculescu of Romania.In other women’s matches, Kimiko Date-Krumm, 42, upset No. 12-seeded Nadia Petrova of Russia 6-2, 6-0, becoming the oldest winner of a women’s singles match at the tournament, and the former No. 1-ranked Caroline Wozniacki won the last six games to beat Sabine Lisicki of Germany 2-6, 6-3, 6-3.Svetlana Kuznetsova, the former United States Open and French Open champion, continued her comeback from a knee injury that kept her out of the United States Open, beating Lourdes Dominguez Lino, 6-2, 6-1. Also, No. 14 Maria Kirilenko had a 6-4, 6-2 win over Vania King, and China’s Peng Shuai beat Canada’s Rebecca Marino 6-3, 6-0.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/football/nfc-falcons-offense-relies-on-long-ball.html,"As the Atlanta Falcons prepare for Sunday’s N.F.C. Championship game against San Francisco, the focus for many observers will be on the 49ers’ ability to score points. This makes sense; quarterback Colin Kaepernick, after all, shredded Green Bay’s defense in the divisional round and outgunned Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, one of the league’s premier producers of big plays.But the Falcons, despite having far less of a postseason pedigree than the other teams still alive in the N.F.L. playoffs, might just have the most explosive offense of all. Yes, the New England Patriots clearly score at a pace far greater than anyone else — their 34.8 points per game this season was the most by nearly 5 points — yet when it comes to long passes, quarterback Matt Ryan and the Falcons succeed at a better rate than any of the teams still playing.Ryan, according to data compiled by the Web site Pro Football Focus, has completed 43.3 percent of his passes aimed more than 20 yards down the field this season. (For the purposes of evaluating quarterbacks, the Web site includes dropped passes in that completion percentage.) That places him sixth over all among N.F.L. quarterbacks, and first among those who will play in the conference title games Sunday. In that group, New England’s Tom Brady has the second-best percentage, 40.5.As the Falcons built their 20-0 and 27-7 leads over the Seattle Seahawks and then had to rally after squandering them, Atlanta relied on the big play. Ryan continually took shots down the field — averaging a career-high 12.1 yards per target, according to ESPN Stats and Information — and was ultimately rewarded with a 30-28 win, his first postseason victory. He threw for 250 yards and 3 touchdowns, including a 47-yarder to Roddy White.Of course, having a receiving roster that includes White, Julio Jones and tight end Tony Gonzalez gives Ryan the opportunity to throw downfield with confidence. Gonzalez, who caught a 19-yard pass that set up Matt Bryant’s winning field goal Sunday, said the White-Jones combination even approached the celebrated 49ers tandem of Jerry Rice and John Taylor in terms of talent.“They’re up there too, and it’s just beginning,” Gonzalez said last week. “These two guys have a chance to do something incredible.”The Falcons’ success on downfield plays is by design, a practiced component of the coordinator Dirk Koetter’s offense. Koetter, who replaced the much-maligned Mike Mularkey before this season, has always preached the value of impact plays and pushes his units to seize upon opportunities to gain big chunks of yardage all at once.For that sort of plan to work, a team needs a quarterback with a big arm — which Ryan certainly has — and dynamic receivers. Some might consider the Giants’ Hakeem Nicks and Victor Cruz to be the best receiver combination in the league, but White dismissed that notion this season, saying that Cruz was more of a slot receiver and that “the big boys play on the outside.”In other words, the Falcons’ receivers know their value and are not afraid to talk about it. Against the Seahawks, Jones finished with 59 yards receiving, and White recorded 76. White spent most of the day battling for space with Seattle’s star cornerback Richard Sherman, and the two — neither of whom is shy about talking trash — yapped at each other throughout the game. When White burned Sherman for his long touchdown catch, he showed his satisfaction by preening in front of the frustrated defensive back.“He’s a talker,” White said. “He’s a bit of a talker, so I just asked him to talk to me for a little while. He didn’t have too much to say after that play.”The Falcons can expect a challenge to their passing game against the 49ers, as San Francisco significantly improved its secondary from 2011 and finished the regular season allowing the fourth-fewest passing yards a game. The 49ers have also been stingy against the big play, giving up just 38 plays of 20 yards or more, tied for the third fewest in the N.F.L.Then again, the Seahawks were pretty good in that area during the regular season, too, allowing just 40. Yet the Falcons managed to pull off three such passing plays.On Monday, after watching film of the victory, Coach Mike Smith pointed to Ryan’s throw to White, which went some 50 yards in the air, as the latest proof that the deep ball was an integral part of what the Falcons did.“We’ve been saying since the season started that Matt, we felt like, was stronger,” Smith said. “I thought that was one of the best long balls he’s thrown all season long.”EXTRA POINTSThe Falcons played most of Sunday’s game without their top pass-rusher, defensive end John Abraham, who reinjured his ankle early on. The Falcons struggled to contain Seattle quarterback Russell Wilson without Abraham, and Mike Smith said Monday that he hoped Abraham would return to practice later this week. Abraham said he expected to play against San Francisco."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/football/ravens-turn-focus-to-avenging-loss-to-patriots-that-still-stings.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata said he tried to be a dispassionate observer of the divisional playoff game between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans. As he watched the game on television, Ngata studied both offenses, at least until the third quarter, when it became clear that the Patriots were well on their way to securing a rematch with the Ravens in Sunday’s A.F.C. Championship game.At that point, Ngata allowed himself to feel some emotion.“I think we personally wanted to play the Patriots again,” he said Monday at the Ravens’ training site. “If we were to go to the Super Bowl, it would be great to go through Foxborough and win there.”The two teams are familiar dance partners in the N.F.L. playoffs, and their postseason tangle last January — a 23-20 Patriots victory at Gillette Stadium — has served as fuel for the Ravens ever since. Baltimore had its opportunities in that game, so many opportunities. There was wide receiver Lee Evans, his go-ahead touchdown reception stripped by a Patriots defender with 23 seconds remaining. And there was kicker Billy Cundiff, his chance to send the game to overtime evaporating when his 32-yard field-goal attempt veered wide left.Neither player stuck with the team over the off-season, though the bad feelings — all the would-haves, could-haves, should-haves — have lingered. Offensive lineman Marshal Yanda said it took him two months to get over the loss. Ngata said he could still remember what it felt like in the locker room, the quiet despair.“It’s been a long road getting back to this point,” tight end Dennis Pitta said. “The way we left it last year didn’t sit well with us.”Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo added some heat to the inevitable pregame buildup when he shared a few observations on Twitter late Sunday. “New England does some suspect stuff on offense,” Ayanbadejo wrote. “Can’t really respect it.” He also called the Patriots’ hurry-up offense a “gimmick.” On Monday, Ayanbadejo apologized for his comments, also via Twitter. He was not made available to the news media.The Ravens immediately sought to distance themselves from Ayanbadejo’s comments, treating the issue like a hazmat disaster. Coach John Harbaugh dismissed it as “not relevant” and “not worthy of a conversation.” Ngata also declined to weigh in. “That’s all about him and his deal,” he said of Ayanbadejo.If nothing else, the Ravens have shown an uncanny ability to overcome challenges. The word “resilience” has become an unofficial slogan. In reaching the rarefied air of the conference championship round, the Ravens did not always play the most aesthetically pleasing brand of football — or even win all that consistently. Pitta referred to the team’s late-season, three-game losing streak, “when nobody thought we would win another game.” It was a stretch of futility that cost the offensive coordinator Cam Cameron his job, so unsettled was the Ravens’ state of affairs.Yet the team somehow managed to reassemble enough confidence when it mattered most. After defeating the Indianapolis Colts in the wild-card round, the Ravens went to Denver for Saturday’s divisional playoff round and proceeded to stage one of the most dramatic upsets in franchise history. Their 38-35 double-overtime victory over the Broncos assured Harbaugh of his third trip to the A.F.C. Championship game in five seasons as the team’s coach.It took some magic. Joe Flacco threw a 70-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones with 31 seconds remaining to force overtime, and the rookie kicker Justin Tucker — Cundiff’s replacement — made a game-winning 47-yard field goal to cap the fourth-longest game in N.F.L. history. “I’ve never been nervous about Justin Tucker kicking a field goal,” Ngata said.The game was a test of endurance amplified by the fact that it was played at altitude, in the thin air of Denver and in bone-numbing cold. Ngata said he expected the Ravens to benefit from an extra day of rest before facing the Patriots.Still, the Ravens are not traveling the most forgiving route to a potential Super Bowl berth. One week after dismissing the Broncos’ Peyton Manning, Baltimore will be forced to deal with Tom Brady — two generation-defining quarterbacks, back to back. So Ngata could be forgiven for misspeaking Monday when he said the Ravens must “put some pressure on Peyton — uh, Brady.”In Week 3, the Patriots traveled to Baltimore, blew a 9-point fourth-quarter lead and lost, 31-30, as Flacco threw for 382 yards. Harbaugh said he was not putting a lot of stock in that result. Too much has happened in the interim.“Heck of a challenge,” Harbaugh said, adding: “This is a team that changes a lot. They’re kind of like a chameleon.”Given all that has happened in recent weeks, Harbaugh was asked if he thought the Ravens were a team of destiny. Did he believe in such talk?“Our destiny right now is to go to Foxborough,” he said. “That’s the destiny that we’ve earned.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/golf/rory-mcilroy-announces-deal-with-nike-golf.html,"Rory McIlroy’s rocket ride to immortality publicly entered its second phase Monday with the official announcement of his sponsorship with Nike, whose equipment and apparel he will exhibit starting this week at his 2013 debut beside Tiger Woods, Nike’s first golfing icon, in the United Arab Emirates.To reach the next stratosphere of stardom, McIlroy, 23, of Northern Ireland, had to separate from Titleist, the club and ball manufacturer that got him started, and ride the global marketing might of Nike, which, he said in a news conference, “has always been associated with the best athletes in the world.”McIlroy, the world No. 1 and the only active golfer younger than 40 other than Woods to have at least two major titles, joins a constellation of sports superstars representing the swoosh label that includes Woods, the tennis player Roger Federer and the Miami Heat’s LeBron James. “It’s a proud moment for me, and something I’ve been looking forward to,” McIlroy said.The terms of the deal were not disclosed, but the contract is reported to be worth as much as $100 million over five years to $250 million over 10 years provided McIlroy reaches a long list of incentives. Although the money is mind-boggling, McIlroy suggested that his motivation was less about building his bank account than his brand when he said: “It’s a company and a brand that really resonates with me. It’s young. It’s athletic. It’s innovative. They are committed to being the best, as am I. Signing with Nike is another step towards living out my dream.”The path of golfers who have cashed in on their success by changing equipment is well-traveled and includes Phil Mickelson, who moved to Callaway from Titleist in the wake of his victory at the 2004 Masters, and McIlroy’s countryman Graeme McDowell, who jumped to Cleveland and Srixon from Callaway after winning the 2010 United States Open.Mickelson won four times on tour in 2005. The adjustment is not always so seamless. It took McDowell nearly two years to record his first victory with his new clubs. Golf being equal parts mechanical and mental, it is impossible to predict how a new club will affect a player’s swing or scores.Change always carries risk, but McDowell has little reason to fret for McIlroy. “I think 20 years ago, it would have been a monster move and perhaps a mistake,” McDowell said last month. “I think as we sit here, there’s about 6, 8, 10 golf manufacturers on the planet that are making incredibly good equipment, and I don’t think there’s such a thing as inferior equipment nowadays.”McIlroy, who had four PGA Tour victories in 2012, including his second major, said he had thoroughly tested the Nike equipment and was buoyed by the results. “I’m getting more distance out of the driver and the ball,” he said. “I’m comfortable with the irons.” He added, “I’m excited to put the clubs in play.”McIlroy and Woods have forged a friendship, but McIlroy insisted he was not influenced by Woods. “I didn’t speak about it to Tiger,” he said, adding, “We didn’t talk about it at all until after it was all done.”Of course, after it was all done, they filmed a commercial in which they try to one-up each other. The spot, which will start appearing this week, calls to mind a McDonald’s commercial in the 1990s featuring Michael Jordan and Larry Bird engaged in a game of Horse.Asked last month about equipment changes during his tournament last month at Sherwood Country Club, Woods said it could take anywhere from a few weeks to more than a year to become comfortable with new equipment. “It’s worth it in the end if you get it right, and over the course of my career, I haven’t put anything in my bag unless I knew it was already better,” Woods said. “But that’s just because of all the testing I’ve done prior to that.”He added: “Forget what it does on the range, or it’s important what it does on the range, but what is it going to do on the back nine on Sunday? Is this equipment, in general, is this going to help me win golf tournaments?”After winning last year’s P.G.A. Championship by eight shots, McIlroy could be forgiven for feeling as if he could put persimmon woods in his bag and win. Only time will tell whether McIlroy’s gamble rockets him to the next level or fizzles."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/football/michael-hoomanawanui-eager-to-help-the-patriots.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — He said he always wondered. It’s human nature, perhaps, to look at the New England Patriots from the outside as a football voyeur. How do they do it? Will I ever be able to find out for myself?In his first two seasons in the N.F.L., Michael Hoomanawanui played tight end for the anti-Patriots. He was on the St. Louis Rams, playing in just half their games. He was living out the meaning of his last name — “to be patient” — hoping for better things to come. A fifth-round pick from Illinois, he had 20 receptions for 229 yards and 3 touchdowns in two years.Hoomanawanui headed to Hawaii after the 2011 season ended, to his ancestral home, not to the Pro Bowl. The Rams cut him last September — and Hoomanawanui’s world did a quick 180 in the next 48 hours.The Patriots were interested, his agent told him. Then Bill Belichick came on the phone, telling Hoomanawanui that they thought he could help them.Hoomanawanui (pronounced Oh-oh-mah-NAH-wah-NEW-ee) quickly made his way to Foxborough, ready to do whatever he could for the Patriots. He appeared in 14 games during the regular season, missing two with a concussion, then stepped in for the injured Rob Gronkowski on Sunday in the Patriots’ methodical 41-28 dismantling of the overmatched Houston Texans in their A.F.C. divisional playoff game.So far, life in New England has been all that Hoomanawanui had hoped, but dared not to expect.“When you’re on the outside, you’re thinking what everyone else is thinking: why are they always great?” Hoomanawanui said after Sunday’s game. “What are they doing different that they have so much success? Well, when you get here, you quickly find out. It’s the Patriot way. You know, if something isn’t broke, don’t fix it.”Hoomanawanui’s role heading into Sunday’s A.F.C. Championship game against the Baltimore Ravens has taken on added importance with the starter Gronkowski most likely out for the season after re-injuring his left forearm. Hoomanawanui was on the field for 50 of the Patriots’ 66 offensive plays against the Texans. But aside from their weights (two pounds apart) and their position, there is little in common between Hoomanawanui and Gronkowski.Gronkowski was heavily recruited out of high school. Hoomanawanui had one offer, from Illinois, his state university, which was short on tight ends. Gronkowski, who went to Arizona, was N.F.L.-ready by the end of his sophomore year and has been an All-Pro. Hoomanawanui didn’t get to that stage with the Illini until he was a junior, and each year he has fought just to keep to his place on the 53-man roster.“In those first couple years we had him, you would never had thought he’d end up where he did,” said Jim Pry, his position coach at Illinois. “But he kept at it. He worked harder than just about any kid I ever had. And by the time the pro scouts came around to see him, I’d just tell them to watch Michael run a corner route and then remember that he’s 270 pounds.”Against the Texans, Hoomanawanui was used primarily as a blocker. Tom Brady threw 40 passes, none to Hoomanawanui.“Should I see if I can pay him? Nah, he’s got enough money,” Hoomanawanui said of Brady. “Actually, he’s thrown a couple to me.”Brady has thrown five passes to Hoomanawanui this season. There was a career-best 41-yard reception against the 49ers on Dec. 16. He also had a 32-yarder the next week against Jacksonville and an 18-yarder against the Rams. He averages 21.4 yards per catch, even if he doesn’t catch many.Hoomanawanui started five games at tight end, three when Gronkowski was out recovering from a broken left arm and two when Aaron Hernandez was out with an ankle sprain. He also started at running back on Sept. 23 in Baltimore against the Ravens, though only to block.If he is bothered by the lack of attention, it does not show. He knows whence he came, and his current situation is a big improvement from St. Louis.“Whatever they need me to do to be successful, that’s why I’m here,” Hoomanawanui said. “I’m excited. I definitely didn’t have anything like this in my last two years. From Day 1, it’s been very easy to buy into what they do because they’ve been so successful over the years. It’s not an overnight thing.“When you walk into this building,” he added, “everyone is excited to be here. It’s contagious. It starts at the top and trickles all the way down the roster.”All the way down to the role player who hopes to be causing fits for the Ravens on Sunday, not to mention the broadcasters. Hoomanawanui is one victory from the Super Bowl, a position that seemed unimaginable a few short months ago. He no longer has to wonder. He has seen firsthand how it works."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/hockey/islanders-unsure-of-lubomir-visnovskys-return.html,"SYOSSET, N.Y. — Only one N.H.L. player who played overseas during the lockout has refused to return to his team.The reluctant Islanders defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky was asked to report to training camp by Monday morning or face suspension. Instead, he was still in his native Slovakia with his team, Slovan Bratislava of the Kontinental Hockey League. A photograph on Slovan’s Facebook page showed Visnovsky on the team bus, headed to the Czech Republic for Tuesday’s game against Lev Prague. Whether Visnovsky will play in that game was unclear. An agreement between the N.H.L. and the K.H.L. bars players under contract with a team in one league from playing in the other.Bill Daly, the N.H.L. deputy commissioner, said in an e-mail message Monday, “We had further contact with the K.H.L. today, and they continue to assert that Visnovsky will be ineligible to play in K.H.L. games without the Islanders’ consent.”Ilya Kochevrin, the K.H.L.’s head spokesman, said in an e-mail message Monday that the matter “will be decided tomorrow.”The Islanders confirmed Monday that they had neither suspended Visnovsky nor given consent for him to remain with Slovan.Visnovsky told a Slovakian newspaper Monday that he wanted to stay with Slovan because of “family issues,” but he conceded that the Islanders had a right to be upset with him.“I hope they’ll give me some time, and then I’ll see,” Visnovsky said. “Maybe I’ll go there this season.”Visnovsky’s agent, Neil Sheehy, said, “Lubo has personal reasons for not reporting to the Islanders right now, all of which have absolutely nothing to do with the New York Islanders.” He continued, referring to the Islanders’ general manager, “Lubo admires Garth Snow, and we will have to see how this situation plays out.”The Islanders were hoping Visnovsky would play the point on the power play and produce the way he did for Anaheim two seasons ago, when he had 68 points in 81 games. The Islanders are hoping to reach the playoffs for the first time in six seasons.“We had our meetings throughout the summer, and we had him as the first-unit power-play guy,” Coach Jack Capuano said of Visnovsky. “Like I tell my players, there’s controllable circumstances and there’s uncontrollable circumstances, and I can’t control it. He’s not here, and we just have to move on and worry about the guys that we have now.”This is the second time Visnovsky has spurned the Islanders. When he was acquired from Anaheim in June, he refused to report, citing a no-trade clause in his contract. An arbitrator ruled in the Islanders’ favor.Two years ago, another player refused to report the Islanders. In 2010-11, Detroit signed goalie Evgeni Nabokov from SKA St. Petersburg in the K.H.L., but the Islanders claimed him off waivers. Nabokov did not report, and the Islanders suspended him for the rest of the season. He joined the Islanders for the 2011-12 season.“Every situation is different,” Nabokov said. “We don’t know the details, so I can’t really make a judgment. From what I heard, we don’t know everything that’s going on. The young kids will have to make the most of this opportunity.”Nabokov was referring to defenseman Griffin Reinhart, the son of the longtime Calgary defenseman Paul Reinhart and an Islanders first-round draft pick in June. Reinhart and forward Ryan Strome, another first-rounder, make an impressive pair of prospects.But Capuano is not rushing them into the lineup.“We’re talking about elite junior players who have a tremendous jump to make to the National Hockey League level with five days of training camp,” Capuano said. “We’ll see how the week progresses.”In the meantime the Islanders will depend on their few stars when the 48-game season opens Saturday.“It’s going to be an exciting sprint right to the end of April, and we’re looking to be right in it,” said John Tavares, the Islanders’ top center.Tavares scored 42 points in 28 games for SC Bern in Switzerland during the lockout.“We’re not going to worry about anyone who’s not here,” Tavares said. “It’s about the group that’s in this room representing the Islanders and what we want to accomplish.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/tennis/australian-open-lacking-american-men-has-top-two-meeting-early.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Sam Querrey, who at No. 22 is the only seeded American man in the singles draw of the Australian Open, finished his first-round singles match on Monday with an inside-in forehand winner, moving past a Spanish qualifier, Daniel Muñoz-de la Nava, in four sets.In his next match on Wednesday, Querrey will face his friend and countryman Brian Baker, who at No. 57 is the second-highest-ranked American in the draw.Asked if it was unfortunate to be facing another American so early, Querrey said, “Yeah, especially since most of the questions we get are like, ‘There’s five Americans in the draw.’ ” (Five American men were directly entered; three more advanced to the main draw through qualifying.)“It’s tough when two of us are playing each other,” he added. “But it happens, and there’s nothing you can do.”The meeting of the top two Americans in the second round — instead of in the final, as often happened in decades past — is a sign of the times for the American men in Melbourne, where retirements, injuries and illnesses have depleted their ranks.John Isner, who at No. 13 is the top-ranked American, pulled out of the tournament with a lingering knee injury. Mardy Fish, who began 2012 at No. 8, has fallen to No. 29, forced off the tour in recent months by heart-related health issues. Andy Roddick, the last American to win a Grand Slam singles title, at the 2003 United States Open, retired last year. Though Roddick has not played since last year’s United States Open, his ranking, No. 39, still puts him fourth on the American ladder.“I mean, Serena’s probably the real leader,” Querrey said with a laugh when asked if he had emerged as the leader of the American men at this tournament.The United States has won 12 Grand Slam singles titles in the nine years since Roddick’s 2003 triumph: nine by Serena Williams and three by her sister Venus. That ranks second over that time to the 16 that Roger Federer has single-handedly brought to Switzerland.Though there is promise in the current crop of young American women, like Sloane Stephens, 19, and Madison Keys, 17, the focus for the American men has been expectation management.“A little bit, we got spoiled over the years,” John McEnroe said Monday. “Accustomed to great things happening to us, with Connors, Sampras, Agassi, myself. It was a great history, and now we’re struggling.”Of the Americans’ situation in Melbourne this month, McEnroe said: “It’s a little bit unlucky for us right now. John Isner is a guy that’s been in the second week, and he’s hurt, he’s not there. And Mardy Fish, who is currently someone whose illness has kept him out, is certainly someone who has maxed out maybe more than a lot of people including myself thought he was capable of, to eight in the world. Wasn’t able to handle, I guess, all the expectations and the pressure.”The coach and television analyst Brad Gilbert also spoke of the need for reduced expectations for the American men.“It’s like my Raiders,” said Gilbert, a Bay Area native. “We haven’t had a .500 season in 11 years. How about let’s just make the playoffs first?“I think for us, now, it’s like, let’s get some guys in the top 10, let’s get some guys in the top 100. And I think the more guys that we have, I think it will make it easier for maybe that next level that maybe can make a breakthrough when there’s a lot more guys around to win a major.”Like almost all his peers, Querrey does not speak of hastily trying to resurrect American tennis by himself. Though he improved his ranking from to 22 from 93 in 2012, he keeps his stated goals for ascendancy somewhat more conservative.“I want to be a top-10 guy,” he said. “And I want to make the quarterfinal of a Slam.”The exception to that restraint is Ryan Harrison, a 20-year-old ranked 62nd, who spoke Monday about his desire to reach the No. 1 ranking and win a Grand Slam event. Harrison’s results have lagged behind his goals; he has never advanced past the second round of a Grand Slam event, and only just notched his first career win over a top-15 opponent last week in Sydney, against a hobbled Isner.“My goal with my career is to win Grand Slams and to be No. 1,” Harrison said Monday after a four-set win in the first round. “As far as that is away right now, because I have so many steps to get there, and I’m very realistic about understanding that.”He added: “If somebody else is a little more relaxed and wants to surprise themselves all the time, then that might be what they like to do. But that’s not the way I do it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/nyregion/new-york-city-school-bus-drivers-announce-strike.html,"For the first time in more than three decades, New York City’s largest union for school bus drivers plans to strike on Wednesday morning, a move that would affect more than 150,000 students.Even before the head of the union, Local 1811 of the Amalgamated Transit Union, delivered the news at a Midtown Manhattan hotel, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg held his own news conference to denounce the move and say that the city was ready with an array of backup steps to support children and their families.Among them is a plan to provide MetroCards to affected children who take yellow buses, for as long as the strike might last, as well as to the parents of students in kindergarten through second grade.Those whose schools are inaccessible by public transportation can get reimbursed for mileage or cabs, the mayor said. Students will get a two-hour reprieve on lateness or be excused altogether for absences caused by a strike disruption without harm to their attendance rolls, he said.Mr. Bloomberg accused the union of abandoning the students who rely daily on the transportation service.“The union’s decision to strike has nothing to do with safety and everything to do with job protections that the city legally cannot include in its bus contracts,” he said. “We hope that the union will reconsider its irresponsible and misguided decision to jeopardize our students’ education.”The union said the decision for its 8,800 drivers and matrons to strike — the first since a 13-week strike in 1979 — was essentially about children’s safety. It argued that the strike was necessary to preserve job protection for the most experienced yellow-bus drivers when transportation vendors who employ them lose city contracts.Those job-security measures will not be included in the competitive bids that the city is soliciting for 1,100 of its routes, or about a sixth of the total number of routes. The cost of all the city’s routes has mushroomed to $1.1 billion annually from about $100 million a year in 1979.The strike would affect about 111,000 of the 1.1 million public school students, as well as 41,000 parochial school students. The routes in question, for the new contracts, apply to the transportation of 22,500 children from public and parochial schools in kindergarten through 12th grade who have special needs.“It’s a protection that’s in there to provide the best quality driver and matron in the City of New York,” Michael Cordiello, the president of Local 1181, said of the measures.The city maintains that a 2011 state court ruling has legally prohibited it from including the protections in new contracts. But the union disagrees.“There has never been a court ruling that the employee protection provisions are, in all cases, illegal,” said Richard N. Gilberg, a union lawyer.Mr. Cordiello said that the strike was an action “we must take,” and that it would start at 6 a.m. Wednesday. He said the mayor could “come and talk to us and end the strike” at any time, and that there were other ways to resolve the issue, including pulling back the bids.City officials said that, even without the job-security provisions, an array of certifications and qualifications would apply to newly hired bus drivers, including reference letters, criminal history and physical performance checks, and medical examinations."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/sports/football/russell-wilson-seattle-rookie-quarterback-wins-by-losing.html,"For a player, a loss in the postseason is not necessarily a bad thing. There are times when, even in defeat, a player can make his presence known to a wider audience and polish his star.It happened in baseball, with Carlos Beltran earning a nine-figure payday from the Mets largely on the strength of his postseason play with the Houston Astros in 2004. It happened in basketball, where one solid playoff series for Seattle in 2005 made the Knicks overpay for the services of Jerome James.In this season’s N.F.L. playoffs, a breakout performer is someone who has already been sent home: Seahawks quarterback Russell Wilson. Unlike Beltran or James, no one is saying his performance was a fluke.“When the game was over, I was very disappointed,” Wilson told reporters after Seattle’s loss at Atlanta last Sunday. “But walking back into the tunnel, I got so excited about next year. The resilience we showed was unbelievable.”Wilson, a third-round pick who did not become the starter until the third preseason game, knows a lot about resilience. He put on a show against the Falcons, nearly completing the biggest fourth-quarter comeback in N.F.L. playoff history. Along the way he became the seventh quarterback to throw for 300 yards and rush for 50 in a playoff game. Among that group, his 385 passing yards are the highest total. His 428 yards of total offense were the eighth most in postseason history.The sense that he has cemented his status as a star comes less from his statistics, however, than from beating the Redskins in Washington the week before nearly beating the top-seeded Falcons, and their underrated defense. Had Seattle been more aggressive in the first half, Wilson may have been headed to the N.F.C. championship game.Throughout the first half, Seattle tried to establish the run, but Marshawn Lynch was repeatedly stuffed. The attempt to stick with what got the team to the playoffs was admirable, but as Wilson completed passes with ease and ran the ball effectively, the approach led to a seemingly insurmountable deficit. In the second half, when the strategy focused more on Wilson, the Seahawks fought back and were leading until an improbable comeback drive for a field goal by Atlanta in the waning moments.Even with that, the Seahawks may have won if not for a fluke play where Richard Sherman, perhaps the best cornerback in the game, uncharacteristically fell down in coverage, leading to a 47-yard touchdown by Roddy White, more than accounting for the final difference in the score.But in the loss, Wilson, as he did during the season, seemed to get better as the game went on. He sold play-fakes well, hit receivers in space, ran effectively without drawing hard contact and displayed leadership skills not normally seen in rookie quarterbacks.For Wilson, that could have something to do with his time spent as a professional baseball player. Before he was a quarterback mocked for his listed height of 5 feet 10 5/8 inches, he was a 6-foot second baseman in the Colorado Rockies’ system.Other athletes, like Terrell Owens and Tony Gonzalez, wax poetically about the thought of being two-sport athletes, but Wilson may have the chops to pull off such a move. Drafted in the fourth round by the Rockies in 2010 (he had been drafted out of high school by the Orioles as well), he played two parts of seasons of low-level minor league ball before concentrating on football in his final college season at Wisconsin. While he hit.239 in 93 games, he was a solid defensive player, and was named the best athlete and fastest runner in the Rockies’ organization. Baseball America had him ranked as the No. 19 prospect in the team’s system.It is unlikely that a star football player would want to slog through a few minor league seasons in an attempt to make the majors, or that the Seahawks and the Rockies would sign off on the idea. It is not out of the realm of possibility that he could achieve a similar level of two-sport success as Danny Ainge, who was a star for the Boston Celtics and a bit player for the Toronto Blue Jays. Wilson has exceeded expectations, and the two-sport stars Bo Jackson and Brian Jordan may want to keep an eye on him as someone who could join them as All-Star-caliber players in two sports.For now he is focusing on football, and his demeanor after the game may be more exciting for Seahawks fans than his play on the field.“The goal for me is, if I’m here right now, how can I get 10 times better?"" Wilson told reporters Monday. “I think that’s the biggest thing, and it’s the same thing for this football team.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/sports/baseball/nationals-sign-rafael-soriano.html,"The Washington Nationals on Tuesday agreed to terms with relief pitcher Rafael Soriano, strengthening their already formidable bullpen and solidifying their status as legitimate World Series contenders for the 2013 season.The two-year contract, which has not yet been made official, is worth $28 million, with a $14 million vesting option for a third year, according to an executive in baseball with knowledge of the deal.Soriano, a 33-year-old right-hander, will join a bullpen that includes Drew Storen and Tyler Clippard. It was the bullpen, though, that allowed the team’s six-run lead to evaporate in a crushing loss to the St. Louis Cardinals in Game 5 of the National League division series.Soriano’s deal further illustrates the increased competitiveness in the National League East. The Nationals, who won 98 games last season, had already upgraded their starting rotation by adding the right-hander Dan Haren. They also traded for center fielder Denard Span.The Atlanta Braves, who won 94 games, signed outfielder B. J. Upton to a five-year deal. The Philadelphia Phillies, looking to bounce back after an 81-win season, received the 24-year-old outfielder Ben Revere in a trade with the Minnesota Twins.The Soriano move also shines more light on the glaring inactivity of the division’s bottom-dwellers. Far removed from the bustle remain the Miami Marlins, who dismantled a star-studded yet dysfunctional roster, and the Mets, the only team that has not yet signed a major league free agent this off-season.The contrast this week between the Nationals and the Mets was particularly stark. The buzz around the Mets earlier this week involved their reported interest in reliever Brian Wilson, 30, who missed almost all of last season after Tommy John surgery. The Mets’ most significant moves this off-season have been agreeing to a contract extension with the franchise cornerstone David Wright and trading the Cy Young winner R. A. Dickey. They are still in search of a fifth starter and are presumably looking for outfield help.The Nationals should receive a boost from Soriano, who had 42 saves and a 2.26 earned run average for the Yankees last season after stepping into the closer’s role for the injured Mariano Rivera. Soriano opted out of the final season of his three-year contract with the Yankees, which would have paid him $14 million for 2013, instead taking a $1.5 million buyout. The Yankees, who made a qualifying offer to Soriano in November, will receive a 2013 draft pick as compensation."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/sports/football/on-49ers-randy-moss-reinvents-himself-as-role-model.html,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. — About two weeks ago, 49ers staff members affixed placards to the nameplates above each locker at the team’s practice site. The signs are laminated sheets of paper bearing players’ college recruiting information from their days as prep standouts — intended, perhaps, to remind them of where they began, the success they have enjoyed, and maybe even the idea that a sport that may now seem unduly complicated was not always that way.If the legend of Randy Moss had somehow managed to escape the consciousness of any of his teammates, it was cemented on that day.State ranking: 1. National ranking by position: 1. National ranking over all: 1. Rating: Five stars.That information, of course, may as well be from the Stone Age. Moss is nearly 36, old enough that his recruitment photograph is one of only two in the room to appear in black and white. The active leader in receiving yards, the man who has caught more touchdowns than anyone but Jerry Rice, is no longer the best receiver in the N.F.L., or even the receiver atop the depth chart on his own team. That he started in San Francisco’s 45-31 win over the Packers in an N.F.C. divisional playoff game on Saturday was mainly because Mario Manningham blew out his knee on Dec. 23.If Moss has a place within the national consciousness apart from his ability to catch footballs, it has been shaped by a career-long string of controversial behavior, much of which can reasonably be tied to the fact that his talent was sufficient to buy him multiple chances. He squirted an official with a water bottle and mock-mooned the Green Bay crowd while celebrating a touchdown. He shouted down a team sponsor, loudly disparaged a post-practice meal in front of Minneapolis restaurant owners who catered it, and got into an altercation with a Minneapolis traffic cop. He sulked his way out of Minnesota, Oakland and Tennessee.“I play when I want to play,” he once said, inspiring predictable condemnation from the punditocracy.The 2013 version of Randy Moss, however, looks nothing like any of that. The glorified prep rankings that helped carry him through his first 13 seasons are long since irrelevant. No longer able to outrun every cornerback or outleap every safety, Moss has, by necessity, become a sly veteran, using his wiles as much as his physical gifts to extract yardage and the occasional score from limited playing time this season. Although he totaled only 434 yards and three touchdowns in two starts this season, he offered not a negative word about his usage, or Coach Jim Harbaugh’s system, onto the record.It runs far deeper than that, however. It might have been difficult to predict when the 49ers signed Moss in March after he sat out the 2011 season, but he has become an undisputed leader on what may be the N.F.L.’s best team.“A lot has been made about Randy being a certain way, but he’s one of the best teammates I’ve ever had — that any of us has ever had,” said wide receiver Kyle Williams, whose season ended with a knee injury in November. “The emergence of Michael Crabtree isn’t by accident. He’s learned a lot from Randy.”Crabtree, in his fourth season, is putting up the kinds of numbers people expected when he was taken with the 10th overall selection in the 2009 draft: 1,105 yards and 9 touchdowns this season, plus 119 yards and two touchdowns in the victory over the Packers.“Randy is one of the reasons that Crabtree has really developed this year,” safety Donte Whitner said.Moss had four targets against Green Bay, including two deep balls that Colin Kaepernick overthrew. Still, it was all too easy to see a younger iteration of the player who caught a single-season record 23 touchdown passes from Tom Brady in 2007 catching up to the passes somehow, breaking them for long scores as defensive backs spun helplessly into heaps behind him.Instead, Moss has taken to devising other forms of competition. A devotee of pool workouts, he challenges teammates to see who can swim farther underwater. (“He’ll go three lengths — out, back and out again — without coming up for air,” defensive tackle Ricky Jean Francois said. “And I think he can stay down even longer.”) He initiated footraces in training camp. (“He thought he was Usain Bolt out there, and even at his age was beating a lot of guys,” Williams said. “If he’s lost a step, you couldn’t tell.”)“To know that he’s still kicking and ticking like that, there’s still hope for us all,” linebacker Tavares Gooden said.Moss also took to the role of elder statesman, advising not just the team’s receivers, but players from other positions, on both sides of the ball. As running back Brandon Jacobs began a slow simmer through the course of an autumn in which he barely saw the field, Moss advised him to settle down and take personal stock of the situation without making it public; Moss had made similar mistakes earlier in his career, he told him, and had learned from them. Jacobs ignored the advice and sent out negative comments about the team on Instagram. He was subsequently suspended through the end of the regular season, then waived.It appears to be one of the rare times that Moss was ignored.“He’s not the only guy to ever give advice in the locker room, but to be able to have Randy Moss do it is something else,” Williams said. “It’s Randy Moss. Everybody’s going to stop and pay attention because of that. And he’s not wrong, ever.”Whitner said: “It takes a special kind of person to communicate with guys from all walks of life, from different positions on the field. He does it in his own way, in a very real way, and he’s been doing it since day one.”Ultimately, it comes down to the reality that what Moss does for his team on the field no longer holds more importance than what he does off it — perhaps the first time in his career that such a statement has held even a hint of truth. And the placard above his locker serves as the starkest of reminders.“Look at those numbers,” said Jean Francois, who dresses near Moss, staring up in awe at his teammate’s recruitment stats. “It shows where you came from, the beginning, and puts it right above where you are now. Randy’s rankings are incredible, we can all see that, but we can’t turn back the hands of time. If he wants to do better than that — if any of us do — we have to do it right now.”"

Bloomberg’s decision to solicit bids for 1,100 of the city’s 7,700 bus routes. He will not require that the winning companies hire the most experienced unionized drivers — a protection that workers have enjoyed for decades and that the union is demanding be included in the bids.The mayor said that a ruling by New York’s highest court, the Court of Appeals, forbade the city from including the requirements, known as “employee protection provisions.” The union argues that the mayor is misreading the decision.All 8,800 drivers in the union will strike, said Michael Cordiello, the president of the union, Local 1181 of the Amalgamated Transit Union.“We want to provide the safest possible transportation to the kids of the City of New York, and we want to save the jobs of the experienced drivers of New York,” Mr. Cordiello said.The city has put in place measures to help parents manage without buses.The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has issued MetroCards for children who are normally taken by bus to school, and 30-day MetroCards for parents who have to accompany them. The transportation agency will bill the Education Department for the number of rides used.Hiccups are expected. The MetroCards should work on the subways on Wednesday, but may not work on buses immediately because the readers on every bus must be reprogrammed to accept them. The “vast majority” of buses should accept them by Thursday, said Adam Lisberg, a spokesman for the authority. In some situations, the Education Department will reimburse parents for mileage on their cars or for the cost of livery cabs or taxis.Confusion may be compounded because a small fraction of drivers, who are not members of the union, will not be on strike.Sue Pugliese, who has two daughters with autism, said their driver would not be on strike, but because the bus matron, who is a member of Local 1181, would be on strike, the bus could not pick up the children, who take it to Public School 37 on Staten Island. The Education Department has suggested that parents call 311 or look on its Web site for information on which buses would be running.Ms. Pugliese’s daughters take the bus even though they live close to the school. It offers consistency, she said. She will walk her girls to school on Wednesday, though she finds the prospect daunting, because one runs away frequently and the other is prone to tantrums, she said. “Parents are panicked,” she said. “We have enough stress dealing with these children.”The strike will also alter parents’ routines. Ms. Passante, whose son Derek struggled with going to school in the car, said her husband would work from home Wednesday to help out.Michael Walker, a hair stylist in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, said he would probably lose 60 to 90 minutes of his workday, which would cost him $50 to $100, as he would have to leave early to pick up at least one of his three daughters.But Mr. Walker said he supported the strike. “I want the people in charge of getting my kids to school to feel secure,” he said. “They deserve job security.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/sports/tennis/16iht-atp16.html,"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA — Brad Drewett, executive chairman and president of the ATP Tour, announced on Tuesday that he had been diagnosed with A.L.S. — also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease — and would resign from his post after little more than a year in the position.“I hold the ATP very close to my heart, and it’s with sadness that I make the decision to enter this transition period due to my ill health,” Drewett, 54, said in a statement.The news came as a surprise in the tennis community, leaving some in tears in the Australian Open players’ lounge, and also in the meeting room where Drewett announced his decision to members of the ATP board of directors in the morning.“He read a release, and it was very, very emotional,” said Justin Gimelstob, an American former player who is on the board.The search for Drewett’s eventual replacement will now begin.Drewett, an Australian, was a compromise candidate as the leader of the men’s tour. He was offered the post after considerable infighting on the board and disagreement among the game’s leading players, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.But he has deep experience in the game and its administration.He played professionally, reaching the quarterfinals of the 1976 Australian Open, and has served in numerous key positions for the men’s tour. He played a particularly prominent role in promoting and developing the men’s game in Asia as the ATP’s regional director. He was also instrumental in taking the season-ending championship, then known as the Tennis Masters Cup, to Shanghai and served as the tournament director both there and when it moved to London.But the ATP chairmanship was his dream job, and he took the post at a time of increased tension between the players and the leaders of the Grand Slam tournaments over demands for increased prize money.Engaging in face-to-face meetings, he and the players have made progress, securing significant increases in pay from the Australian Open and the United States Open, although Drewett and some players have expressed dissatisfaction with the figures at the United States Open.“We had numerous meetings with him, with the Grand Slams — chatted to him a lot privately as well,” said Andy Murray, the world’s third-ranked player. “It’s obviously very shocking news, very sad. You know, he’s done a very good job for the tour. He’s done a good job of bringing the tournaments together and arranging, you know, the meetings we had with the Slams. He’s definitely had an impact in the time he’s been working there.”Drewett has been constrained by unresolved problems with his vocal chords, which often left his voice a hoarse whisper and forced him to consider surgery to address the problem. But he plans to step aside from his post soon and focus on his health. Gimelstob said Drewett had informed some of the top players, including Federer and Nadal, directly before announcing his decision.“I felt sick when the news came out today,” said Darren Cahill, the Australian coach and analyst who has long been a friend of Drewett’s.“Everyone knows he’s been struggling with the voice for the last year and a half, and he just couldn’t get to the bottom of it,” Cahill said. “So we all, in the back of our minds, were kind of thinking: ‘Is it something more than that?’ But he always said, ‘It’s going to get better, it’s getting better.’“Sometimes the worst things happen to the best people. We don’t know why, but he’s always been a great friend to us and always will be, and our love and support goes to him and his family and his three kids.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/us/politics/texas-secession-movement-unbowed-by-white-house-rejection.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — More than 100,000 people who signed an online petition calling on the Obama administration to allow Texas to secede from the United States and create an independent government received an official 476-word response from the White House last week.The short answer was no.But the response — in which a White House official said the founding fathers established the United States as a “perpetual union” — hardly discouraged the Texas secession movement, which has been simmering for decades but gained momentum after the re-election of President Obama.On the opening day of the Legislature here last Tuesday, supporters of the Texas Nationalist Movement — a group that wants Texas to sever its federal ties and become an independent nation — met with Republican leaders, including Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. It was another sign that ideas once regarded as radical and even unpatriotic have found a measure of support, or at least sympathy, among some conservatives.The movement also scored a mention in one legislator’s opening-day speech, though it was not a reference that pleased supporters of the cause. “Our economy is so vast and diverse that if Texas were its own country — and no, don’t worry, that isn’t something we’re going to do this session — but if we were, we’d be the 14th-largest economy in the world,” the speaker of the House, Joe Straus III, a San Antonio Republican, told lawmakers.Obama administration officials were reacting to a flurry of secession petitions filed by residents of Texas and other states on a section of the White House Web site. The Texas petition, with 125,746 signatures, declared that withdrawing from the Union was “practically feasible” since the state had a balanced budget.The director of the White House Office of Public Engagement, Jon Carson, wrote in his response that free and open debate was good for democracy, but also cited some of the legal arguments against secession, including Texas v. White, an 1869 Supreme Court ruling that found that individual states did not have a right to secede.“Our founding fathers established the Constitution of the United States ‘in order to form a more perfect union’ through the hard and frustrating but necessary work of self-government,” Mr. Carson wrote. “They enshrined in that document the right to change our national government through the power of the ballot — a right that generations of Americans have fought to secure for all. But they did not provide a right to walk away from it.”Mr. Carson was answering secession petitions filed by residents of Texas, Louisiana, Alabama and five other states, as well as one counterpetition seeking the deportation of everyone who signed a secession petition.The communications director for the Texas Nationalist Movement, Jeff Sadighi, shrugged off the White House response and pointed to a section of the State Constitution that says Texans have the right “to alter, reform or abolish their government in such manner as they may think expedient.”At the opening of the legislative session, the group rallied on the steps of the Capitol and went to the offices of lawmakers seeking support for a referendum asking Texas voters to accept or reject secession. They got a warm reception: the group’s president, Daniel Miller, met with Mr. Dewhurst for about an hour.“We had a lengthy discussion about the U.S. Constitution, the Texas Constitution and the future of Texas,” Mr. Miller said. “He was cordial and engaging on the issues with which we are concerned.”A spokesman for the lieutenant governor, Matt Hirsch, said that Mr. Miller was one of several constituents who met with Mr. Dewhurst on the first day of the session, but that as a proud veteran Mr. Dewhurst believed in preserving and protecting the Union."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/sports/hockey/los-angeles-kings-look-to-defend-their-title.html,"EL SEGUNDO, Calif. — On the second day of the N.H.L.’s truncated training camps, six news vans and satellite trucks parked in the lot of the training center shared by the Los Angeles Kings and the Los Angeles Lakers.The defending Stanley Cup champion Kings finished their Monday morning practice outside the glare of the television cameras. Their injured center Anze Kopitar, who produced 20 points in 20 playoff games, tested his sprained right knee for the first time during a 30-minute skate in front of two team employees and a handful of print and online journalists clicking away on their smartphone cameras.The television cameras flocked to the practice court of the Lakers, whose injured center, Dwight Howard, had returned to the lineup the night before and produced 22 points in 29 minutes for the last N.B.A. team to record its first victory of the new calendar year.Welcome to Los Angeles, where dysfunction rules even as the Kings, after a seven-month hiatus, finally are able to begin their reign. Their campaign to become the first team since Detroit in 1998 to win back-to-back Stanley Cup championships starts Saturday with a home game against the Chicago Blackhawks. Before the puck drops, the players will receive their championship rings and the fans will get replicas of the title banner that will be raised to the rafters during a ceremony that had to wait for three months because of the lockout.The Kings were one of the feel-good stories of 2012, but that was then. The new season, said the team’s president and general manager, Dean Lombardi, “is not about recapturing that feeling, it’s about writing a new story.”The roster that compiled a 16-4 record in the postseason returns intact, no small advantage in a lockout-shortened 48-game season. The Kings on Sunday added forward Anthony Stewart, a former first-round draft pick of the Florida Panthers whom they acquired in a trade that sent Kevin Westgarth, who was not on their playoff roster, to the Carolina Hurricanes.“It’s an advantage if we’re healthy, but unfortunately, we’re not,” said Kings Coach Darryl Sutter, who begins his first full season, such as it is, at the helm of the team after replacing Terry Murray, who was fired last December.He added, “When we won the championship last year, if you look at the lineup we fielded from the middle of January on, it was pretty much intact.”In addition to Kopitar, who was injured while playing in Sweden during the lockout, the veteran defenseman Willie Mitchell has been kept off the ice while rehabilitating from off-season knee surgery.One player Sutter is not worried about is his star goaltender, Jonathan Quick, who had back surgery in August. Quick’s physician, Dr. Robert Watkins, also operated on the Howard in April.Quick was bothered all spring by a herniated disk that pinched his sciatic nerve. Playing through the discomfort, Quick posted a 1.41 goals-against average and .946 save percentage in the postseason on his way to earning the Conn Smythe Trophy.If the season had started on time, Quick would not have been cleared to play. The condensed schedule, with its average of 3.44 games a week, sets up well for Quick and the Kings, who dominated the postseason after squeaking into the playoffs in the eighth and final spot. On the way to becoming the first eighth seed in the N.H.L. to win the Stanley Cup, they went unbeaten on the road and dispatched the first, second and third seeds.“The tempo, the speed, the urgency of every game, it’s going to feel like the playoffs all over again,” Quick said.Quick, who turns 27 two days after the season opener, was one of 10 Connecticut-born players in the N.H.L. last season. There have been only 28 in the league’s history, and he was proud to parade the Stanley Cup in front of nearly 200 of his friends and neighbors during an August weekend-long celebration in his hometown, Hamden.The mood was much more somber when he returned in December, for a weekend visit, during a break in his training with the Kings’ minor league team in Manchester, N.H. Accompanied by his pregnant wife, Jaclyn, and their toddler daughter, Madison, Quick started on the three-and-half-hour drive.On the radio, they heard a news bulletin about a shooting at an elementary school in Newtown, Conn., about 30 miles west of Hamden. Over the next couple of hours, they learned more about the massacre of 20 first graders and 6 school staff members at Sandy Hook Elementary.“As you get closer and closer to Connecticut and driving through Connecticut, every radio station’s covering it,” Quick said. “My daughter’s sleeping in the back, and I look over and my wife, who’s due in April, is crying. I just had to turn the radio off.”Quick said he will hold Newtown in his heart this season.“There’s no words you can say that mean anything, you know?” Quick said. “At the end of the day, no matter what you do or say, it’s not going to give any justice to what took place.”Later on Monday, Quick and his teammates traveled across town to Staples Center for a practice attended by more than 6,000 fans and televised on a sports cable network. The 119-day lockout was but a blink for a franchise that waited 45 years to celebrate its first Stanley Cup.It matters little to the Kings that they are entering uncharted territory, or that they have had to wait so long to raise their championship banner. Their theme for this season is “The Journey Continues.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/tennis/easy-wins-for-djokovic-and-sharapova-but-stosur-loses.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Novak Djokovic was all but perfect in his second-round match Wednesday against Ryan Harrison, beating the 20-year-old American, 6-1, 6-2, 6-3, to stay on track for his third consecutive Australian Open title and the fourth of his career.Maria Sharapova was even more convincing a few hours earlier, winning by 6-0, 6-0 for the second time in two matches to set up a third-round encounter with Venus Williams.Williams beat Alize Cornet, 6-3, 6-3, in the match preceding the Djokovic-Harrison encounter at Rod Laver Arena, which will be the likely venue for her big matchup Friday against Sharapova.Reigning French Open champion Sharapova holds a 4-3 edge in career meetings, but Williams has won both of their meetings at Grand Slam tournaments — at Wimbledon in 2005 and 2007.Venus’s sister Serena, playing in the other half of the draw, had the day off Wednesday and was able to rest the right ankle she injured in her first-round match. She is set to play Garbine Muguruza on Thursday as she pursues her third Grand Slam title in a row.Djokovic, a loser in the United States Open final last year to Andy Murray, looks as if he wants to atone for that defeat. He was relentless in beating the overmatched Harrison, winning the first set in only 20 minutes and the match in one and a half hours while making just 16 unforced errors.“I tried to focus from the start,” Djokovic said. “Obviously, I knew he had nothing to lose, he’s going to come out and hit big serves. Pity for him, I don’t think he played his best.”Sharapova did. The second-seeded Russian beat Japan’s Misaki Doi by the double-bagel score in just 47 minutes, her second consecutive match at Melbourne Park in which her opponent failed to win a game. Doi won only 15 points.Sharapova, last year’s Australian Open runner-up, pulled out of the Brisbane International with a right collarbone injury two weeks ago and had not played a competitive match this year until her 6-0, 6-0 win over her fellow Russian Olga Puchkova in the first round Monday.She is the first woman to post consecutive 6-0, 6-0 scorelines at a Grand Slam since Wendy Turnbull at the Australian Open in 1985.“I’ve been playing really aggressive and doing the right things,” Sharapova said. “It’s not easy to be up so much because you can have a few letdowns. You just have to try to concentrate. My job is to make it as easy as possible.”The final match of Wednesday’s session on the center court was disappointing, though not wholly unexpected, for the home crowd and Australia’s top-ranked female player, Samantha Stosur.The ninth-seeded Stosur, who has spoken of her anxiety over playing in front of her home fans, served twice for the match but double-faulted on match point in a 6-4, 1-6, 7-5 loss to Zheng Jie of China.“It was a bit of a choke,” Stosur said. “Obviously it’s a hard one to take when you get yourself into a winning position and you lose five games straight.”Stosur, who had 9 double faults and 56 unforced errors, has never gone beyond the fourth round at her home Grand Slam, lost in the first round last year and also lost in her first matches at warm-up tournaments this year in Brisbane and Sydney.“I needed to keep fighting and enjoy the match,” Zheng said. “It’s amazing I came back.”Earlier, fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska extended the year’s best winning streak to 11 matches. She eased into the third round with a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Irina-Camelia Begu of Romania and remains unbeaten this year, including titles at warm-up tournaments this month at Auckland and Sydney.“I can play even better,” said Radwanska, who lost last year’s Wimbledon final to Serena Williams. “I didn’t really expect I could win that many matches in a row, and hopefully I can keep going.”Her last two trips to the Australian Open have ended in quarterfinal losses to the eventual champion — Kim Clijsters in 2011 and Victoria Azarenka last year.With top-ranked Azarenka and Serena Williams on the other half of the draw, Radwanska’s main obstacles to reaching the final are the 2011 French Open champion Li Na, who beat Olga Goortsova of Belarus, 6-2, 7-5, to reach the third round, and potential semifinal rivals Sharapova or No. 5 Angelique Kerber, who advanced with a 6-3, 6-1 win over Lucie Hradecka.Serena Williams, who has lost only one match since her first-round exit at the French Open last year, canceled an outdoor practice session and moved it indoors to test out her sore ankle.In other women’s second-round matches: No. 11 Marion Bartoli beat Serbian qualifier Vesna Dolonc, 7-5, 6-0; No. 13 Ana Ivanovic had a 7-5, 1-6, 6-4 win over the Taiwanese qualifier Chan Yung-Jan; No. 18 Julia Gorges beat Romina Oprandi, 6-3, 6-2; No. 22 Jelena Jankovic, a former world No. 1, beat the qualifier Maria Joao Koehler, 2-6, 7-6 (5), 6-2; and the 17-year-old American wild-card Madison Keys beat No. 30 Tamira Paszek of Austria, 6-2, 6-1.The qualifier Valeria Savinykh of Russia upset No. 15 Dominika Cibulkova, 7-6 (6), 6-4, and Kirsten Flipkens of Belgium beat No. 23 Klara Zakopalova, 6-1, 6-0.On the men’s side, No. 4-ranked David Ferrer needed five match points before clinching a 6-0, 7-5, 4-6, 6-3 win overTim Smyczek of the United States, who got into the main draw as a lucky loser from qualifying.Fifth-seeded Tomas Berdych beat Guillaume Rufin of France, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4, and eighth-seeded Janko Tipsarevic beat Lukas Lacko, 6-3, 6-4, 3-6, 4-6, 7-5, in a match that lasted nearly four hours.No. 10 Nicolas Almagro and No. 16-ranked Kei Nishikori also moved on while No. 24 Jerzy Janowicz of Poland rallied from two sets down to overpower Somdev Devvarman of India, 6-7 (10), 3-6, 6-1, 6-0, 7-5.Also advancing were No. 22 Fernando Verdasco; No. 28 Marcos Baghdatis, the 2006 Australian Open runner-up; No. 31 Radek Stepanek and No. 32 Julien Benneteau. Stepanek beat Feliciano Lopez, 6-2, 6-2, 6-4, and will next play Djokovic."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/football/paul-kruger-leads-ravens-defense-to-afc-championship-game.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — When Terrell Suggs tore his right Achilles’ tendon over the off-season, his Baltimore Ravens teammates were concerned, and that might be putting it mildly. How would the defense’s pass rush hold up? Suggs seemed almost irreplaceable.“Guys were worried,” defensive end Arthur Jones said.In stepped Paul Kruger, a fourth-year linebacker whose understated résumé featured six and a half career sacks and one start. If this did not foster much optimism within the locker room, his play soon did.Kruger has been a force for the Ravens heading into Sunday’s A.F.C. championship game against the New England Patriots, moving seamlessly from roles at defensive end and linebacker to, he said, “kind of just doing everything.”Within the patchwork quilt that has been the Ravens’ season, Kruger has been as rugged as a burlap sack. He had seven and a half sacks over the final eight games of the regular season, and nine total. He made a game-changing play in Saturday’s divisional playoff victory over the Denver Broncos. And he has showcased such expert pass-rushing technique that his own teammates are studying film of him.“He has this little thing that I call the Puppet Leg,” Jones said. “I can’t do it.”Kruger traveled a long road to reach this point.“For me, it was just a process of figuring out where it’s all going to fit together,” he said Wednesday at the Ravens’ training facility.Kruger, 26, is still a relative newcomer to the position. He played quarterback in high school, served a two-year Mormon mission and then switched to tight end after he enrolled at Utah. But several weeks into that experiment, Utah Coach Kyle Whittingham realized that Kruger had immense upside as a defensive end.“Just so athletic, and that’s his major attribute,” Whittingham said in a telephone interview.Kruger spent two seasons at Utah before declaring for the N.F.L. draft, but he said his time in college changed him, for reasons that are readily apparent. He has twin eight-inch scars that intersect near his navel. “Never in a million years did I think I’d be stabbed,” he said.In January 2008, shortly after his freshman season, Kruger was on his way home from a party with several friends when they were attacked by a gang in a Salt Lake City neighborhood. Kruger’s assailants stabbed him in the ribs and abdomen. His younger brother, David, was struck in the face with brass knuckles. A teammate, Greg Newman, was stabbed with a screwdriver. Both survived.Kruger had four hours of surgery. After two months, he could twist his torso. After three months, he could run. That fall, he started 13 games at defensive end and led Utah with 7.5 sacks and 16.5 tackles for loss.“He dominated,” said Ravens receiver David Reed, who played at Utah with Kruger. “Just a beast.”Kruger said he used to be the type of guy who would get into fights, describing himself as “reckless.” As cliché as it sounds, he said, he got his priorities straight after the episode in Salt Lake City. “It was probably a good thing,” he said.With the Ravens, Kruger is more of a muted presence, at least off the field. With Suggs back in the fold after missing the first six games of the season, the tandem has created problems for offensive lines.In the Ravens’ wild-card victory over Indianapolis, Kruger spent nearly as much time in the Colts’ backfield as did Andrew Luck. Kruger had two and a half sacks — the second-most in a playoff game in the Ravens’ history — made four tackles, deflected a pass and caused a fumble.Kruger’s experience in the Ravens’ trip to Denver was not as smooth. He said he was coping with the lung-searing effects of altitude well before halftime, and Peyton Manning always seemed a fingertip beyond reach. But Kruger did have some success flushing Manning from the pocket and forced him to throw an errant pass early in the third quarter.Yet Kruger’s most important play did not come until overtime, on what turned out to be Denver’s final snap from scrimmage. On second-and-6 from the Denver 38, Kruger lined up wide. Operating against the Broncos’ Orlando Franklin, a 6-foot-7, 330-pound offensive tackle whose dimensions evoke a midsize automobile, Kruger drove his hands forward and got Franklin on his heels.“He’s a big man,” Kruger said.Sensing pressure, Manning scrambled to his right and threw an ill-advised pass that lacked zip. The result was an interception by cornerback Corey Graham, which set the stage for Justin Tucker’s game-winning, 47-yard field goal.Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, in typical staccato fashion, rattled through Kruger’s attributes Wednesday: “He’s got good quickness. He plays strong. He’s long. He’s got good length to be able to be disruptive. He does a good job in pass coverage. Smart player. Pretty instinctive.”The list went on and on, and it started to feel official: Kruger had become a factor."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/football/bears-hire-marc-trestman-of-the-cfl-as-their-new-coach.html,"Marc Trestman was smart enough for Bernie Kosar, Steve Young and Rich Gannon. He was valued enough by the nine N.F.L. teams that hired him as an assistant over nearly two decades. Trestman was seasoned enough, finally, as a head coach, to compile a 64-34 record and consecutive Grey Cup championships in five seasons with the Montreal Alouettes of the C.F.L.And Warren Moon, a member of the Pro Football Hall of Fame, will gladly tell those fans unfamiliar with the C.F.L. or Trestman, that he will, indeed, be a success as the new Chicago Bears coach.“He’s been very successful in the N.F.L.,” Moon, a quarterback who won five Grey Cups in six C.F.L. seasons, said Wednesday in a telephone interview. “He’s a coach, and a coach is a coach. As long as he knows football and he knows how to teach and he knows how to communicate with his players, it doesn’t matter if he’s coming from high school or college. If you can coach, you can coach. And I think Marc Trestman can coach.”Gannon was the N.F.L.’s most valuable player in 2002 with the Oakland Raiders, with Trestman as his quarterbacks coach. While Coach Jon Gruden was more “volatile,” Gannon said, Trestman was “more cerebral and even-keeled,” “a calming, diffusive presence.”“He’s innovative, a terrific communicator; he’s the ears and the eyes of the quarterback,” Gannon said in a telephone interview. “The way he saw the game. The way he could explain it. He was very honest, always great with feedback, didn’t have a huge ego.”Trestman, 57, who has not coached in the N.F.L. for eight years, is a quiet, smart quarterback guru. He is taking the path of the Hall of Fame coaches Marv Levy and Bud Grant. Grant won four Grey Cups in 10 seasons and then built his reputation with the Minnesota Vikings, guiding them to four Super Bowls, though all were losses. (Grant was the first N.F.L. coach to hire Trestman, in 1985).Levy coached the Alouettes to two Grey Cups in five seasons in the mid-1970s. After spending four seasons as an N.F.L. special-teams coach, when the job was mostly new, he had wanted to be a head coach, but there was no interest. After Levy won his second Grey Cup, three N.F.L. teams offered him a job as head coach. He chose the Kansas City Chiefs and eventually went on to coach the Buffalo Bills, leading them to four consecutive Super Bowls (all losses).Levy had known Trestman only for his reputation around the league when Trestman invited him to an Alouettes preseason camp to offer ideas.Levy had no advice on etiquette to give Trestman, who has a law degree from the University of Miami. Trestman communicated with his players, his assistants and his general managers like a head coach, Levy said. Trestman organized his practices like a head coach. He doled out discipline like a head coach. He even looked the part.“The same darn things win if you run, throw, block, tackle, catch, kick better than your opponent and integrate your system well,” Levy said Wednesday in a telephone interview.“He may just be the right guy for Jay Cutler,” Levy said. “I think Marc is going to get through to the guy and get the best out of him.”Trestman’s background with quarterbacks — he was Kosar’s quarterbacks coach at Miami and with the Cleveland Browns, and Young’s quarterbacks coach at San Francisco — undoubtedly appealed to the Bears, who have withstood Cutler’s injuries, interceptions and inconsistency for four seasons.The two have a history together. Trestman tutored Cutler and his backup, Jason Campbell, before they were drafted, as he did with Tim Tebow.The C.F.L. may not be the N.F.L., but it is still football, Moon asserted.The rules, though, are glaringly different. The C.F.L.’s field is longer (110 yards to the N.F.L.’s 100) and wider (65 yards to the N.F.L.’s 531/3). There are 12 players per side, and there are only three downs, not four. The field is open there, and the offenses are spread, perfect for quarterbacks, and surely for Trestman.Until the Bears called, it must have seemed like a dream."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/football/the-eagles-hire-oregons-chip-kelly.html,"On Saturday evening, the Philadelphia Eagles sent out a curious statement. They explained that they had no regrets about how much time they had spent interviewing the best college coaches for their vacant head coaching spot, despite knowing there was only a remote chance one of them would leave for the N.F.L. The statement was an indication the Eagles were moving on, having failed to land their top choice.On Wednesday, in a stunning reversal, Oregon Coach Chip Kelly, the object of the Eagles’ ardor since Andy Reid was fired after a 4-12 season, became the team’s new coach. Kelly had initially passed on the Eagles, with whom he met for nine hours after the Fiesta Bowl on Jan. 3, and other interested teams, including the Cleveland Browns.Kelly indicated early in the process that an N.C.A.A. investigation into Oregon’s recruiting practices would not influence his decision about jumping to the N.F.L. At some point in the last three days, Kelly apparently changed his mind about leaving, although it was unclear why. It happened so quickly that Oregon recruits, with national signing day on Feb. 6, were shocked.“Chip Kelly left?!” Nico Faleh, an Oregon recruit, wrote on Twitter. “He was at my house 2 days ago.”Kelly, 49, has no pro football experience as a player or assistant coach. But the high-speed, aggressive style of play he honed at Oregon — it is called the blur offense — has been intriguing to a league that has tilted so heavily to offense that all six head coaching hires this off-season have been offensive coaches.Kelly has, in recent years, met with the New England Patriots, the Seattle Seahawks, the Miami Dolphins, the Buffalo Bills and the San Francisco 49ers to compare notes on offensive strategy, and the Patriots have adopted elements of the hurry-up game used by his Ducks. Oregon, which even practices fast, averaged 49.6 points a game last season.“Chip Kelly will be an outstanding head coach for the Eagles,” the team’s owner, Jeffrey Lurie, said in a statement. “He has a brilliant football mind. He motivates his team with his actions as well as his words. He will be a great leader for us and will bring a fresh, energetic approach to our team.”After he hires his staff — the defensive coordinator spot will be especially important because Kelly was known to have very little input in that area at Oregon — the most critical decision Kelly will make in Philadelphia will be at quarterback.The Eagles had appeared ready to part with Michael Vick, who is due $15.5 million next season but can be cut before the Super Bowl with no financial obligation. Kelly, though, may want to keep both Vick — presumably after a pay cut — and Nick Foles, to explore which of them best fits in his fast-paced spread offense. Vick has the necessary mobility, but he has never run an offense like Kelly’s, and Kelly may prefer to start with a younger quarterback with a lower salary.One person with particular insight into Kelly’s offense is the Baltimore Ravens’ Dennis Dixon, who was Oregon’s quarterback when Kelly was the offensive coordinator. Dixon said he was shocked by Kelly’s decision but intrigued by how his system would translate.“I’m really curious seeing how that fast-paced offense at Oregon is excelling in the N.F.L. as well,” Dixon said. “The Tom Bradys and the Peyton Mannings, when they go to that no-huddle, they keep the defense off-pace. Just to have that actual zone-read option with Michael Vick possibly, I can really see that happening.”He added: “Chip Kelly is a smart man. He’s a guru when it comes to offense. I think he can exploit as far as the Eagles and excel in that aspect. Like I said, I can envision Michael Vick doing exactly what the Oregon organization is doing now.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/football/49ers-justin-smith-shakes-off-focus-on-injured-arm.html,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. — So there was Justin Smith, inside a tent on Wednesday, behind a lectern, clad in gray San Francisco 49ers sweats complete with the requisite lineman stains. His face hinted at neither worry nor concern. That whole thing about a partly torn triceps tendon?What whole thing about a partly torn triceps tendon?Smith, an All-Pro defensive lineman, took several questions about the injury, which in December ended his streak of consecutive starts dating to 2001. He spoke of his “love-hate” relationship with the bulky black brace he wore on his left arm last weekend against the Green Bay Packers. He even noted the obvious possibility that he could exacerbate the injury and further tear the tendon, which he dismissed with a quick “I’m not concerned.”He added, “I really don’t want to get into how it feels, or this or that.”Smith’s injury, however he wanted to deal with or describe it, loomed anyway over San Francisco’s preparation for the N.F.C. championship game Sunday in Atlanta against the Falcons. That is because Smith is more than simply important to the 49ers’ defense; he is emblematic of both the team and its hard-hat mentality, which made San Francisco a trendy Super Bowl favorite pick this week.In the 49ers’ 45-31 demolition of the Packers, another trendy Super Bowl favorite before last weekend, Smith played all but five defensive snaps. According to statistics compiled during the coaches’ film review, Smith recorded four solo tackles, four assisted tackles, two quarterback hits and four quarterback pressures. The official game statistics credited him with five tackles.Regardless, Coach Jim Harbaugh acknowledged Smith’s impact.“And the legend grows,” Harbaugh told reporters. “What a player.”Spend enough time at the 49ers’ practice facility, listen to enough teammates, and Smith sounds like some combination of Reggie White and Chuck Norris. Able to command double teams and topple two men with one hand. Strong enough to slam a revolving door. Part man, part anchor, part beast.He signed with the 49ers in 2008, after seven seasons in Cincinnati. Mike Nolan, the San Francisco coach back then, told the retired quarterback Trent Dilfer that Smith should be ranked among the top five players in professional football. To Dilfer, that seemed to be an exaggeration. Until he started to watch Smith — really watch him.“So much of Justin’s greatness doesn’t show up in making plays,” Dilfer said in a telephone interview. “So much of it is in how he helps others to make plays. I’m convinced he’s one of the top 10 best players in the N.F.L., the impact he has on every game.”To add to Dilfer’s point, Smith’s accolades occupied a full page in San Francisco’s game notes this week. Among the highlights: Smith made the past four Pro Bowls, recorded at least six sacks in each of those seasons (tied for the second-longest such streak in team history) and led all defensive linemen with 792 tackles since 2001 (according to official game book statistics). This season, despite the injury, Smith was voted All-Pro again, to the second team.Smith tore the triceps tendon against New England in mid-December, and his absence forced the 49ers to reconfigure some of their base defense. Where Smith occupied multiple blockers on many plays, those extra linemen or backs could shift elsewhere, worried about linebackers or others on the 49ers’ line. Sometimes that meant San Francisco was forced to rush more players, which left fewer in coverage. This was the trickle-down effect.So continued a postseason defined in part by the walking wounded. There went Robert Griffin III, limping through a first-round loss to the Seattle Seahawks, and Ray Lewis, with a brace similar to Smith’s protecting his own arm against the Denver Broncos.The Sacramento Bee tracked down the manufacturer of the brace, a company called DonJoy, which said that it made this brace with hollow carbon fiber and that it weighed 16 ounces. Lewis also wore a DonJoy, as did J. J. Watt of the Houston Texans, according to The Bee. The Brace Brigade, if you will.Smith eased back into practice as his injury healed, despite the surgery that he said he would have this off-season. He missed parts of three games, including two starts, but was aided by the bye San Francisco received. Last week, as the Packers game neared, Smith worked on a limited basis while Harbaugh gave reporters an all-timer in regard to Smith’s injury status.“God willing and the creek don’t rise, he’s going to play,” Harbaugh said.And play Smith did, as the 49ers marched into the N.F.C. title game for the second straight season. The vibe around the facility felt different this week, Smith said. Just getting to that point no longer felt like an accomplishment. The goal is beyond the conference championship, but closer now.“There’s a different feel this year,” Smith said, his torn triceps notwithstanding, hardly acknowledged, yet also pivotal for the 49ers’ playoff hopes."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/soccer/cosmos-unveil-plan-for-soccer-stadium-near-belmont-park.html,"The New York Cosmos, whose forebears ignited a soccer boom four decades ago, said Wednesday that they hoped to build a stadium near Belmont Park Race Track in Nassau County, just over the border with New York City. The stadium would be part of a new shopping and entertainment district.The $400 million privately financed project, which was lauded by local politicians eager to attract jobs and tax revenue, would include a 25,000-seat soccer stadium (that could be expanded), 9 restaurants, shops, a 175-room hotel and a 4.3-acre park. The stadium would be designed by Populous, which worked on the new Yankee Stadium, Citi Field and other projects.The proposal was submitted last week to the Empire State Development Corporation, which is expected to take several months to pick a winning bid. If the Cosmos, who will play in the fall in the second-division North American Soccer League, are chosen, they could end up competing with Major League Soccer, which has been pushing for the construction of a similarly sized stadium in Flushing Meadows-Corona Park just 10 miles away. The proposed stadium in Flushing would create a stadium hub near Citi Field and the Billie Jean King Tennis Center, and have easy access to the subway, commuter rail lines and parking lots. But some local residents have opposed the stadium because it would sit on some of the most heavily used city park land.A stadium near Belmont Park would be on lightly used state land that abuts the Cross Island Parkway. But the Long Island Rail Road spur that leads to the racetrack runs infrequently, and subway stations are much farther away.M.L.S. has been trying to sell the rights to a 20th team that would be located in New York City to create a rivalry with the Red Bulls, who play in Harrison, N.J., near Newark, and draw soccer fans from around the city and its suburbs. The Cosmos, who played two seasons on Long Island in the early 1970s and folded in the mid-1980s, have long been viewed as a natural fit.M.L.S., though, is still seeking a buyer willing to pay the substantial franchise fee to enter the league. The Cosmos took a different tack last July when they joined the N.A.S.L., a minor league. The Cosmos will begin play in August at Hofstra University.Seamus O’Brien, the chairman of NY Cosmos LLC, which includes investors from Saudi Arabia, has spoken with Don Garber, the commissioner of the M.L.S. But the men have not spoken since July, when the Cosmos joined the rival league. O’Brien has said the Cosmos want to play soccer at the highest level, wherever that may be, but first the team must be re-established in New York.“You want to get your bases right before you crank it up and move on,” O’Brien said. “We have to get a few things straight. The worst thing would be to fall on our faces.”O’Brien said the N.A.S.L. was a good fit for the Cosmos because teams are allowed to own and sell their players, and control their own licensing, which can be lucrative in the case of the Cosmos.While it is possible that the bid to build a stadium near Belmont Park could be used as leverage to get M.L.S. to lower the franchise fee, which Garber has said will be $100 million, it makes more sense to build a stadium as part of a real-estate development rather than just a stadium. The question, though, is whether Belmont Park is the right place for that kind of project.“Having a venue around where the 18- to 34-year-old men are located is a traditional model around the world,” said Jeff L’Hote, a soccer consultant. “I wonder if it’s an attractive location.”For its part, “Major League Soccer continues to work with the City of New York and local elected officials on our quest to build a soccer stadium in Queens and are making progress with the project,” said Dan Courtemanche, a spokesman for the league. “We are in discussions with a variety of potential ownership groups, all who are very interested in being involved with the Division I soccer league in North America.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/hockey/back-from-russia-devils-kovalchuk-hits-the-ground-skating.html,"NEWARK — The Devils welcomed back their leading scorer, right wing Ilya Kovalchuk, on Wednesday while securing another of their top threats by signing center Travis Zajac to an eight-year contract worth $46 million.Kovalchuk, who played for St. Petersburg during the N.H.L. lockout and remained in Russia once the stoppage ended to play in the Kontinental Hockey League’s All-Star Game on Sunday, dismissed reports that he had considered remaining in his homeland.“I don’t know where you read these comments, but I have a contract here,” Kovalchuk said. “They have a rule that you have to go back.”Russia’s Sport-Express had quoted him as saying he was “not in a hurry to get to America” and would need to read the new collective bargaining agreement before making plans. While emphasizing that he always intended to honor a 15-year, $100-million contract with the Devils that has 13 years and more than $83 million left, he succeeded in turning the four-month lockout into an enjoyable period in his life. “I played in my home country, in front of my family and friends,” he said. “Why not? It was a good time.”Kovalchuk, 29, arrived late Tuesday afternoon in time to participate in a scrimmage against Albany, the organization’s top minor league affiliate, on Wednesday. He missed the first three practices. “For a guy who got off the plane — I don’t know how long his travel was — he looked pretty good,” Coach Peter DeBoer said.The early absence of Kovalchuk, who produced one goal and assisted on Zajac’s score during the scrimmage, did not appear to disrupt the locker room. “At their all-star game, like our all-star game, they expect guys to be there,” goaltender Martin Brodeur said. “He was caught up in being maybe the face of the game.”Kovalchuk is confident his body will adjust to the time difference by Saturday, when the Devils open their 48-game schedule by playing at the Islanders. He led the team with 37 goals and 83 points last season. He will be relied on more than ever with the free-agent departure of Zach Parise, who had served as team captain and been a dependable scorer with 31 goals and 69 points. “Everybody has to do their job,” Kovalchuk said. “It is a big loss for us, but we still have good players on the team.”There is no doubt, though, that his teammates will look to him to again be a prolific scorer while positioning others for point-blank opportunities with his deft passes. “He’s a big part of this team and he wants to win more than anything,” Zajac said. “We can use his skill set more than ever.”The same can be said for Zajac. Although an Achilles’ injury limited him to 15 games in the regular season, he returned to health to play an integral role in the playoffs last season. He scored seven goals with seven assists in helping the Devils make a startling advance to the Stanley Cup finals after they finished sixth in the Eastern Conference.“He’s developed himself into an all-situation complete player,” General Manager Lou Lamoriello said. “He’s one of our core leaders. He has been from Day 1. His play in the playoffs was monumental for us. With him coming back in the lineup, it was quite evident what he means.”The team was searching for an encouraging word. The loss of Parise to the Minnesota Wild was followed by Lamoriello’s announcement at the start of training camp that he would not attempt to retain Petr Sykora, a source of offense for many years, to give young players an opportunity.“It’s great news,” DeBoer said of the extension given to Zajac. “He’s such a prototypical New Jersey Devil. He’s a big, strong guy who plays both ends.”Zajac expects to build on his strong two-way play last postseason. “I feel this can be the year I take my game to another level,” he said.With Zajac in the fold, the focus will turn to two other major offensive players, David Clarkson and Patrik Elias, who can be unrestricted free agents. “They both know what we think of them,” said Lamoriello, who typically does not negotiate once the season begins."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/soccer/pep-guardiola-to-be-next-coach-of-bayern-munich.html,"Pep Guardiola, the world’s most sought-after soccer coach, will take over as  head coach of the German powerhouse Bayern Munich at the conclusion of the season.The team announced the hiring Wednesday, bringing to an end months of guesswork and speculation about where Guardiola would land. He stockpiled trophies as the coach of Spain’s Barcelona from 2008 to 2012, overseeing its evolution into one of the world’s elite teams.Guardiola, 41, a native of Santpedor, Spain, will replace Jupp Heynckes, who plans to retire. Guardiola’s contract will run through the summer of 2016. The appointment will end a yearlong sabbatical for Guardiola and present him with a weighty new challenge.“Pep Guardiola is one of the most successful coaches in the world, and we are certain that he can give a lot of luster not only to Bayern but also to German football,” Karl-Heinz Rummenigge, the chairman of Bayern Munich, told the club’s Web site.Bayern Munich, though perhaps not as visible internationally as some of the megateams playing in England and Spain, has long been one of the premier clubs in the world. The club, enjoying a comfortable lead atop the Bundesliga standings, made it to the Champions League finals in 2010 and 2012, losing both times.Fans and pundits will be intrigued to see whether Guardiola can carry the team up one more step, to the pinnacle of world club soccer.Guardiola, who rose as a player through Barcelona’s famed youth system and starred for the senior club as well as the Spanish national team, became Barcelona’s coach in July 2008. He was able to coax from his players the purest expression of the organization’s philosophy, which centers on attractive attacking play.During Guardiola’s first season, Barcelona won six trophies, including La Liga and the Champions League. Barcelona went on to win the league the next two seasons. In 2011, the team won its second Champions League trophy under Guardiola, who was named the 2011 world coach of the year.Guardiola stepped down from the position after the 2011-12 season, in which rival Real Madrid reclaimed the league title, and moved with his wife and young children to New York, far from the epicenter of international soccer. Under his successor, Tito Vilanova, Barcelona has continued to thrive, going unbeaten in 19 league games.During these months, Guardiola has essentially hidden in plain sight, renting a luxurious apartment on Manhattan’s Upper West Side, across the street from Central Park, while making sporadic public appearances and vague public comments.Guardiola’s career plan, as a result, quickly became soccer’s most popular guessing game.Even though Bayern Munich was long among his rumored destinations, his decision to coach there comes as a small surprise. He was always coy about his intentions, but he seemed to hint this week about a desire to coach in England, where teams like Chelsea and Manchester City were said to be interested.“As a player, I couldn’t realize my dream to play there,” Guardiola said in an interview to mark the English Football Association’s 150th anniversary celebrations. “But I hope in the future, I have a challenge to be a coach or a manager there.”But that dream — and the dreams of other clubs hoping to employ him — will have to wait."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/sports/tennis/australian-open-roundup.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Serena Williams cautiously walked onto the court Thursday and tried to keep the points short to avoid irritating her injured right ankle.Summoning all her experience, Williams lifted her tempo on the biggest points, winning an 18-minute game to open the second set and finally cashing in on her fourth break chance. Nineteen minutes later, she finished off a 6-2, 6-0 win over No. 112 Garbine Muguruza of Spain to advance to the third round at the Australian Open. Williams sealed the victory with an ace at 128.7 miles per hour — the fastest she could remember serving, she said.Apart from a swollen lip — from hitting herself in the face with her racket in the sixth game — she emerged unscathed.“I’m on the up and up, I feel; it can only get better from here,” she said, adding that she was not bothered by the ankle during the match.“Obviously when you go out to play, you’re heavy on adrenaline, and you’re really pumped up,” Williams said. “Usually I feel injuries after the match, but so far, so good.”Williams said she was bleeding from her lip at one point. “But it’s O.K.,” she said. “It’s a war wound.”Despite the injury concerns, Williams said she would be playing doubles later Thursday with her sister Venus and would play her next singles match, against Ayumi Morita of Japan on Saturday.Before Serena Williams’s victory, the Australian Open’s defending champion, Victoria Azarenka, practically danced into Rod Laver Arena for her match and said she was starting to find some rhythm after beating Eleni Daniilidou, 6-1, 6-0, in 55 minutes.With temperatures expected to top 102 degrees on Thursday, Azarenka did not want to be out in the heat. (The temperature hit 93 degrees during her match, the first of the day on the center court.)“I felt like I’m back into the competitive mode,” she said. “I was really focused — that was for sure the best part of the game for me.”Daniilidou, ranked No. 94, won only 10 points in the first set and was shut out in the second despite having triple break point in the fourth game. Azarenka will face Jamie Hampton of the United States in the third round.Elsewhere on the women’s side, No. 14 Maria Kirilenko beat China’s Peng Shuai, 7-5, 6-2, and Elena Vesnina beat No. 21 Varvara Lepchenko of the United States, 6-4, 6-2.On the men’s side, Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who made the 2008 Australian final, beat Japan’s Go Soeda, 6-3, 7-6 (1), 6-3; No. 17 Philipp Kohlschreiber of Germany edged the Israeli qualifier Amir Weintraub, 6-2, 7-6 (4), 6-4; and the Lithuanian qualifier Ricardas Berankis ousted No. 25 Florian Mayer, 6-2, 6-3, 6-1.Andy Murray, the 2012 United States Open champion, had another easy win, a 6-2, 6-2, 6-4 victory over Joao Sousa of Portugal. Murray did not allow Sousa a single break point chance."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/sports/cycling/lance-armstrong-stripped-of-2000-olympic-bronze-medal.html,"On the eve of Lance Armstrong’s public admission that he used performance-enhancing drugs during his cycling career, he was stripped of yet another prize: his bronze medal from the 2000 Sydney Olympics.The International Olympic Committee on Wednesday night sent a letter to Armstrong, asking him to return the bronze medal he won in the men’s individual road cycling time trial. The committee had delayed its decision while waiting for Armstrong’s deadline to appeal his doping case. That deadline has passed.Last year, Armstrong, 41, was stripped of his record seven Tour de France titles and all other awards he received starting from Aug. 1, 1998. The record books will not have a winner for those Tours because the sport was rife with doping at the time.Only a few accolades on Armstrong’s cycling résumé remain, including a national and world championship he won in 1993.After years of denying he ever doped, Armstrong is expected to come clean about his drug use in an interview with Oprah Winfrey set to be broadcast on her network on Thursday and Friday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/sports/football/patriots-rob-ninkovich-always-around-the-ball.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — Matt Schaub called it an “oh no” moment. There was his fullback, James Casey, open for a short pass in the middle of the field. All Schaub needed to do was put enough arc on the ball to ensure that New England’s Rob Ninkovich would not get a hand on the ball.Schaub saw Ninkovich. He knew he was there. It still ended up being an “oh no” moment for Houston’s quarterback.“When they ultimately get the ball, that’s definitely an oh no moment,” Schaub said. “You want to get your guy a chance to make a play.”Casey never got that chance. Ninkovich got two hands on the ball for what turned out to be the game-turning play in last Sunday’s 41-28 New England victory over the Texans in their A.F.C. divisional playoff game.Houston trailed by 11 points in the third quarter and was driving into New England territory. Ninkovich’s interception stopped the drive. The Patriots scored a touchdown six plays later, taking a 31-13 lead. Houston fell behind, 38-13, before making a late, inconsequential run. For New England, it might well have been an “oh yeah” moment. Ninkovich not only accounted for the game’s only turnover, but he also recovered an onside kick after Houston pulled to 38-28 with 5 minutes 15 seconds left.Ninkovich has a nose for the ball, whether it is making an interception (his fifth as a Patriot), forcing fumbles (five this season, matching the highest total in the last 20 years for the team) or recovering fumbles (four, a team high). Throw in a career-best eight sacks this season and 61 tackles (47 unassisted) and Ninkovich does seem to have a habit of being around the ball.This is how Ninkovich said he learned to play the game, crediting Rob Glielmi, his high school coach in New Lenox, Ill.“I was taught at a young age to always be around the football because that is where things happen,” Ninkovich said. “If you are around the ball, that is what makes those opportunities come up. The ball comes out, you are right there. It goes back to Rob Glielmi.”Ninkovich is a classic late bloomer. He went unrecruited out of high school and attended Joliet (Ill.) Junior College, where he won a national championship in his first of two seasons. He then moved to Purdue, where he started only five games over two seasons but was still among the team and conference leaders in sacks. The Saints drafted him in the fifth round in the 2006 draft.However valuable and critical he is deemed to be as the Patriots prepare to face the Baltimore Ravens in Sunday’s A.F.C. championship game, he was anything but before arriving in New England in 2009. Before then, he had appeared in only eight games over three seasons in two stints with the Saints and one with the Dolphins. The Saints even tried to make a long snapper out of Ninkovich before releasing him.The Patriots swooped in almost immediately. In four years with New England, he has missed one game, playing both defensive end and outside linebacker. Coach Bill Belichick credited Ninkovich’s skill, adding, “He has good body control, good balance, good hand-eye coordination.”“He’s a high motor guy; he’s always running around the field to make those plays,” defensive back Devin McCourty said.The big difference in New England? Ninkovich actually got a chance to play — and make plays.“I think really with Rob it was just a matter of opportunity,” the Patriots’ player personnel director, Nick Caserio, said. “He came here and he took advantage of his opportunities. Basically, every player that comes in here gets the same opportunity. Rob took advantage and he’s made himself into a pretty good player.”That is exactly how Ninkovich sees it. He is one of only two starters on defense (safety Steve Gregory is the other) not drafted or acquired via trade. But as the Patriots slowly said goodbye to such defensive stalwarts as Mike Vrabel, Junior Seau and Tedy Bruschi, Ninkovich was there to take over. He is as much a fixture on defense now as the All-Pro nose tackle Vince Wilfork.“I think there are a lot of guys that aren’t in the N.F.L. right now because it is about right place, right time, having the opportunity to play,” Ninkovich said. “I was blessed to be able to stick around a couple years without really doing anything.”He is doing plenty now. And if Joe Flacco has an oh no moment Sunday, do not be surprised if Ninkovich is responsible."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/sports/football/49ers-frank-gore-was-a-special-back-at-miami.html,"Antrel Rolle has been playing football against Frank Gore since they were youngsters near Miami. When they were in high school — Rolle at South Dade, Gore a bit north in Coral Gables — Rolle always heard that Gore, blessed with elusiveness, exceptional balance and uncanny field vision, might be the best running back ever to come out of those neighborhoods, which doubled as a recruiter’s dream.Clinton Portis saw it for himself, when, while already a University of Miami running back, he went to Gables High School games to watch the youngster he now considers a protégé playing, he said, with no socks under his cleats, no gloves on his hands, shredding heavily favored opponents by running draws and dives out of four-wide receiver sets. Portis returned to the Hurricanes practices to tell his coaches, “This Frank Gore is special.”Rolle, now a Giants safety, said this week: “You really don’t get a full grasp of what kind of runner he is until you go against him. I will say it to the day I die, going against him, I still feel he was the best running back to come through the University of Miami before his knee injuries.”That is the legend of Frank Gore, one of the most talented players on, perhaps, Miami’s most talented team, who was never as good as he might have been in college. He had to overcome two significant injuries, tearing the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee just after he beat out Willis McGahee in spring practice before Gore’s sophomore season, then the one in his right knee the next season. Those injuries are why the San Francisco 49ers chose clips from Gore’s freshman season when they showed his college highlights before their playoff victory over Green Bay last weekend. That was when, with his knees still unscarred and while splitting time with McGahee and Portis as a true freshman, he averaged 9.1 yards per carry.“At times, I look back and I say if I wouldn’t have been hurt, I would probably have been a top 5 or 10 player coming out,” Gore said in a telephone interview this week. “It didn’t go my way. I look at it as God wanted me to go a different route. Before I got injured, football was very easy, I didn’t have to work out. I guess he wanted me to work hard and appreciate the game that He blessed me with the talent to do. That’s one thing I focus on.”Gore is now one of the N.F.L.’s best running backs, compiling his sixth 1,000-yard season in eight years. He is already San Francisco’s leading career rusher.This season, as the 49ers have transitioned from Alex Smith to Colin Kaepernick at quarterback and advanced to Sunday’s N.F.C. championship game at Atlanta, Gore has been the same quiet, consistent force he has always been. He is not the fastest runner, nor the one with the Adonis physique, but he still reads blocks better than most, and, to Portis’s astonishment, can shake, with his movement and the angles he takes, defenders approaching from behind that he can’t even see.Gore arrived at Miami in 2001, a stroke of luck the then-Miami coach Larry Coker acknowledges occurred because he was recruiting Gore’s best friend, Roscoe Parrish, just 10 days before signing day. Gore grew up in one of Miami’s poorest areas. His mother, Liz, was then seriously ill with kidney disease and on dialysis. Gore struggled for years with dyslexia.But after his first team meeting at Miami, Gore went up to his position coach and told him he wanted to play. He was told he had to learn the 12 pass protections the Hurricanes used. He took the playbook home that night and at 3:30 a.m., less than five hours before practice, he called his coach at home, asking to be quizzed on the pass protections. He had learned them all.More than 11 years later, the film still shows the special player Rolle and Portis and the others saw.“They were saying, ‘Dang, you were fast,’ ” said Don Soldinger, the former Hurricanes running backs coach, whom Gore called after San Francisco beat Green Bay last Saturday. “He was saying ‘I was the best one.’ He put me on the phone with Randy Moss and said, ‘Tell Randy Moss how good I was.’ ”Soldinger had to talk Gore out of quitting after the second knee injury. The doctor who performed the operations, John Uribe, explained to Gore that he would be better than ever once he recovered, because his original ligament structure had not been strong enough for his knees.Portis was already an N.F.L. rookie when Gore injured his knee the first time and remembered that Gore was devastated. He said, in each of their conversations, Gore would ask, “Bro, what do you think?” Portis always told him he could come back. Privately, though, he wondered, just like the coaches and the N.F.L. scouts, if Gore would ever be the same.“I remember thinking, I hope he didn’t lose what he had, because he was so agile, you couldn’t get a hand on him,” Portis said. “I remember thinking, what do you tell him?”It was Soldinger, one of the few guiding forces in Gore’s life then, who finally prevailed upon him.“I was very frustrated,” Gore said. “He talked to me, my mom talked to me, he said keep following my rehab. I was frustrated. I felt like it wasn’t for me. He told me just keep pushing at it. He wanted me to get a chance to reach my childhood dream to have an N.F.L. career.”That he has had one at all is why Coker uses Gore as an example to encourage his players at Texas-San Antonio when they get hurt. When Gore talked to Soldinger after the victory over Green Bay, Soldinger told him he had to make a big push now, to try to propel his team to a championship. Portis regrets that Gore’s mother, who died in 2007, did not live to enjoy what her son has become. She had encouraged him to leave Miami early to go to the N.F.L. after he played a full season following the knee injuries. Gore was certain by then that if he was healthy he could still be productive.On Saturday, Portis watched San Francisco’s victory over Green Bay with Edgerrin James, another former Hurricanes running back, in Los Angeles and the two have plans to be in Atlanta on Sunday, three generations of Hurricanes running backs together. James wondered how much longer Gore would play and Portis guessed four or five more years, because he knows how to avoid taking a pounding to keep his body healthy. Portis wonders if Gore will finish with more yards than any of them — James rushed for 12,246 in his career, Portis for 9,923 and Gore, at age 29, has 8,839.Portis reminisced this week about how eager a freshman Gore was, always sitting next to him on the way to games, always talking about football, always saying, “I can’t wait until my time comes.” On Sunday, Portis talked to Gore on the phone again.“He was still excited,” Portis said. “ ‘Man, you saw that game? What do you think?’ I said, ‘Bro, you got it.’ ”"

Commissioner Roger Goodell in connection with the bounty case involving the Saints was dismissed by a federal judge Thursday.Judge Ginger Berrigan of United States District Court in New Orleans ruled in favor of Goodell’s motion to dismiss Vilma’s complaint, which was filed in May and set out 11 claims. Vilma had argued that Goodell made false statements, tarnishing his reputation, in connection with the league’s investigation of what it determined was a system that offered cash bonuses to Saints players for big hits from 2009 to 2011.Goodell initially suspended Vilma for all of the 2012 season — although he wound up being able to play while appealing — and three other players received shorter bans: Saints defensive end Will Smith and two former Saints, Cleveland linebacker Scott Fujita and free agent defensive lineman Anthony Hargrove. But Paul Tagliabue, Goodell’s predecessor as commissioner, heard a final round of player appeals and threw out the suspensions last month.The N.F.L. spokesman Greg Aiello said neither he nor Goodell would have any comment Thursday about Berrigan’s ruling.ARIZONA HIRES ARIANS The Cardinals have filled the N.F.L.’s final head coaching vacancy by hiring the Indianapolis offensive coordinator Bruce Arians.The team confirmed the hiring in a news release, saying Arians received a four-year contract with a club option for a fifth year.Arians, a 60-year-old longtime assistant, went 9-3 as the Colts’ interim head coach while Chuck Pagano was undergoing treatment for leukemia last season.Arians also was a finalist for the Chicago job that went to Marc Trestman. He was the sixth known candidate interviewed to replace Ken Whisenhunt, whom Arizona fired after six seasons. Whisenhunt was introduced on Thursday as the offensive coordinator for new head coach Mike McCoy in San Diego.JACKSONVILLE NAMES COACH The Jaguars have hired the Seattle defensive coordinator Gus Bradley as the franchise’s fifth head coach, the latest move in a rebuilding project.Bradley, 46, joins General Manager Dave Caldwell, who led the coaching search after being hired last week.Bradley spent the last four seasons in Seattle, earning a reputation as an assistant who demanded — and often got — the most from his defense. It improved each of the last three years and finished in the top 10 in points and yards the last two.Seattle moved quickly to fill Bradley’s position, hiring Dan Quinn away from Florida.EAGLES INTRODUCE KELLY Torn between loyalty to his players and accepting a new challenge, Chip Kelly ultimately chose the N.F.L. and the Philadelphia Eagles. He just needed more time to make the decision.“The hardest thing for me to do was to leave Oregon,” Kelly said at a news conference introducing him as the 21st coach in team history. “I knew it was a great fit, but it was whether I could leave what I have. I love those guys, and it had to be a special place for me to leave.”The Eagles hired Kelly on Wednesday, giving him a five-year contract and ending an exhaustive search to replace Andy Reid. Kelly went 46-7 in four seasons at Oregon.  COORDINATORS IN, AND OUT The Broncos have hired a new offensive coordinator: Adam Gase will be calling the plays next season, replacing Mike McCoy, who left this week to become head coach of the San Diego Chargers.“While we did speak with several qualified candidates, it became clear that Adam was the best fit,” Coach John Fox said.In the N.F.C., Rod Marinelli will not return as Chicago’s defensive coordinator.The team’s new coach, Marc Trestman, said Marinelli had “made up his mind to move on.”Marinelli is a longtime friend of the former coach Lovie Smith, who was fired by the Bears after they missed the playoffs for the fifth time in six seasons.TITANS MAKE MOVES Tennessee Coach Mike Munchak has hired three new assistants — Sylvester Croom, Shawn Jefferson and George Henshaw — but Dowell Loggains will remain the offensive coordinator."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/sports/tennis/australian-open-roundup.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) — Angelique Kerber survived some nervous moments before fending off the American teenager Madison Keys in the third round of the Australian Open, then blew out the candles on a cake to celebrate her 25th birthday.The fifth-seeded Kerber won, 6-2, 7-5, on Friday to move into the fourth round, farther than she has gone in six trips to the Australian Open.Organizers brought a cake onto the court immediately after the match, and the crowd at Rod Laver Arena sang “Happy Birthday.” She blew out the candles and said thank you to the crowd and to the 17-year-old Keys.“Madison is a great young player, and it was very tough,” said Kerber, a semifinalist last year at Wimbledon. “So happy I won today on my birthday!”Kerber will next play No. 19 Ekaterina Makarova of Russia, who advanced after a tough 6-7 (4), 6-3, 6-4 win over the 2007 Wimbledon finalist Marion Bartoli.In the fourth round last year, Makarova defeated Serena Williams and became the first of only four women to beat Williams in 2012. Kerber was the last.In other women’s action Friday, fourth-seeded Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland won her 12th match in a row, a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Britain’s Heather Watson on the second of the show courts at Melbourne Park.“I’m extremely happy to be playing my best tennis from the beginning of the year,” said Radwanska, who won tournaments in Auckland and Sydney before coming to Melbourne. “Hopefully I’ll play on the same level the rest of the tournament.”She will play the 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic, who beat Jelena Jankovic, 7-5, 6-3, in a matchup featuring two Serbians who were both former top-ranked players.Ivanovic surged to a 5-2 lead in the first set but lost the next three games.

In the fourth round, Li will meet No. 18 Julia Goerges of Germany, who downed China’s Zheng Jie, 6-3, 1-6, 7-5.Li won the 2011 French Open a few months after reaching the Australian Open final.After soaring to 106 degrees on Day Four, the temperature dropped into the mid-70s on Friday, and light rain briefly interrupted play on some courts.Venus Williams was scheduled to play second-ranked Maria Sharapova later on Friday.One the men’s side, Novak Djokovic was to resume his bid for a third consecutive Australian Open title, taking on Radek Stepanek in the third round, and No. 4 David Ferrer was to play Marcos Baghdatis in the day’s last match.The British teenager Laura Robson ensured that the Day Four program ran into Day Five when she rallied to oust No. 8-seeded Petra Kvitova, the 2011 Wimbledon champion, 2-6, 6-3, 11-9. After coming from a break down in the third set, Robson missed a chance to serve out the match at 6-5. She made no mistake the second time, in the early hours of Friday.Robson, who combined with Andy Murray to win an Olympic silver medal in the mixed doubles, will next play the 19-year-old American Sloane Stephens, who beat Kristina Mladenovic of France, 6-4, 6-3."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/sports/hockey/minnesota-wild-reignite-fan-interest.html,"ST. PAUL — When it comes to hockey and his beloved Minnesota Wild, Dan Austin can be a patient man.Austin, a 32-year-old dispatcher for a telecommunications company from Coon Rapids, Minn., waited 119 days for the N.H.L. lockout to end. On Wednesday morning, attracted by a half-off sale at a Wild team store in Maplewood, Minn., he endured a two-hour wait to buy a red No. 11 Zach Parise sweater.Then Wednesday afternoon, he joined hundreds of Wild fans in line at Xcel Energy Center, arriving two and a half hours early to grab a good seat for a free intrasquad scrimmage that featured the debuts of the high-profile free agents Parise and Ryan Suter.“I’m super excited,” he said. “It’s incredible. Finally, somebody wanted to come here.”Declining attendance and lackluster play prompted the Wild owner Craig Leipold to lavish identical 13-year, $98 million contracts on Parise, a left wing and the son of former Minnesota North Stars captain J. P. Parise, and Suter, a defenseman from Wisconsin whose father, Bob, played for the 1980 United States Olympic gold medal team. In a state where high school hockey is king, the Wild found significance again. The club sold more than 4,000 season tickets the rest of the summer.Then the lockout hit. Club officials hoped the buzz from the signings would limit resentment among fans, and they may have been right.The Wild distributed 13,096 tickets for the scrimmage, which was televised locally. Factoring in no-shows, Wild chief operating officer Matt Majka estimated attendance at a little more than half of the building’s 18,064 capacity — less than expected, but comparable to the crowd that watched a Buffalo Sabres public practice last Monday at the First Niagara Center.“This is a hockey-crazy city,” Wild right wing Dany Heatley said. “The anticipation we’ve already seen, talking to friends and people around town, I think the city is excited to see this team. Waiting a few months won’t get them any less excited.”Earlier in the day, the Wild announced sellouts for Saturday’s season opener against Colorado and a Feb. 17 game with Detroit. Majka said the club sold 100 more season tickets once the lockout lifted, and the club was nearing its 16,500 maximum on season sales for the first time in more than three years. The half-off sale at the three team stores Wednesday triggered a tenfold increase in jersey sales over a typical game day, Majka said.“Obviously we’re a bit relieved,” General Manager Chuck Fletcher said. “I don’t want this to sound the wrong way, but it doesn’t surprise me, not in the sense that we’re taking our fans for granted.“This is an unbelievable hockey market, in my opinion the best hockey market in the U.S. Everybody has some connection to hockey here, whether they play hockey, their son plays hockey, their dad plays hockey. There are outdoor rinks everywhere. We were hoping this would be the response. It is great to see.”Without Parise and Suter, Majka said: “It would have been a real struggle. I’m pretty convinced we would have gone backwards again with the season ticket base and interest in general. We needed to make something happen.”An expansion franchise that began play in the 2000-1 season, the Wild were an early marketing and branding success in an area that lost the North Stars to Dallas in 1993. The Wild sold out their first 409 games, including exhibitions, through 2010.But the organization produced few stars and could not sustain the promise of its 2003 run to the Western Conference finals under Coach Jacques Lemaire. The Wild made only three playoff appearances in 11 seasons, the last in 2008. Average attendance fell from 18,568 in 2008-9 to 17,772 last season, 18th in the 30-team league. Season ticket sales dropped as well.Offense has always been troublesome. Only two players in franchise history, Marian Gaborik and Brian Rolston, scored as many as 30 goals in a season, a total Parise reached five times with the Devils.Last season the Wild scored 177 goals, the fewest in the N.H.L. Still, Minnesota led the Western Conference with 43 points through Dec. 10 before injuries to the captain Mikko Koivu and others exposed a lack of depth. The Wild lost eight straight and 15 of 17, eventually missing the playoffs for the fourth straight year.“With Zach and Ryan, we’re adding world-class hockey players and two of the best players at their respective positions in the entire league,” Fletcher said. “After some nonplayoff years, we needed a little of both talent and character.”Wild Coach Mike Yeo paired Parise on a line with center Koivu and right wing Heatley. Parise spent the lockout in the Twin Cities, skating several times a week with a dozen or more teammates. He said that helped him adjust to new teammates, new surroundings and the heightened expectations that come with a bold move like this.“Around here, throughout the whole lockout, you’d see people in the grocery store and the gym, and all of them said, ‘We can’t wait for you to get back on the ice,’ ” Parise said. “I never had an encounter with anyone that had hard feelings toward anything.“I understand that some fans do, and they have every right to. It was an ugly thing. Now it’s up to us as players to go out and work hard and have a good team on the ice.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/football/greg-roman-is-the-49ers-quarterback-whisperer.html,"SANTA CLARA, Calif. — On Friday, the San Francisco 49ers packed their belongings into expensive suitcases, traded insults and answered several dozen of the same questions about the N.F.C championship game, about Colin Kaepernick, the Atlanta Falcons, Michael Crabtree, the pistol offense, Frank Gore, the read option, LaMichael James, Alex Smith and Randy Moss.Amid all this chatter and one win from the Super Bowl, Coach Jim Harbaugh made sure to highlight perhaps the most underrated, overshadowed person in another dominant 49ers season. Unprompted, he heaped praise on his offensive coordinator, Greg Roman, the maestro of all the 49ers’ moving parts.The 49ers will play the Falcons in Atlanta on Sunday for the conference championship and a trip to the Super Bowl in New Orleans, and it is Roman who brought together all their disparate elements. It is Roman who revamped the offense when Kaepernick replaced Smith. It is Roman who incorporated the pistol last week against the Green Bay Packers, who worked in James, who kept Gore happy, who helped Crabtree fulfill his promise.It is Roman who made the 49ers’ offense unpredictable, formidable, dangerous — less of a weakness and more of a strength.“The job that Greg has done this year is really in so many ways just one of the best I’ve ever seen,” Harbaugh said. “And we’ll talk about that later. We’ve got a job to do right now. But he’s a shining star in my book.”Harbaugh smiled one of those tight, uncomfortable smiles, and soon afterward he walked back into the locker room. No more questions. Time to play.As San Francisco advanced deep into the playoffs, the N.F.L.’s coaching carousel spun even faster than usual. Coaches were fired. Names were floated. Interviews were conducted. Hires were made. Roman’s name surfaced during all that activity, but not as often as might be expected for a coordinator in the conference title game for the second year in a row.Fans of the 49ers seemed particularly concerned that Roman would end up in Jacksonville, with the Jaguars and their new general manager, David Caldwell, his former college roommate. Except Jacksonville hired Gus Bradley, the defensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks, who lost at Atlanta last week. Roman told reporters that this did not bother him, that he had a more important focus. But message boards celebrated his impending return.In many ways, San Francisco’s varied approach to offensive football mirrors the background of Roman, its offensive coordinator. He started coaching with the Carolina Panthers in 1995, as a strength and conditioning assistant and defensive quality control coach, the lowest rung on the N.F.L. coaching ladder. He would later instruct tight ends, quarterbacks, offensive linemen and running backs, in Houston and Baltimore and at Stanford University.He joined the Cardinal in 2009 and helped oversee an offense that was among the most productive in the college game. He helped develop Andrew Luck and then joined Harbaugh in San Francisco, where he helped Smith revive his career and helped turn Kaepernick into a household name.Roman’s offense, like his background, cannot be quantified by a single position or philosophy. He views the rushing game as the basis for all offense, but sometimes this season he leaned toward the pass and sometimes, like last week against the Packers, he asked the quarterback to run wild. He called plays as if averse to patterns, which drew criticism when the offense stalled.“Every game is different,” Roman said this week. “No matter how you look at it, you have to pay homage to the football gods every week in practice, in meetings, in your preparation. Then you have to go out and perform on game day.”Spoken like a true coach. This week, Roman’s attitude typified that of the 49ers, a loose bunch that spoke of a different locker room vibe compared with that for the N.F.C. championship appearance last season, which San Francisco lost. Moss, the moody veteran receiver whom Harbaugh said Friday that he wanted to bring back next season, sauntered toward his locker, laughing, smiling, joking with his teammates.Offensive lineman Joe Staley, the anchor of a unit considered among the best in the N.F.L., sat surrounded by reporters. “We don’t have to go outside ourselves and do anything crazy in this offense,” he said. “We’re ready to go with whatever we put out there. We know what to expect this season.”The 49ers know what a conference championship game feels like, but the Falcons must prepare for Roman’s whims. When Roman met with the news media this week, he talked about Gore’s adjustment to the read option, about James’s versatility, about Kaepernick’s ability to block out distractions — all those moving parts at his disposal.“I don’t think there’s any hump we feel we have to get over,” Roman said. “It’s a must-win game. It’s win or go home. Everybody has a real true sense of that.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/hockey/martin-brodeur-of-devils-eager-to-lead-team-again.html,"NEWARK — When the Devils made a stunning march to the Stanley Cup finals last season after finishing sixth in the Eastern Conference, they inadvertently breathed new life into the career of goaltender Martin Brodeur.“I sat back after the run and said, ‘Wow, I’m going to miss this if I decide not to re-sign,’ ” said the 40-year-old Brodeur, who agreed to a two-year deal in July worth $9 million.Two years ago, Brodeur first began pondering retirement, he said. The Devils began that season 9-22-2 before Coach John MacLean was fired. They made a belated charge under the interim coach Jacques Lemaire but missed the playoffs for the first time since the 1995-96 season, finishing 4th in the Atlantic Division and 11th in the conference.“Hockey wasn’t really enjoyable,” said Brodeur, who stood tall when the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995, 2000 and 2003. “I’m not used to being on losing teams.”The self-doubt that crept in as he compiled a 23-26 record with a 2.45 goals-against average only added to his malaise. For the first time since he won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in 1993-94, Brodeur began to wonder if he was part of the problem, after being the solution for so long.“When the team is not doing well and you can’t do anything about it — you’re playing hard, and nothing is going on — you question yourself a little bit,” said Brodeur, a 10-time All-Star.Although the Devils lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games in last year’s Stanley Cup finals, the seemingly magical playoff run past the Florida Panthers in seven games, the Philadelphia Flyers in five games and the archrival Rangers in six games emphatically answered any such questioning Brodeur might have done. A winner of the Vezina Trophy four times as the N.H.L.’s outstanding goaltender, he proved to be as resurgent as his team.“I felt like when I was 25,” he said.He has continued to not act his age — he turns 41 on May 6 — since the Devils returned for a six-day training camp before their 48-game schedule begins on the road Saturday against the Islanders. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Brodeur will be the third-oldest player in the N.H.L. this season, behind Teemu Selanne, 42, of the Anaheim Ducks and Jaromir Jagr of the Dallas Stars, who turns 41 next month.“He’s an amazing athlete,” said Coach Peter DeBoer, who is entering his second season with the Devils. “He’s the most enthusiastic guy on the ice, and he’s going on 41 years old. That’s contagious.”Entering his 20th season with the Devils, Brodeur seemingly has little left to accomplish, and certainly nothing left to prove. He helped Canada bring home a gold medal at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. He holds N.H.L. records for regular-season wins (656) and shutouts (119). And yet, after playing 70,028 minutes and appearing in 1,191 games, Brodeur is spurring on teammates almost two decades younger.“He loves to compete, even at his age,” center Travis Zajac, 27, said. “He loves coming on the ice, stopping us and letting us know he stopped us.”As Johan Hedberg, an effective complement to Brodeur in net, sees it, attitude is almost everything.“To be able to stay at this level when you get older, you need enthusiasm or you get out of the game way earlier,” Hedberg said.Brodeur was a mainstay when the Devils used a 48-game schedule as a springboard to their first Stanley Cup, in 1994-95. Because of the mix of accomplished veterans and rising young players on the current roster, Brodeur again sees delicious possibilities, despite the free-agency loss of the team captain Zach Parise, a force on offense.“I always love to play the game,” Brodeur said. “But when you see potential, for sure it’s exciting.”Much, of course, will depend on Brodeur’s ability to provide his usual nerveless consistency.“I’d like to play a lot of games, because it is a short season,” he said. “The playoffs will come quickly, and if we do get in, you want to be as sharp as you can.”With the Devils scheduled to play on consecutive days nine times, DeBoer will probably split those between his two goalies. He said he did not have a plan for how the rest of the starts would be managed.Another key question for Brodeur involves how much longer he will play.“I signed for two, so I’m going to honor those two and see if somebody else wants me after,” he said, sounding as if the end were nowhere near."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/football/jets-select-john-idzik-general-manager-and-marty-mornhinweg-as-offensive-coordinator.html,"The Jets’ roster lacks quality and depth. There is disarray at quarterback. Their salary-cap situation is daunting.On Friday, they hired two men to help them deal with those problems. An extensive 19-day search ended when the Jets selected John Idzik, formerly the vice president for football administration for the Seattle Seahawks, as their general manager.In a move that may carry risks, the Jets selected a candidate thoroughly experienced in salary-cap management and contract negotiations — much like his predecessor, Mike Tannenbaum — and not player evaluation and scouting. Idzik, 52, emerged from a field of 10 interviewed contenders, including former general managers, current personnel executives and administrators on the business side.Idzik’s arrival came on the same day Coach Rex Ryan made the most critical decision of his tenure, choosing Marty Mornhinweg, who spent the previous 10 seasons with the Philadelphia Eagles, as the team’s offensive coordinator. The Jets, who went 6-10 this season, lost nine members of their coaching staff in the last three weeks.Just as Ryan will be judged for how Mornhinweg, his third offensive coordinator in three seasons, fares in implementing his desire for an unpredictable and attacking offense, Idzik will be evaluated for his attempt to resolve the Jets’ quarterback quandary. He will decide the fate of Mark Sanchez, whose prohibitive contract — $8.25 million guaranteed — increases the possibility that he will remain with the team in some capacity for 2013, and of Tim Tebow, who is all but certain to be traded or released.Idzik will also need to revamp an offense devoid of playmakers and dismantle, then rebuild, a roster in a salary-cap crunch: the Jets are roughly $20 million over the projected salary cap of $121 million.It will be Mornhinweg’s responsibility to mold that new offensive talent into a cohesive, productive group. Mornhinweg’s hiring is the clearest signal yet that the Jets will adjust their philosophy, shifting from the so-called ground-and-pound to a more West Coast-style passing offense — shorter, horizontal routes — that produced four of the top five scoring seasons in Eagles history. His familiarity with Michael Vick may fuel speculation that, after Vick’s expected departure from Philadelphia, he could find a home with the Jets, although it is unclear why they would want essentially an amalgamation of Sanchez and Tebow: a left-handed, turnover-prone quarterback.Idzik, who has a bachelor’s degree in mathematics from Dartmouth and a master’s degree in liberal studies from Duke, has spent the last 20 seasons in the N.F.L. — 11 with Tampa Bay, 3 with Arizona and 6 in Seattle, where his responsibilities included contract negotiations, salary-cap compliance and football operations budgeting. Idzik, who will report directly to the team owner Woody Johnson, will also work closely with Ryan, who had significant input on roster construction under Tannenbaum. Johnson has guaranteed Ryan’s return for 2013.Despite Johnson’s recent assertion that Ryan is the “perfect” coach for the Jets, his status could be endangered if Idzik, after next season, feels differently.As reflected by the first wave of candidates in the search led by Jed Hughes of the recruiting firm Korn/Ferry, the Jets were initially interested in finding someone with experience in player personnel. They considered two candidates who accepted general manager positions elsewhere — David Caldwell (Jacksonville) and Tom Telesco (San Diego) — and it was only after they expanded their pursuit, about 10 days ago, that Idzik emerged as an option. He interviewed last week and again Wednesday before being offered the position.Only one other candidate — Omar Khan, the director of business and football administration for Pittsburgh — had a second interview.In a statement, Johnson said Idzik’s experience working with coaches like Pete Carroll, Tony Dungy and Mike Holmgren was an asset. “John has seen firsthand what’s necessary to construct a winning team,” Johnson, said, adding, “Drawing on 20 years of N.F.L. experience, John, working with Rex, will get the Jets where all of us want to be.”Mornhinweg, who emerged from a group of candidates that also included the New Orleans quarterback coach Joe Lombardi and the former Browns coach Pat Shurmur, has spent the last 18 seasons in the N.F.L. — 16 on offensive staffs and 2, in 2001 and 2002, as the Detroit Lions’ head coach."

But this is as close to a man-crush as there is for the otherwise taciturn Belichick, at least given his excessive praise of opposing players over the years.He lauds them all, of course. That’s part of the Belichick Way. But you can tell when he means it and you can tell when he’s being bromidic, which is much of the time. But he saves a little something for Reed.Last year, for example, Belichick was asked about Reed three straight days. After the question on Day 3, he said, “Haven’t we had enough on Ed Reed?” Then he went on to declare: “He’s the best weak safety I’ve seen since I’ve been in the National Football League in my career. He’s outstanding at pretty much everything.” Belichick was not through: “The list goes on and on with him. It’s just a question of pretty much anything he’s out there for, he’s good at.”Belichick said that he had always admired Reed from afar but got to know and appreciate him a lot more when he coached the A.F.C. team in the 2007 Pro Bowl. Reed was a starter in the game, a 31-28 A.F.C. victory.Two videos on YouTube also portray Belichick as the ultimate Reed-a-holic. The first is from a chat between the two before a New England-Baltimore game at Gillette Stadium on Oct. 4, 2009. Belichick tells Reed: “You’re the best free safety that has ever played this game that I’ve seen. You’re awesome.”Belichick then refers to a play Reed made the week before, adding, “Give me a break.” Then the men part with Belichick saying, “Good seeing you, buddy.”The Patriots went on to win, 27-21. Reed had four tackles.The other video came courtesy of “A Football Life” on NFL Network in 2011. It shows Belichick and quarterback Tom Brady studying film of Reed in Belichick’s office.“I think we know about Ed,” Belichick says to Brady.“Ed Reed is Ed Reed,” Brady replies.Belichick says: “Everything he does, he does at an exceptional level. He looks like he’s guessing a lot more than he even should.” Belichick continues: “It’s so obvious when he’s reading a quarterback. Those receivers run right by him and he never flinches. They just run right by him.”Brady then offers, “You’re always aware of where Ed is,” adding, “Every time you break the huddle, that’s who you’re looking at.”Reed merits the extra attention. He won the N.F.L. Defensive Player of the Year Award in 2004, his third year in the league. The 2007 Pro Bowl he spent with Belichick is one of nine to which he has been selected. He is the N.F.L. career leader in interception return yards (1,541) and his 61 interceptions are tops among active players (and 10th over all). He has recorded 13 nonoffensive touchdowns in his career, third among active players behind the Bears’ Devin Hester and Tampa Bay’s Ronde Barber.He is not showing any signs of slipping, either. This season, he had his most tackles (58) since 2006, and his four interceptions topped the three he had in 2011. He had eight in 2010 and nine in 2008. He also is one of two members of the Baltimore defense to start every game this season.When Belichick was asked on Wednesday what he admired about Reed’s career, the Patriots coach said, simply, “It’s everything.”He then went on.“He’s had fabulous production at whatever he’s done, including blocking kicks and returning kicks and things like that,” Belichick said. “His interceptions, his interception return yardages, his instinctiveness and his play-making ability, how consistent he’s been over time. He just does things that nobody else at that position does or I don’t know if they’ve ever done it. He’s special. He’s really special.”Reed did not respond to requests this week to address Belichick’s feelings for him — or anything else regarding this Sunday’s game. He was not among 14 quoted Baltimore players this week on any of the transcripts distributed by the Ravens’ public relations department.However, last year, he did address the situation before the A.F.C. championship game against the Patriots.“He’s a winner, for one,” Reed said of Belichick. “I had an opportunity to talk to Coach Belichick a couple times and had him over there at the Pro Bowl. Just watching ‘A Football Life’ with Coach Belichick, you can’t do anything but have much respect for Coach Belichick and the way he runs things. He allows football players to be football players.”After the Patriots defeated Houston last Sunday, ensuring a rematch against Reed and the Ravens in the A.F.C. championship game, Belichick was asked only two questions about the Ravens. One began with the prospect of facing Reed the following Sunday.“I don’t look forward to it at all,” Belichick said, but he added: “I’m glad we’re playing him, let’s put it that way. Ed is a great football player.”All that is missing is for Reed to join the Patriots and really make Belichick’s day. It could happen. Reed’s contract is up at the end of the year. The Ravens’ Web site, noting that Reed is unsigned, also reports that Reed does not have an agent. Actually, he does. It’s the coach of the New England Patriots."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/tennis/gussie-moran-tennis-star-dies-at-89.html,"Gussie Moran, who as a ranked American tennis player in 1949 caused an international stir and gained worldwide fame for competing at Wimbledon while wearing a short skirt and lace-trimmed underwear, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 89.She had recently been hospitalized with cancer, Jack Neworth, a tennis writer and friend, said.Moran’s daring outfit worn in a bastion of English propriety won her more renown than her tennis playing, though she was ranked as high as No. 4 in the United States, won the United States women’s indoor championship in 1949 and reached the quarterfinals that year at Wimbledon.By the end of her life she had come to know hardship — bouncing from job to job, living in near squalor, telling of abortions and rape. At her death she lived in a small apartment. But for a time, more than half a century ago, she was a household name around the world. A racehorse, an airplane and a sauce were named after her.Moran, who was 25 at the time, arrived in London for Wimbledon in June 1949 with a new outfit in mind, having already reached out to the British designer Teddy Tinling to create one.“I wrote him a letter prior to Wimbledon, asking him if he would design me something with one sleeve one color, the other sleeve another color and the shirt another color,” Moran told The Orlando Sentinel in 1988. “He wrote back, ‘Have you lost your mind?’ ”Tinling, a former tennis player and for many years the official Wimbledon host, told The Associated Press during the tournament that Moran had asked him to make her “look more feminine.”Sticking to Wimbledon’s all-white dress code, Tinling came up with a white silk sun-top jersey with a tight waist and bodice and a short skirt that boldly bared her knees. Underneath were matching white silk jersey panties trimmed with two inches of open lace.Moran displayed her outfit during a pretournament tea party at the Hurlingham Club, instantly inspiring a nickname. “Gorgeous Gussie’s Lace-Fringed Panties No. 1 Attraction on Wimbledon’s Courts,” a headline in The New York Times declared after the tea party preview.By the time of her opening match, photographers were jostling for position, many lying flat, the better to catch the most risqué angle as she served the ball. They were not disappointed.“The fringed panties are very much in evidence when Gussie races across the court or leaps for a high shot,” The A.P. reported.Moran, who was noted for a powerful forehand, won her match, defeating Bea Walter of Britain, but it was her underwear that became front-page news and a subject of debate in the British Parliament. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the home of Wimbledon, accused Moran of “bringing vulgarity and sin into tennis.”Although Moran did not wear the lace panties for the rest of the tournament, the sensation they caused made her one of the biggest attractions in women’s tennis. She made a cameo appearance in the 1952 sports movie “Pat and Mike” with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The newspapers reported on her romantic life. And her underwear, soon christened “Gussie panties,” started a trend. Women began taking to the court in lace panties, T-shirts and plunging necklines.“Gussie was the Anna Kournikova of her time,” the former tennis champion Jack Kramer told The Los Angeles Times in 2002, referring to the Russian star and sometime model. “Gussie was a beautiful woman with a beautiful body. If Gussie had played in the era of television, no telling what would have happened. Because, besides everything else, Gussie could play.”But there were negative repercussions, too. Wimbledon banned short dresses from the tournament. By 1950 there were grumblings among the tennis elite that the attention Moran had received was unmerited, in light of her being ranked seventh among American women at the time. In 1951 the United States Lawn Tennis Association banned lace panties and low-neckline attire from its tournament in Forest Hills, Queens, that would become the United States Open.Tinling had to resign as official Wimbledon host and was not to be welcomed back until 1983, seven years before his death. In the meantime he had designed tennis wear for players like Chris Evert, Evonne Goolagong, Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade. Tennis wear evolved as well, rendering Moran’s outfit relatively tame by today’s standards.“Gussie wasn’t a revolutionary,” Tinling once told The Times. “She wore the dress for two reasons. She wanted to look good, and the shorter dresses allowed her to move more freely on the court.”Gertrude Agusta Moran was born on Sept. 8, 1923, in Santa Monica, Calif., and grew up in a grand Victorian house overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Her father, Harry, was a sound technician at Universal Studios, and her mother, Emma, was a housewife.Moran said she learned to play tennis when she was 11. While competing on a junior circuit, she and other young players were sometimes invited to play at Charlie Chaplin’s house on Sunday afternoons, trading volleys with stars like Greta Garbo and Olivia de Havilland.During World War II, after her older brother was declared missing in action, Moran joined the war effort, going to work at the nearby Douglas Aircraft Company.She was well into her 20s when she joined the amateur tennis circuit, in 1947, relatively late for a newcomer. But in nine months she won three major tournaments. Her victory in the National Indoor Tennis Tournament in March 1949 was on the wooden courts at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, where she defeated Nancy Chaffee.Moran retired from amateur tennis in August 1950 and signed a one-year, $75,000 contract to play on a professional tour run by Bobby Riggs.Playing alongside Pauline Betz, Moran did not do well on the tour and left it after the year was up. She then began playing exhibition matches at military bases and hospitals as part of a tour managed by the tennis great Bill Tilden. She also joined a U.S.O. tour.Moran went on to work in radio as a sports director and in television hosting interview shows, all in Los Angeles. She was also a radio sportscaster in New York on WMGM, marketed her own line of tennis clothes, wrote for tennis magazines and taught tennis. In 1970 she joined a U.S.O. tour in Vietnam and sustained broken bones when a helicopter in which she was riding was shot down. She continued to compete in tournaments into her early 40s, Neworth said.She also publicly spoke of having abortions and of being found backstage beaten and raped during a Lawrence Welk concert at a Santa Monica centennial celebration. There was no arrest.Moran had three marriages, none lasting more than two years. She had no children. In her later years she went from job to job, often living in reduced circumstances after losing her home in the 1980s. At one point, largely supported by friends and fans, she was reported to be living with cats in a single room in a run-down building in Hollywood, the curtains made of bedsheets. In recent years she sold her tennis memorabilia and autographs online.At the height of her celebrity, Moran expressed frustration with all the attention she was receiving, some of it, in the gossip columns, exasperating. It was a Wimbledon title that she wanted more than anything else, she said.“Publicity follows me,” she wrote in an article for The A.P. at the time. “I cannot help it if people cook up phony quotes about engagements with tennis players I’ve never even seen off the court. I am interested in clothes I can play tennis in, not in creating a sensation and certainly not in anything anyone at all would consider in poor taste.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/golf/pga-tour-rookie-russell-henley-off-to-blazing-start.html,"LA QUINTA, Calif. — Rory McIlroy wielded his new Nike clubs like weed whackers, chopping his way around the Abu Dhabi Golf Club this week on his way to consecutive rounds of 75 that left him outside the cut line. Using the same equipment with much less fanfare is another 23-year-old, Russell Henley, who’s quietly off to one of the fastest starts in PGA Tour history.Henley won his first tour start as a rookie at the Sony Open last week, and he carded his fourth sub-65 score in five competitive rounds Thursday, with a 64 at the Humana Challenge. Only two tour players, Robert Garrigus and Ryan Palmer, posted five rounds under 65 in all of 2012.Could Henley keep his limbo dance of a debut going? One of the larger galleries of the day assembled at the Palmer Private course at PGA West to find out. Henley made a birdie and an eagle on the first six holes to improve to 11 under, and that’s how he finished, posting a three-under 69, his highest score in six rounds. Henley is three strokes behind the leaders, Roberto Castro and James Hahn, who posted 67s.“The way I felt over the ball, that was a pretty good score,” said Henley, who was named the college player of the year in 2010 while at Georgia. He added: “I didn’t play that well today. I hung in there.”With a victory, Henley would become the first tour rookie to win his first two starts. Not that he would dare think that far ahead.“I’m not really putting a lot of pressure on myself to do that,” he said. “I’m enjoying every aspect of golf and not getting too caught up in what I should be shooting or what I could shoot.“I’m just not worried so much about pulling off a shot or making a perfect decision or shooting a great score,” he said.Henley had to blast himself out of that trap last year. After failing to advance to the final round of 2012 tour qualifying school, Henley returned to the Web.com circuit, where he had won an event in 2011 as an amateur, and missed the cut in 6 of his first 13 starts.As soon as he lowered his expectations, his scores began to drop. In his last 13 starts of 2012, Henley recorded seven top-10 finishes, including two victories.“Golf’s a lot easier and so is life when you kind of lower those expectations on what you should do,” he said. “It’s funny how when you don’t worry about it as much or you don’t try as hard, you play better.”It’s easy for Henley to have a light grip after earning a spot in the Masters and a two-year exemption with his victory in Honolulu. He said Friday he had been weighed down this week by the hospitalization of a woman who is like a second mother to him. One of the woman’s sons, who is among Henley’s closest friends, sent him a photograph of her watching the first round from her hospital bed.“She said watching me play was keeping her going,” Henley said.Henley’s longtime girlfriend, Molly Rumph, watched the end of the Sunday telecast of the Sony Open at a bar in Charleston, S.C., where she and Henley live. She was joined by a few friends, who turned the final round into a drinking game. Every time Henley made a birdie putt, they consumed a shot. Little did they know he would birdie the last five holes.The next day, Henley said, he received a text from one of the friends, who wrote: “Hey, man, I’m struggling today. Good playing, though.”Putting is Henley’s hallmark. He had seven one-putts on the final back nine last Sunday and has 53 putts in the first two rounds here.“If it weren’t for my putter, I probably would have shot 70-something,” Henley said. “Your swing’s not going to be perfect every day. To get away with a 69 today, I’m a little bit relieved, honestly. But at the same time, I wouldn’t be beating myself up too much if I came in with something higher.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/hockey/penguins-sidney-crosby-healthy-and-eager-as-nhl-season-begins.html,"PITTSBURGH — At the Pittsburgh Penguins’ open scrimmage Wednesday, more than 18,000 fans filled Consol Energy Center after lining up for hours outside. Club officials opened the arena’s luxury boxes to accommodate the overflow, but they still had to turn people away.On the ice, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, two of the best players in the world, swooped in on the power play, setting it in motion like a giant clockwork mechanism while the crowd roared in delight. This was what the fans had desired through almost four months of a lockout — N.H.L. hockey, with all its skill and passion.Excitement reigns through much of the league as a condensed 48-game season begins Saturday. The question of whether fans will come back after the league’s third lockout since 1994 may have been answered by the crowds at free open practices and scrimmages held during brief training camps: 6,500 in St. Louis, 10,000 in Buffalo, 12,000 in Vancouver, 13,000 in Minnesota, 15,000 in Philadelphia, 17,000 in Montreal, 18,000 in Pittsburgh.Most of those fans turned out before the N.H.L. bought full-page newspaper ads in every league city Thursday to apologize for the lockout.Other questions will take longer to answer. Will Rick Nash’s scoring provide the Rangers with the last piece of a Stanley Cup puzzle? Was the Los Angeles Kings’ run to last year’s Cup a fluke, or can they become the first repeat champions since the Detroit Red Wings in 1998? Can the Devils, the defending Eastern Conference champions, survive without Zach Parise, who signed with the Minnesota Wild? Will the Edmonton Oilers’ multitude of young stars revive memories of Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri and Mark Messier? And, of course, will the Toronto Maple Leafs go a 46th consecutive year without a Cup?But the most important question in this season’s sprint to the Stanley Cup is a familiar one: Has Crosby fully recovered from the series of concussions that limited him to 22 regular-season games and 6 playoff games since Jan. 1, 2011?He says yes.“I feel good,” Crosby said. “I had a great summer. I was able to train and push myself. It’s much nicer not to think about it.”It has been a long wait. He signed a 12-year, $104.4 million contract extension in June, took an active union role during the lockout, even played goalie for a ball hockey game in a Pittsburgh recreational league. Through it all, he said his symptoms did not return.Last season Crosby, 25, played eight games in his initial return in November, but he experienced symptoms again and missed three more months. He finished with 37 points in 22 games but was never 100 percent.Asked whether he was always worrying that the symptoms would return, he said: “Probably a little bit — not to the point where I changed the way I played or anything like that. That’s human nature when you go through something for that long. You probably do double-check after you get a hit.”Crosby and the Penguins will open the season Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia for a reprise of last spring’s brawl-filled playoff series against the Flyers, which included a fight between Crosby and Claude Giroux. Philadelphia fans tend to hate Crosby, and he said he was looking forward to returning to the Flyers’ rink.“It’s going to be great to be thrown into that really early,” Crosby said. “It’s been that way there since my first year. Those are fun games.”Still, Crosby has not played a real game since last year’s first-round loss to the Flyers, so the concussion question will linger.Questions of game fitness are facing players across the league. The emerging consensus is that those who joined teams in Europe during the lockout are in far better shape than those who skated informally at home.“The guys that have played hockey games have a significant advantage over those who have not played for months and months and months,” Penguins Coach Dan Bylsma said.Malkin, last season’s most valuable player with 50 goals and a league-leading 109 points, is razor-sharp after spending the lockout in the Kontinental Hockey League with his hometown club, Metallurg Magnitogorsk. He was No. 2 in K.H.L. scoring when the lockout ended, with 23 goals and 65 points in 37 games.“He looks unbelievable if you ask me,” Malkin’s teammate Pascal Dupuis said. “He did last year, so I’m glad he kept playing over there.”Malkin, who had major surgery on his right knee in 2011, said he was in good shape. “Nothing is sore,” he said.That bodes well for the roughly 200 players who went overseas during the lockout, like the Islanders’ John Tavares, the Boston Bruins’ Tyler Seguin, the Montreal Canadiens’ Tomas Plekanec and the Devils’ Ilya Kovalchuk, all of whom excelled with their European clubs.It may also bode ill for teams like the Vancouver Canucks, the Presidents’ Trophy winners last year for having the best regular-season record. Only three Vancouver players competed in Europe during the lockout.Dr. Robert S. Gotlin, the director of orthopedic and sports rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center, said the N.B.A. saw a significant rise in muscle pulls and in ankle and hamstring injuries after its lockout last season.“Practicing is not the same as game conditions for a player, physically or mentally,” Gotlin, a former doctor for the Knicks, said. “Those who just practiced will be more prone to injuries.”Canucks forward David Booth is expected to miss four to six weeks after a groin pull at training camp. That is a long time in a 99-day regular season. Still, teams will be playing only one extra game per month under the condensed schedule, and travel will be reduced with no games against out-of-conference opponents.But players agree it will be more intense.“I really can’t wait for this to get started,” Crosby said. “I’m ready. We’re all ready.”"

Hoffenheim and Borussia Mönchengladbach played to a 0-0 draw, and Mainz and Freiburg also ended scoreless.Mandzukic took his season total to 11 goals by scoring in each half in Munich.A WIN FOR GRANADA Granada beat Rayo Vallecano, 2-0, for its first home win in seven games in the Spanish league.Rayo defender Jordi Amat scored an own goal in the 24th minute when he redirected Allan Nyom’s cross into his own net while under pressure from Granada striker Odion Ighalo.After both goalkeepers made several saves, José García del Pozo sealed the hosts’ victory in the 80th with a long-range shot. Granada’s second home victory in 10 games this season lifted it 3 points above the relegation zone.SOUTH AFRICA GETS A POINT With the sound of bleating vuvuzelas filling the Soccer City stadium in Johannesburg, hosts South Africa and Cape Verde Islands drew, 0-0, in an error-strewn opening match of the Africa Nations Cup.Cape Verde wasted a golden opportunity to take an early lead in the game when Platini was put through on goal by Babanco after 13 minutes, but with only goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune to beat, he scuffed his left-footed shot, sending it well wide.The game improved a bit after halftime as play became more stretched, but neither goalkeeper was seriously tested until Khune was forced to scramble a Héldon header away for a corner after 70 minutes. (REUTERS)DEL PIERO SCORES FOUR The former Italy and Juventus star Alessandro Del Piero scored four goals as Sydney routed last-place Wellington, 7-1, in Australia’s A-League.Del Piero found his form after an injury-plagued season to score in the 20th, 23rd, 39th and 70th minutes, giving Sydney an emphatic win that moved it away from the bottom of the standings.Sydney signed Del Piero to a reported two-year, $4 million contract to be its marquee player in the 10-team league, but the club had slumped as Del Piero battled hamstring and other injuries. Del Piero’s performance, however, in front of 12,691 fans on Saturday was probably one of the best individual efforts ever in the A-League.The margin of victory was Sydney’s largest in an A-League match and, in part, countered its 7-2 loss to league-leading Central Coast earlier this season.Del Piero, 38, led a much-improved team performance, providing the finishing touches in a win that lifted Sydney as high as sixth place in the A-League, pending the outcome of other matches this weekend.For Wellington, the loss ensured it equaled its worst losing streak of four games and left it anchored at the bottom of the standings.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/sports/football/smith-and-boldin-give-the-ravens-dynamic-bookends-at-wide-receiver.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — The transformation was subtle, imperceptible to the Denver Broncos, to the 76,732 fans cramming Sports Authority Field at Mile High, to the millions of viewers tuning in around the country — to everyone, it seemed, but a lone man standing along the Baltimore Ravens’ sideline.When the pass took flight, with 41 seconds remaining before halftime, that man, Jim Hostler, watched it. He watched Torrey Smith morph into Anquan Boldin. His relentlessness, his superior coordination in midair, his eyes and hands working in concert as he soared above Denver cornerback Champ Bailey — it was as if Smith had incorporated all of Boldin’s instructions these last two seasons on a single magnificent play, a 32-yard touchdown.“That’s how Q plays the game,” said Hostler, the Ravens’ receivers coach, referring to Boldin by a nickname. “And now, Torrey can, too.”Smith, who turns 24 next Saturday, cites Boldin’s tutelage as a major factor in his development, but theirs is a symbiotic relationship. Boldin mentors Smith, who leaned on him last summer when he “couldn’t really walk and chew gum at the same time” and has since emerged as a speedy big-play threat. Smith, in turn, stretches the defense, which creates opportunities for Boldin underneath and on intermediate routes.Together they have tormented opponents in Baltimore’s surge to Sunday’s A.F.C. championship rematch at New England, alternately taking star turns. In the Ravens’ victory against Indianapolis, Boldin set the franchise’s postseason receiving record with 145 yards, on five catches that showcased his array of skills: over the shoulder, in double coverage, with an arm in his face. In their double-overtime upset of top-seeded Denver, Smith burned Bailey, one of the league’s most decorated cornerbacks, for two deep touchdown passes.Their personalities contrast as starkly as their styles — Smith is genial and expressive, Boldin private and intense — but they are bonded by their past, by adversity that shaped them then, that influences them now.For Smith, his electrifying performance in Denver was his most complete game since Sept. 23, when he carved up the Patriots with 6 catches for 127 yards and 2 touchdowns in a 31-30 victory. On Wednesday, he explained his success by saying, “I just happened to play well against them.”Receiver Jacoby Jones offered a different reaction.“I told him, ‘Man, I look up to you,’ ” Jones said. “I couldn’t have done what you did.”Just before midnight on Sept. 22, Smith’s younger brother Tevin Jones, 19, crashed his motorcycle into a utility pole in their native Virginia. He died at the scene. Smith left the Ravens’ hotel about 2 a.m. and raced home to grieve with his family. About 12 hours later, after barely sleeping, he rejoined his teammates. Kevin Glover, the longtime N.F.L. center who became a confidant of Smith’s while working in Maryland’s athletic department, attended the funeral. There, Smith presented his family with two footballs, from his touchdown catches against the Patriots.That he had the courage to play — and the focus to play well — did not surprise those who know Smith best, those who know the details of a turbulent childhood that left him caring for his six younger siblings.“He is so mentally tough, and I imagine it’s because he’s had to compartmentalize his entire life,” said Vanderbilt Coach James Franklin, who was Smith’s offensive coordinator at Maryland for three seasons. “He’s used that energy and passion and emotion for his benefit.”From an early age, Smith did his siblings’ laundry. He changed their diapers. He fed them; his proficiency in the kitchen earned him the nickname the Microwave King, from his mother, Monica Jenkins. She worked two jobs, and for a while she was involved in an abusive relationship with a man who was not Smith’s father.That humble upbringing produced a young man with no ego, said friends and coaches. Roger Pierce, Smith’s coach for three years at Stafford High School in Virginia, remembers the day Tom Brattan, a coach at Maryland at the time, came to visit, and Smith transported a special-needs student down a congested hallway.“That’s just who Torrey is,” Pierce said. “Always responsible for other people.”At Maryland, Smith shuttled between campus and his family whenever time allowed. He never missed class, practice, a team function. Once, he asked Dwight Galt, the strength and conditioning coach, who was then unaware of Smith’s family circumstances, if he could work out early on Fridays so he could go home. Told no, Smith lifted with his group, then bolted to Virginia.“It went on like this for about a year before he finally told me that he was going there to help out his brothers and sisters,” Galt said. “He wasn’t embarrassed by anything. It was that it was part of his life, and he took care of it like he takes care of everything.”When asked whether he has always considered football an escape, Smith spoke specifically about his brother’s death. He called escape a weird term.“I feel like these guys are my brothers,” he said. “I’m in here the same as when I was home. Even after my brother passed, I left home and came up here and the love was still the same.”Players speak about the team’s closeness, forged by leaders like Ray Lewis and Ed Reed and Matt Birk, by coaches who say, “iron sharpens iron.” They protect their own, which might be why Smith — and Boldin, for that matter — fits in so well. Boldin arrived in a trade with Arizona in March 2010. The deal did more than furnish Joe Flacco with a No. 1 receiver. It added one of the toughest players in the sport.Boldin, 32, grew up in Pahokee, a South Florida town afflicted by unemployment and poverty but a place where, Ravens defensive end Pernell McPhee said, “you come out of the womb ready to play football.” Boldin’s parents divorced when he was 9, and his mother, Brenda Banks, worked late hours, including as a day care teacher in West Palm Beach, an hour’s drive away. He saw football as a means to leave Pahokee, but he returns often, to donate turkeys or outfit a team with new equipment.“He uses football to express his anger,” said D. J. Boldin, his younger brother. “When he’s on the field, he just has that dominant spirit.”Had it at Pahokee High School, where an assistant coach, Blaze Thompson, recalled Boldin’s running into a pile of five or so defenders and coming out the other end, “just dragging guys.” Had it at Florida State, where he began a stellar career by scoring two touchdowns in his first game. Has it in the N.F.L., where few are better, Hostler said, at catching contested balls.“If you continue to come at a guy during a game, mentally he’s going to break down,” said the longtime N.F.L. receiver Derrick Mason, who played with Baltimore in 2010. “Anquan uses that to his advantage — his big body, his physical presence, not giving up. Guys get tired covering him.”One play has come to define his toughness. On Sept. 28, 2008, when Boldin was playing for the Arizona Cardinals, Eric Smith of the Jets drilled him with a helmet-to-helmet hit. Boldin’s head snapped back. His body crashed to the turf. His sinus membrane was fractured, requiring 7 plates and 40 screws to fix. Boldin came back a month later, missing only two games. D. J. was in the stands for his brother’s return, at Carolina. On the Cardinals’ first drive, Boldin gained 30 yards on an end-around. Rather than veer out of bounds to avoid contact, Boldin lowered his shoulder and drove into the defender.“I was like, ‘He just broke his face,’ ” said D. J., his voice rising. “He didn’t just come back. He came back fearless.”In that area, Boldin and Smith have much experience. Jacoby Jones calls Boldin “Quan the Bully” because of his physical, unyielding style. Smith recently printed for his teammates purple T-shirts that read, “FINAO — Failure Is Not an Option.” It is not. Not for either of them. Not for both of them."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/sports/golf/roberto-castro-taps-family-tree-of-fairways-and-greens.html,"LA QUINTA, Calif. — Two months after his 10th birthday, Roberto Castro traveled with his maternal grandparents to watch his aunt, Jenny Lidback, compete in the 1995 du Maurier Classic in Quebec. After Lidback secured a one-stroke victory, she made a detour on her way to sign her scorecard to deliver her golf ball to her nephew.A few hours later, in the middle of a celebratory dinner for Lidback’s first LPGA Tour title, in what was then a major, Castro gave the ball back. It was snuggled in a wooden box that Castro bought with $20 he borrowed from his grandfather while his aunt was fulfilling her post-victory commitments.Almost 18 years later, the wooden box, affixed with the Beaconsfield Golf Club insignia, is arranged so it grabs Lidback’s attention when she walks into her trophy room. And her nephew, now grown, has caught the eye of the golfing world by placing himself in contention for his first PGA Tour victory, at the Humana Challenge.Castro, 27, carded a three-under-par 69 at La Quinta Country Club on Saturday for a 54-hole total of 17-under. He is tied for second with four players, five strokes behind Scott Stallings, who posted a nine-under 63 at the Nicklaus course at PGA West.“A five-shot lead seems like a big deal,” Castro said. “Then on Sunday nights, sometimes nobody remembers who was leading by five depending upon how Sunday goes.”Uphill battles do not seem to bother Castro. From watching Lidback, he learned that the prize doesn’t always go to the top prospect, but to the one who perseveres.“Golf is hard, you know, so I think that that was the biggest lesson I learned,” Castro said. “That the game beats you up, and you just kind of got to keep on plugging away.”Like his aunt, who won eight times on the Futures tour before gaining her L.P.G.A. playing privileges, Castro did not make it to the top tour on his first try. Since earning a degree in industrial engineering at Georgia Tech, he has been a professional for seven years. He spent the first five competing on the Canadian, Hooters, eGolf and Web.com tours. Last year, his first full season on the PGA Tour, he finished 77th in the FedEx Cup standings and had one top-10 finish.“I’ve told Roberto, golf is not like engineering,” Lidback said Saturday in a telephone interview. “In school, you study and you make an A. In golf, you can practice your heart out and sometimes you don’t see the results for a while.”She added, “I wasn’t the most talented golfer, but I was a really hard worker, and that’s what I see in him.”Castro’s mother, Annie, is Lidback’s sister, but she also has two brothers who competed on the golf team at Louisiana State. Annie was the only one in the family who did not play golf, but all three of her sons gravitated to the game. Castro has one younger brother who played at Georgia State and another who is a junior at North Carolina-Charlotte.“The poor thing,” Lidback said, referring to her sister. “I call her the most knowledgeable nongolfer in the world. The poor thing had to sit through dinner after dinner after dinner listening to golf stories.”Not to mention year after year after year of chauffeuring her sons to tournaments. “My mom knows a lot about the game,” Castro said, “but she has no patience. Obviously, golf’s not a good game for her.”For the finer points of the game, Castro can go to Lidback.What did he learn from her? Where does Castro start?He said: “I just learned from her that good golfers, professional golfers, shoot 80. That was the difference growing up. I saw a lot of my peers in junior golf and college golf, they’d freak out when they’d shoot 78 or shoot 80. But having her perspective, it’s like she knows that even the best players in the world struggle. So a couple bad tournaments or a bad round, I wasn’t getting phone calls from my parents or my aunt.”In 2007, shortly after he turned pro, Castro played a Canadian tour event a few miles from the site of Lidback’s triumph. One day after a practice round, Castro drove to the course in Pointe-Claire, outside Montreal, and explained to the guards at the gate that his aunt had won a tournament there. They let him in and he made a nostalgic tour of the grounds. On Sunday, he’ll try to turn another final round into a lifelong memory."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/sports/baseball/baseball-set-to-allow-interpreters-on-pitching-mound.html,"Major League Baseball’s new proposal to allow interpreters to accompany coaches to the mound is not unprecedented. Interpreters in Japan and South Korea have long participated in mound conferences with pitchers who do not speak the same language as their managers or coaches.But the presence of a multilingual facilitator does not always eliminate communication problems.When C. J. Nitkowski was pitching in Japan for the Fukuoka SoftBank Hawks in 2008, the team’s interpreter would visit the mound with the manager, Sadaharu Oh, or the demanding pitching coach, Tadashi Sugimoto. On one occasion, the interpreter dutifully relayed the following intricate instructions from Sugimoto:“Pitching coach said it would be good if you could pitch perfect now,” Nitkowski recalled the interpreter saying. He added that he was so exasperated by the unhelpful suggestion that he could barely contain himself.“I told him, ‘If I could pitch perfectly, I wouldn’t be in Japan right now,’ ” Nitkowski said.It is unclear whether Nitkowski’s retort was accurately relayed to Sugimoto.Having an outsider on the mound in the heat of competition was an often awkward and weird dynamic, Nitkowski said. But in the United States, where most Asian pitchers do not go through minor league systems and often have little command of English, communication problems are not infrequent. So 19 years after the groundbreaking arrival of Hideo Nomo from Japan, Major League Baseball is set to adopt a rule that will allow interpreters to accompany the manager or the pitching coach to speak to a foreign-born pitcher.The new rule, first reported by ESPN.com, is one of many expected to be ratified by the players association before the 2013 regular season. It would even the field for players who do not speak English fluently. After all, nothing in the rule book establishes English as the league’s official language.Two Major League Baseball officials said interpreters would be permitted for not only Japanese, South Korean and Taiwanese pitchers, but also speakers of Spanish, Dutch and Italian.“I think it’s a great idea,” said Yoichi Terada, the former interpreter for Hisanori Takahashi, a veteran Japanese left-hander with the Mets, the Angels and the Pirates. “Managers and coaches try to use easy words, but most of the Japanese players don’t understand every word they said on the mound.”Still, pitchers often nod as if they do.In September 2004, Jae Weong Seo, then pitching for the Mets, was about to face Atlanta’s Chipper Jones with a runner on second base. Rick Peterson, then the Mets’ pitching coach, jogged to the mound to give Seo simple and specific instructions on pitching to Jones. Peterson had a list of statistics to back up the tactics but did not bother describing them at the time. He just told Seo not to throw a strike under any circumstances.Seo, a right-hander from South Korea, nodded several times and said, “O.K.,” Peterson recalled.But Peterson had barely returned to the dugout when Seo delivered a juicy strike to Jones, who drilled the ball off the wall in center field for a double. Peterson looked at anyone who would listen and said, “You know, I don’t think he understood a word I said.”Seo had been in the United States more than four years at that point and probably had understood Peterson’s rudimentary instructions, but with some uncertainty. A great deal of nodding from a pitcher might lead some to suspect that he is not grasping the information.“It’s universal,” said Pittsburgh’s Russell Martin, who caught the Japanese pitcher Hiroki Kuroda with the Dodgers and the Yankees. “They nod and say yes to everything you’re saying.”After one training camp, most foreign-born pitchers have command of enough English baseball terminology to understand the basic directives of their pitching coach and catcher. When he was with the Mets, Takahashi knew to listen for “down and away” from the pitching coach Dan Warthen.But when a pitcher has no idea what his coach is trying to convey, perhaps he nods as if he knows what is going on, just to be polite.“Oh, sure, that happens all the time,” said Kenji Nimura, the former interpreter for Kuroda. “That’s pretty much what’s going on out there.”But the good pitchers, like Kuroda, usually know what they are doing anyway, and the mound conference is a way to give him a breather, or buy time for the next pitcher to warm up.When Nomo came to the United States from Japan in 1994 to pitch for the Dodgers, he spoke almost no English. But Tommy Lasorda, their manager at the time, said he never had a problem communicating on the mound without an interpreter.“I don’t know if he understood us or not,” Lasorda said, “but usually he got the guy out.”In most cases, the only time interpreters are not with pitchers is on the mound. But during a scouting meeting, in the trainers’ room, warming up in the bullpen or on the team bus, the interpreter is at the pitcher’s side, translating everything said. That was the case with Kazuhisa Ishii when pitched for the Mets in 2005. But when he got to the mound, communication broke down.“It was always a struggle with Ishii,” Peterson said.To facilitate communication with all of his Asian pitchers, Peterson would print a small card with the translations for certain instructions, and when he got to the mound, he would point to the appropriate one. But on several occasions Ishii failed to follow strict instructions not to throw his breaking ball in certain situations. Finally, during one game in which Ishii threw a breaking ball at the wrong time, Peterson turned to the interpreter on the bench and said, “If he throws one more curveball when he’s behind in the count, I’m going to kick your butt.”In that case, no translation was necessary."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/sports/football/nfc-49ers-colin-kaepernick-takes-nevada-offense-to-big-stage.html,"RENO, Nev. — San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick faked the inside handoff, then jetted off right tackle, up an alley and into the end zone, 56 yards, untouched. Chris Ault watched that play, produced by both his protégé and his offense last weekend against the Green Bay Packers, from his living room.“That’s Samurai,” he told his guests.Samurai was Kaepernick’s favorite play in college at Nevada, where Ault coached until he resigned last month. Ault’s tenure there is defined by the offense he created, the Pistol, an innovation that changed college football and this season became the new rage in the N.F.L.On Thursday, Ault, 66, retreated to a back room at the local restaurant Napa-Sonoma, where he spread a half-dozen salt and pepper shakers across the table, into formation. His food sat nearby, uneaten.He pointed at one salt shaker, the quarterback, who must first read the left defensive end as one pepper shaker, known as the alley guy, slides in motion to the right. Should the end pinch inward, the quarterback must fake the inside handoff and follow the alley guy off right tackle, into the alley, as Kaepernick did against the Packers. Should the end remain outside the tackle, the quarterback must hand the ball off. “Ride and decide,” they called it.This is the Pistol, an offense defined by options and misdirection, at its finest. An offense that could again power the 49ers in the N.F.C. championship game Sunday against Atlanta, with a berth in the Super Bowl at stake.“I can’t tell you how many touchdowns we scored with Samurai,” Ault said. “Too many to count. People called me all week, ‘Coach, remember when he did that against Fresno?’ ”Ever since Kaepernick rushed for 181 yards against the Packers, an N.F.L. record for a quarterback, Ault had spent more than three hours each day talking about his offense and the quarterback who sped forward its evolution. Ault heard from former players and assistants, from locals and friends and reporters, from what seemed like every person he ever met.He told them all about the Pistol and about Kaepernick, the perfect marriage, Ault repeated, between system and skills.The system was born after Ault returned to the sidelines in 2004 and Nevada stumbled to a 5-7 record. Ault wanted to reinvent his offense and himself. Every day for three months, he scribbled notes, watched tape and studied other teams, including an innovative coach at New Hampshire named Chip Kelly.Ault wanted his quarterback to take snaps almost exclusively from the shotgun formation, just as Kelly’s did. Except Ault wanted his running back behind the quarterback, not beside him.One afternoon, Ault and an assistant went down to the locker room, where they used white tape and a rolled-up towel to design the Pistol. Ault was technically the system’s first quarterback. Two yards behind center felt too short. Five yards felt too long. Four yards, shorter than the shotgun but with many of the benefits, seemed perfect.Ault named his makeshift offense the Pistol, because it was shorter than the shotgun. “I needed to put our stamp on Nevada football,” he said. “So I made a stand.”His offense consisted of five basic plays, each with dozens of variations and endless combinations of personnel. The alley guy could be a tight end, a fullback, an H-back or a slot receiver. Different versions of each play used three receivers, or two tight ends. Imagine an ice cream shop with 5 flavors and 55 or 85 sundae combinations. That was the Pistol offense.Ault started as a high school coach, and his creation incorporated many of the misdirection principles from his first offense, the Wing-T. Those who characterized the Pistol as a passing offense, or an option offense, were misguided. Ault wanted to run. And he wanted to run straight ahead.The Pistol allowed a coordinator to utilize any type of run game, whether power, zone, counter or stretch. It also placed the running back deeper behind the line of scrimmage, which allowed him to gather steam as he approached the hole and gave him room to cut back, too.Near the end of the 2005 season, Nevada upset Fresno State and captured a share of the Western Athletic Conference championship. No one at Nevada thought to trademark this new offense, no Pistol T-shirts, no hats, no key chains.“We had a signature,” Ault said. “We had a brand. We were the Pistol offense, and we missed a golden opportunity.”Kaepernick arrived in 2007, after he declined a career in professional baseball and accepted the only football scholarship he was offered. He picked up the offense quickly and ran like a gazelle but threw the ball sidearm, his motion ugly and awkward. He studied clips of mobile quarterbacks like Donovan McNabb, Michael Vick and Randall Cunningham. But he longed to display a more balanced set of skills.“I feel like my whole life I’ve been categorized as a runner,” Kaepernick said last week.Ault drilled his pupil on shifting his release point, made Kaepernick toss hundreds of footballs over the goal posts to force his arm to extend. Kaepernick stepped in for an injured starter, as he would do in San Francisco. In 2009, Nevada became the first team in N.C.A.A. history with three 1,000-yard rushers. Kaepernick threw for more than 10,000 yards and rushed for more than 4,000.“By then, I hoped nobody else would adopt the Pistol,” Ault said. “It was my baby.”Coaches began to arrive here anyway. They came from high schools, from junior colleges, from major universities, even from Canada. Representatives from 44 teams visited last spring alone. Ault shared his offense with every one of them.He saw Louisiana State run the Pistol in the national championship game it won after the 2007 season. He watched as the offense, his offense, became prevalent throughout college football, spreading from coast to coast.Ault never expected the concept to bleed into the N.F.L., at least until he watched the Washington Redskins early this season. There went Robert Griffin III in the Pistol, his offense, running something similar to Samurai. The Redskins lined their alley guy up closer to the quarterback, but the idea remained the same. Washington made the playoffs for the first time since 1997.This did not seem to surprise Trent Dilfer, a retired quarterback turned ESPN analyst. “I remember making a statement, off the cuff, that this would be the next big thing,” he said. “Here you’ve got all the biggest, baddest dudes playing quarterback, and once that happened, the game had to adjust.”Dilfer viewed the Pistol as the perfect bridge offense for young quarterbacks, an easier way to transition from college into the N.F.L. Kaepernick, for instance, came to the 49ers, Dilfer said, with “a graduate-level degree in one area of quarterbacking.”“He knows the zone read better than his coaches,” Dilfer said.The offense also marked the perfect home for a mobile quarterback, someone like Dilfer’s ESPN colleague Steve Young.The 49ers selected Kaepernick in the second round in 2011, behind a list of quarterbacks that included Cam Newton, Jake Locker, Blaine Gabbert, Christian Ponder and Andy Dalton. Harbaugh had attended Nevada’s pro day, worked out Kaepernick himself, even had Kaepernick throw into the wind.Harbaugh’s offensive coordinator, Greg Roman, had visited Nevada when Roman worked for Harbaugh at Stanford, to glean insight into Ault’s offense. Roman said last week that he “loved the concept,” but neither he nor Harbaugh told Ault they planned to use it in San Francisco.Some aspects of the offense confused even the 49ers. Frank Gore did not like the offense at first, saying it was not real football. He said he first noticed the Pistol at Oregon, where Kelly’s quarterbacks operated from the shotgun, a major difference. Tight end Delanie Walker said the N.F.L. would “evolve into the read-option pretty soon.” Nose tackle Ricky Jean-Francois called it a phase.Dilfer, as adept at X’s and O’s as any analyst in football, said he expected teams with mobile quarterbacks to feature the Pistol in up to 30 percent of their base offense, a high percentage for any one concept. He said the Pistol allowed for better footwork for quarterbacks than the shotgun. He said it aided offensive timing and would have a greater effect in future seasons when teams started to further incorporate the play-action pass.The near future of the N.F.L., Dilfer continued, would feature two schools of thought on quarterback play, professional football’s version of Republicans and Democrats.“You’re going to have your traditional quarterbacks,” he said. “And you’re to have another generation of quarterbacks that can do all the passing things and bring another dimension. I’m not talking about scramblers. I’m talking about a quarterback-driven run game. Like the Pistol.”The offense’s obvious drawback, that it can put a mobile quarterback in harm’s way, can be mitigated by play-calling, Ault said. Instead of calling a run play for a quarterback 15 times a game the way Nevada did, an N.F.L. coordinator would dial up more like five runs. Of course, tell that to the Redskins, who saw Griffin limp his way through a playoff loss.“The Pistol is here to stay,” Ault said. “It’s not like the wishbone. You’ll still have guys like Andrew Luck who can drop back, throw the thing, sit in the pocket. But I’m going to tell you, he could run the Pistol. He’d be great in the Pistol. So would Aaron Rodgers.”After lunch, Ault drove to Mackay Stadium and reminisced. He talked about one run against Fresno, in Kaepernick’s senior season, when Kaepernick felt the blitz, evaded it and chugged down the left sideline before he vaulted from the 3-yard line into the end zone — “the best run I’ve seen in 28 years of coaching,” Ault said. He talked about the pass Kaepernick threw, on the run, 55 yards downfield, that hit his tight end in the face mask.“Every time he touched the ball, whether he gained yardage or not, you could just feel the electricity,” Ault said. “Especially when we called Samurai. When he got outside the tackle, with those long, loping legs of his, well, they haven’t caught him yet.”When Ault stepped down after Nevada’s bowl loss this season, after too many games in which the Pistol helped the Wolf Pack gain 500-plus yards and score 50-plus points and Nevada still won or lost by single digits, he was careful not to use the word “retired.” In recent weeks, a few N.F.L. teams called. Kelly, meanwhile, left Oregon for the Philadelphia Eagles.For the Pistol, an offense that started with white tape and a gray-haired quarterback in the Nevada locker room, the possibilities now seem endless — for Ault, for Kaepernick, for Harbaugh, from Washington to San Francisco.N.F.L., meet Samurai."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/sports/football/asante-samuel-keeping-the-falcons-laughing-and-learning.html,"FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. — In addition to being a cornerback for the Atlanta Falcons, Asante Samuel considers himself — at least according to the biography on his Twitter page — a “C.E.O. of many things.” Included in that list, it seems, is being the chief critic of the Falcons’ offensive game plan.By now, the scene is comically familiar to Samuel’s teammates: at some point during practice, the Falcons’ up-tempo offense will try to run a passing play in Samuel’s direction. Samuel will break it up. Then, as the players are returning to the huddle, Samuel will begin shrieking in the direction of the offensive coordinator Dirk Koetter.“He’ll be like, ‘Take that out the playbook, Dirk!’ ” Thomas DeCoud, another Falcons cornerback, said, laughing. “Then he’ll be like, ‘I don’t like that one, Dirk! Come up with something else!’ ”DeCoud added: “He’s like the judge and jury of the offense. We all love to watch it. It’s pretty much the best part of my day and reason why I like coming to work.”DeCoud added that part of Samuel’s appeal was his boisterous nature, and indeed, in the tiny locker room at the Falcons’ training center here, Samuel is often heard before he is seen. One day last week, as the Falcons prepared for Sunday’s N.F.C. championship game against San Francisco, Samuel’s blustery banter preceded him around a corner before he addressed a group of reporters. After a few minutes, he announced that he would take one more question, then smiled when he was asked about the Falcons’ defensive strategy against the 49ers.“Hit ’em in the mouth and hit ’em hard!” he replied in a singsong voice before bouncing away.Later, in a quiet moment at his locker, Samuel reflected on his 10-year career, which included five seasons with New England and four with Philadelphia before he was traded to the Falcons last year. His departure from the Eagles was acrimonious after they obtained Nnamdi Asomugha and Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie to play ahead of him, and he arrived in Atlanta with a reputation as something of a malcontent. Several of his current teammates say that perception was shocking to them because Samuel immediately fell into a role with the Falcons as a voice of experience, if not continual humor.“I feel comfortable here because I feel appreciated,” Samuel said. “I love playing where people appreciate who I am and what I can do.”Samuel’s on-field ability is obvious; he had 19 passes defended and 5 interceptions this season, including one that he returned for a touchdown. Even at 32, he still has the speed and agility to keep up with top receivers, and his teammates say his focus and preparation remain intense. In film sessions, he often counsels younger players on how to handle certain situations, his teammates said.On Sunday, when the Falcons will attempt to slow the explosive 49ers offense, Samuel will probably be asked to spend much of the game trying to contain Michael Crabtree, who had 119 receiving yards and 2 touchdowns in last week’s win over Green Bay.Crabtree has emerged as the 49ers’ top threat, scoring five touchdowns in the final five games of the regular season. Still, Samuel seemed unbowed. “It’s going to be work, but I don’t back down from anything,” he said.Important as Samuel’s cover skills are, his value to the Falcons also lies in his intangibles because he is one of the few players on the team with postseason experience. Last week’s victory over Seattle was the first career playoff win for Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan, Coach Mike Smith and tight end Tony Gonzalez; by comparison, it was Samuel’s 11th playoff victory. He won a Super Bowl with the Patriots in 2004.“I can talk to guys about what it means to be in these games, what kind of mistakes can burn you,” Samuel said. “I can also keep everyone in the right frame of mind. There’s a certain way to approach this time of year that can help keep you straight.”That, as much as anything, is part of Samuel’s importance. He chirps and guffaws in the locker room. He gives teammates nicknames, several of which, for whatever reason, appear to be related to being slick. Ryan, for example, is Matty Ice to most others but is Matty Black Ice to Samuel “because he is real slick.” Charles Mitchell, a rookie safety, is known as Mitch Slick. Then there are the nicknames, according to cornerback Robert McClain, that might not be printable in the newspaper.Samuel also helps build the chemistry among the team’s defensive backs. Each week during the season, DeCoud said, the group met on Thursday nights at an area sports bar to watch football together, and Samuel was an integral part of the so-called “D. B. tabernacle,” as the players refer to their get-togethers.“He’s an entertaining guy,” linebacker Sean Weatherspoon said. “I think we’d all heard things, but he’s really just positive. He’s himself. He doesn’t put on anything, he doesn’t try to do anything. He’s ended up being a really important part of what we do.”Samuel hesitated for a moment when asked if he has always been this way, before conceding that it was a product of his upbringing. Samuel was born in Accra, Ghana, but grew up in South Florida, where he credited his mother, Christine, for giving him his edge.“I think a lot of my personality is from my mother,” said Samuel, who is still dealing with the emotional effect of his mother’s death in early January. “She was my inspiration. She was my hero.”In the buildup to Sunday’s game, Samuel has maintained his now-familiar posture. He spoke often about the team’s confidence despite being underdogs at home to the 49ers. He also did not let up on Koetter, even as the coordinator toiled over an important game plan.Some might give Koetter a break at such a high-stress time of the season. But that is not Samuel’s way. At one point early Thursday afternoon, Samuel saw Koetter darting through the locker room and immediately popped up from his chair.“Hey, Dirk! Why you wearing shorts, Dirk? You never wear shorts, Dirk!” he shouted as Koetter whizzed past. Samuel laughed. “What’s the matter, Dirk?” he called after Koetter’s back. “Are you nervous?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/sports/football/cornerback-aqib-talib-finds-a-home-with-the-patriots.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — The Kansas football program had something called Aqib Rules, and they were simple: when Aqib Talib, their highly regarded cornerback, did something stupid — a not infrequent occurrence early on in an all-American career — his teammates could put a free body shot on him.Talib’s transgressions were the kind that Mark Mangino, the former Kansas coach, described as common among young college players: fighting, defiance, bad attitude. But his troubles reappeared after he was drafted in the first round by the Tampa Bay Bucanneers in 2008, and body shots are not part of the N.F.L. arsenal for controlling them. There were more fights, including one with a teammate at the rookie symposium and an assault on a cabdriver, as well as a charge of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon that was later dropped and league suspensions. So when Talib was traded from Tampa Bay to New England in November, Mangino had words of advice for the player who still calls him “my dog.”“I told him this is a fresh start with new people; make a great impression,” Mangino said last week in a telephone interview. “He’ll work. Practice for him was fun. He told me he was excited to go there because they win. But he knew they have a system there. They’re very structured. They play very intelligent football. I just told him: work hard and lay low. When you’re not at work or in meetings, just lay low and relax.”Few players this season took better advantage of a fresh start. With his contract set to expire after this season and his welcome with Buccaneers fans worn out long ago, Talib made a soft landing in New England, where he immediately helped stabilize a shaky secondary when he took the field with the Patriots for the first time in mid-November. Coaches who have known Talib since he was a junior in high school see him as a high-spirited, well-liked teammate, one with, as the Jayhawks assistant Clint Bowen put it, a “contagious personality — good, bad or indifferent.”“When there is excitement to be had, he’ll be in the middle of it,” Bowen said. “He’s had a hard time avoiding that.”Talib’s enthusiasm runs so high and he speaks so fast that Mangino says he understands only about 50 percent of what Talib says on the phone. But Bowen and Mangino also say Talib does better in a structured environment. Talib buckled down in his final years at Kansas after Mangino told him that if he did not, he might have to find someplace else to go. He emerged as a strong leader who, Mangino used to joke in staff meetings, was like a whip, able to get everybody where they were supposed to be.But Talib seemed to regress in the N.F.L. When Greg Schaino took over as Tampa Bay’s coach last January, he took him under his wing. Mangino visited the Buccaneers during training camp and was told by assistants that Talib was doing well. Then Talib tested positive for what he said was the stimulant Adderall. When the Patriots sent a fourth-round draft pick to Tampa Bay for Talib, it seemed a high price to pay for a short-term rental of a trouble-prone talent.But Patriots Coach Bill Belichick, a close friend of Schiano’s, has experience with slipping high-maintenance players into his button-down locker room. Randy Moss and Corey Dillon thrived in New England, at least for a while. And Talib, to hear Mangino tell it, fits the profile of a player Belichick prefers: intelligent and with a deep understanding and love of football. Bowen said Talib would pretend not to pay attention in secondary meetings at Kansas, then laugh when the safeties did not know the answers to questions.“He’s dumb like a fox,” Bowen said. “He’ll play that street thing.” He continued: “But don’t let him fool you. That cat is highly intelligent.”At 6 feet 2 inches, Talib is tall enough to play the ball at its highest point. But what enables him to cover the best receivers, aside from his physical gifts, are his instincts, anticipation and knowledge of the game.With the Baltimore Ravens and the deep-ball offense that shattered the Denver Broncos last week on tap for the A.F.C. championship game Sunday, Talib is suddenly at the heart of the Patriots’ hopes for reaching another Super Bowl. Talib said he watched as Denver cornerback Champ Bailey, one of his favorite players, was beaten twice for touchdowns by Torrey Smith in the first half last week, wondering, “Come on, Champ, what’s going on?”The Patriots believe Talib is capable of helping them avoid Denver’s fate.“Anytime you can basically say, ‘Hey, you got this guy, and we are going to cover everybody else,’ that is a good sign,” defensive tackle Vince Wilfork said.Last week, Talib was largely responsible for covering Houston’s Andre Johnson. According to the Web site Pro Football Focus, Talib was thrown at nine times and allowed six receptions. But the longest pass completed on him was 16 yards, and he allowed just 8 yards after the catches.Talib has had a broader effect on the defense, too, because he enabled the Patriots to keep Devin McCourty at safety, where they can best take advantage of his range. In the first 10 games of the regular season — before the trade and the completion of Talib’s four-game suspension for testing positive for a performance-enhancing drug — the Patriots allowed third-down conversions at a rate of 43 percent and an average of 22.5 points a game. Those figures fell to 30.4 percent and 17.6 points in the last six games.The Patriots have been less susceptible to big plays, too. According to figures compiled by The Boston Globe, they have allowed just one completion of 40 yards or longer since Talib arrived, and that was on a screen pass. In the first 10 games, The Globe said, they allowed seven pass plays of at least 40 yards. The Patriots are also allowing fewer passes of at least 20 yards — 3.3 a game, down from 4.7.Last week, as the Patriots prepared for a game that has now become nearly routine for them, Talib was the smiling, if careful, newcomer. He has avoided comparing New England with Tampa Bay. But when asked how a player whom Bowen likened to a thoroughbred — jumping around and sometimes hard to handle — could fit so smoothly into the N.F.L.’ s most regimented team, Talib responded: “The guys definitely welcomed me and treat me like I’m part of the family. They’re straight about the business around here. You’re definitely going to play some real football around here.”Talib will be a free agent after the season, and the adjustments he has made with the Patriots may make him more attractive to other teams. Belichick spoke highly of Talib last week, saying he has had a “very positive” effect and noting his “professionalism.”“I like him,” Belichick said. “The team likes him.”The last time Bowen watched Talib during pregame introductions, Talib chose to announce his school affiliation as Berkner High School and Bowen jokes that if Talib doesn’t say Kansas next time, Bowen wants to deliver some of the body shots that the Jayhawks used to keep Talib in line. Belichick’s praise seems a long way from there.“I’ve just been living one day at a time for as long as I can remember,” Talib said. “I never worried. I am only 26 years old. I never thought, Oh man, my career is over. I didn’t do nothing that bad, now.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/sports/tennis/tennis-trying-a-no-let-experiment-on-serves.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Once again, a debate has emerged in tennis on whether to do away with the do-overs.The ATP announced in September that the let rule — which requires that a serve be redone if the ball clips the net before landing in the service box — would be removed on a trial for three months in the Challenger Tour, the level one step below the ATP World Tour. Total purses at Challenger tournaments range from $35,000 to $125,000.The experiment was announced along with adjustments toward more strict enforcement of the rule regulating the number of seconds players take between points, suggesting that both measures were being considered as a way to shorten matches.“Although this change will not materially reduce the length of a match, we believe it should have a positive impact on the flow of the match,” said Brad Drewett, then the ATP’s executive chairman and president. “We’re certainly not ready yet to eliminate the service let, but believe a trial at the ATP Challenger level will be a good way to test this initiative in a competitive environment and get feedback from players and the public before deciding if it could be adapted more broadly.”The no-let rule is in place in men’s collegiate tennis and World Team Tennis, the summer league founded by Billie Jean King, who has said that removing the lets “just makes for more drama.”The no-let rule may be in place for drama in World Team Tennis, but in men’s college tennis, where players often make their own line calls, it was meant to stop them from making phantom let calls on serves they cannot return.Steve Johnson, a two-time N.C.A.A. men’s singles champion from the University of Southern California who now plays professionally, said, “In college, it’s more an anticheating thing, rather than ‘I think this might be better for the game; it might speed it up.’ ”During a previous consideration of the rule in the 1990s, the International Tennis Federation conducted a two-year study of some 715 matches, finding that there were an average of 4.1 lets a match, and that in 65 percent of the cases the result of the let did not favor one player more than the other. A majority of serves that clip the net but land in continue to move with roughly the same trajectory and speed; balls that drastically change speed or direction are less frequent.“I mean that’s the thing, maybe once, twice, not that many,” Johnson said of the number of service lets that changed crucial points in his four-year college career. “Not like a dozen. Maybe like one or two. It doesn’t really change the outcome that much.”The qualifying draw for the Australian Open included several players who had experienced the no-let rule in a $75,000 Challenger event in Nouméa, New Caledonia.Adrian Mannarino, who won that tournament, favored the rule.“It was tough in the beginning, for sure, because we are not used to play with it,” he said. “And even if we are playing some practicing sets before, it was tough, because we are always stopping the ball or not playing it. But after a couple of matches, I was getting used to it. And actually from the semifinal, I was playing like it was normal. So it was good.”Mannarino added that the fans especially enjoyed seeing the players cope with the no-let rule.“I think it’s much more funny for the crowd than a bad thing for the players,” he said.Conversely, Florent Serra, who was seeded second in Nouméa but lost in the first round, said he was not pleased with the rule.“We don’t earn time because I think there is six or seven lets during a match,” he said. “They said they put it for the spectators, for the show. But it’s not very spectacular. For me, it doesn’t have any sense.”Mannarino acknowledged that his opinion would not mean much.“I think it should be the main events who would try it, not the Challenger,” he said. “Because we are not going to decide about it.”Peter Polansky, who lost in the second round in Nouméa, said: “I mean, it’s a little bit unfair for the Challenger players — we’re kind of like the lab rats. But it’s tough to implement something right away on the ATP level.”Polansky became accustomed to playing without lets. “It keeps the players on their toes,” he said, “and a lot of players agreed with me that they liked it; they enjoyed it. And it made things a bit more interesting.”Sam Groth said he worried that the rule might somewhat neutralize his blazing serve.“With the net strung so tightly, especially at hardcourt tournaments, it doesn’t really favor the server,” Groth said. “I feel like generally, if it pops up, it will favor the returner a little bit, which for me as a big server is not something I’m a massive fan of.”Groth added that lower levels of net tension on grass and indoor courts would make the ball more likely to dribble over.“I’m probably not a fan of it,” he said. “But as a player, you go out on court and you play with what you have to play with, and deal with whatever it is on any given day.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/football/threat-of-colin-kaepernick-running-spurs-49ers-comeback.html,"ATLANTA — Colin Kaepernick toppled the Atlanta Falcons and wowed a national television audience and boosted the San Francisco 49ers back into the Super Bowl as a quarterback. Not as a mobile quarterback, a running quarterback, an athletic quarterback, or a Pistol offense quarterback.As a quarterback, period.Kaepernick again shredded those misperceptions at the Georgia Dome on Sunday, again proved more than a runner who happens to throw the football on occasion. When he ran, it was onto the field, or back toward the sideline, or away from defenders.One week after he set an N.F.L. quarterback record with 181 rushing yards against Green Bay, Kaepernick carried twice for 21 yards — and one of those rushes was actually a scramble. He did beat the Falcons with his legs, but not the way everyone expected.It was not the run but the threat to run that made the difference.The threat to run fueled the 49ers’ comeback in their 28-24 victory. It left vulnerable the middle of the Falcons’ defense, opened holes wide enough for a family of elephants to lumber through. It allowed Frank Gore to gash Atlanta for 90 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns. It opened up the play-action pass, which meant Kaepernick unleashed tight end Vernon Davis, which meant the Falcons grew dizzy trying to figure out which part of the field to defend.That is the beauty of Kaepernick and this 49ers’ offense under the coordinator Greg Roman: the myriad ways that it can move the ball and score. That is why San Francisco is back in the Super Bowl, because Coach Jim Harbaugh made the midseason change to Kaepernick and continued to add wrinkle upon wrinkle to an offense as unpredictable as any in the N.F.L.The last two weeks underscored that notion. Against the Packers, Kaepernick looked like an improved version of Fran Tarkenton as he scrambled this way and that. Against the Falcons, he played the role of prototypical passer, all drop-backs and handoffs and throws downfield.Afterward, Kaepernick tugged an N.F.C. championship T-shirt over his shoulder pads and conducted his news conference with his play-call sheet still on his wrist, the black stripes still underneath his eyes. Reporters continued to press with the same question they have asked since he first started in Week 11 against Chicago. Was he worried?Sunday marked his ninth start in professional football. Think about that. Kaepernick watched an entire game from the bench as late as late October. But worried? No, he was not.Gore entered the room while Kaepernick dismissed any concerns over the 17-0 deficit the 49ers faced early. Gore embraced his quarterback and pulled him close, both men still in pads.“He can do whatever,” Gore told reporters, unprompted, with his arm still around Kaepernick. “He can throw the ball. He can run the ball. He’s a football player. If it wasn’t for him, it would have been tough today.”The words seemed to linger there an extra second, if only because of how Kaepernick arrived here and who would have played if he did not. Alex Smith was injured when Kaepernick replaced him, but despite what Harbaugh said initially, Kaepernick remained the starter when Smith recovered.The reasons for that became clearer Sunday. Kaepernick completed 16 of 21 passes for 233 yards and a touchdown. He made smart decisions. He shook off another slow start, same as against the Packers.While Smith also led the 49ers to an N.F.C. title game, just last season, the difference between victory and defeat, in reaching the Super Bowl or not, was the threat that Kaepernick would run. For as difficult as it was for Harbaugh to stick with Kaepernick, to bench Smith and not for playing poorly, he made the correct decision, despite the risk inherent in it.Smith had reached or at least neared his ceiling. Kaepernick had barely left the floor.His college coach at Nevada, Chris Ault, created the Pistol to work exactly as it did against Atlanta. He wanted to run the ball straight ahead and accomplished that with options and misdirection. The Falcons decided to contain Kaepernick, and that took commitment, with an extra defender or two required to monitor the edge. Against Green Bay, the 49ers ran Kaepernick outside, off zone reads, into the alleys they created off the tackles. When the Falcons took that away, Kaepernick simply handed the ball off to Gore, who dashed inside, between the tackles.“Gore’s scores were the read,” Ault wrote in a text message on Sunday night. “Kaep just handed it off. That’s the beauty of the play.”Indeed. And the beauty of the offense. The greatest concern with the Pistol, the reason some pundits believe it is more of a phase than a transformative offensive concept, is that requires quarterbacks to venture upfield, into danger. On Sunday, Kaepernick executed the Pistol and rarely ventured anywhere.Instead, Kaepernick slung the football around the field, using the throwing motion he revamped at Nevada, from sidearm to a more typical over-the-top motion. He looked like a quarterback, but not one who needed a disclaimer, or a backhanded compliment — mobile, athletic, etc. — in way of a description.Kaepernick rarely ran and still beat the Falcons with his legs. This marked another step in his evolution."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/golf/mickelson-citing-taxes-hints-at-stepping-away.html,"LA QUINTA, Calif. — After a middle-of-the-pack finish in his 2013 debut, Phil Mickelson stood off the 18th green at the Palmer Private course at PGA West on Sunday and talked about having to make, in his own words, “drastic changes.”He was not referring to his equipment. Mickelson, already one of the highest-earning athletes on the planet, is not considering switching the clubs in his bag or the clothes on his back, the way the world No. 1, Rory McIlroy, did last week after signing a lucrative endorsement deal with Nike.On the day President Obama was sworn in for his second term, Mickelson sent shock waves through the Humana Challenge when he said the political landscape in the United States was causing him to seriously contemplate his future in golf. Mickelson, who will turn 43 in June, has 40 PGA Tour victories, including four majors, and was inducted last year into the World Golf Hall of Fame.“I’m not going to jump the gun and do it right away,” he said after carding a six-under-par 66 to finish in a 10-way tie for 37th, “but there are going to be some drastic changes for me because I happen to be in that zone that has been targeted both federally and by the state. And, you know, it doesn’t work for me right now. So I’m going to have to make some changes.”As Mickelson spoke, the tournament was winding down to a scintillating conclusion. Brian Gay, who began the final round six strokes off the lead, closed with a nine-under 63 to end regulation tied with David Lingmerth (62) and Charles Howell III (64). He won with a 5-foot birdie on the second hole of the sudden-death playoff.Scott Stallings, the 54-hole leader, made his first bogey of the tournament on his seventh hole and finished with a 70 to tie for fourth with James Hahn, who capped his 62 with an eagle-3 at the 18th.Finishing eight strokes out of the playoff was Mickelson, who played the final three rounds in 17 under par but could not climb out of the hole he dug for himself with a par 72 start at La Quinta Country Club.“I played better as the week wore on,” Mickelson said. He added: “I feel like I’m starting to play some pretty good golf. So hopefully I’ll be able to make a run on the weekend next week, because that’s what’s exciting is having a chance to win.”Mickelson, the reigning champion at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, has more than $67 million in career earnings since turning professional in 1992. Last year, he was ranked by Forbes magazine as the seventh highest-paid athlete, with $47.8 million in earnings, including $43 million in endorsements.“If you add up all the federal and you look at the disability and the unemployment and the Social Security and state, my tax rate is 62, 63 percent,” Mickelson said. “So I’ve got to make some decisions on what to do.”Mickelson, who lives with his wife, Amy, and their three children outside San Diego, his hometown, said he planned to elaborate on his comments in more detail this week when the tour stopped in his backyard, at Torrey Pines in La Jolla, Calif.“It’s been an interesting off-season,” said Mickelson, who cracked open a window into his thought process last week during a teleconference. Asked if he has considered following his United States Ryder Cup teammate Steve Stricker, another 40-something golfer, into semiretirement, Mickelson replied: “You know, I think that we’re all going to have our own way of handling things, handling time in our career, our family, handling what’s going on the last couple of months politically. I think we’re all going to have to find things that work for us.”In December, Mickelson, who was part of a group that had bought the San Diego Padres four months earlier, abruptly announced that he was no longer involved in the business deal. His reversal came shortly after California voters approved Proposition 30, which imposed a 13.3 percent tax rate on incomes of more than $1 million.Asked Sunday if the election results played a role in his decision to sever his ties with the Padres’ ownership group, Mickelson replied, “Yeah, absolutely.”In vowing to discuss his thinking in more detail at Torrey Pines, Mickelson said: “I’ll probably be a little more open to it because San Diego is where I live, it’s where the Padre thing was a possibility and it’s where my family is. And it just seems like a better fit than right here off of 18 in Palm Springs.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/football/tom-brady-being-among-the-best-is-a-worthwhile-debate.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass.In his final weeks as a linebacker supreme, the Baltimore Ravens’ Ray Lewis has been feted and fawned over as if he were the greatest defensive player of all time. Quarterbacks face a different standard, however, a more quantifiable measure of greatness. For them, like coaches and N.B.A. superstars, the question is more cut and dried:How many victories — and in particular how many title rings — do you have?All discussion of the normally monolithic N.F.L. seemed to be suspended during the run-up to its conference championship games, obscured by a fictitious girlfriend and a fake on a bike. But television ratings are testimony to the fact that weekends from September to early February belong to the likes of Tom Brady and Lewis, who had a team-leading 6 solo tackles and 14 in all as the Ravens stunned Brady and the Patriots, 28-13, on Sunday night at Gillette Stadium.On to New Orleans go the Ravens to play the San Francisco 49ers in what will be a convention of head coaches named Harbaugh, along with a continuation of the Lewis retirement tour.From Brady’s side of the plot line, the Patriots’ second-half collapse and his failure to reach a sixth Super Bowl — which would have been a record for quarterbacks — further diminished the narrative of him as the greatest in history at his exalted position.It’s an entirely mythical distinction, but a far more palatable subject than the disturbing tales — on so many levels — of Manti Te’o’s virtual girlfriend and Lance Armstrong’s wanton deceit. Just where Brady ranks or ultimately will rank in the quarterback pantheon is at least an argument that puts sports in a more acceptable place — think of two guys on a barstool — in a culture that has become too easily manipulated in the continuing creation of false icons in the name of capitalism.Not that Brady isn’t rich enough to own three-quarters of New Hampshire, but at least his successes — athletically, commercially and romantically — haven’t resulted in the portrayal of him as anything more than what he is: a guy most of us can envy, without deification.Beyond standard partisan contempt, many outside New England do not even find Brady very likable and will exult in his latest ouster — not that he has ever done anything behaviorally suspicious that remotely compares to, say, Lewis’s connection to a brawl that left two men dead outside an Atlanta nightclub 13 years ago.Doesn’t the news media’s recent determination to rewrite that history for the sake of selling career-summary schmaltz help explain its gullibility on Te’o?For more than a decade, with players coming and going, Brady has won in the most unforgiving of American team sports with a ridiculous consistency, and managed to look darn good doing so.The most notable exceptions — at least until Sunday night — were his last two Super Bowls, with two thunderbolts of endgame lightning from the Giants’ Eli Manning separating Brady from perhaps an unquestioned perch at the top of QB Mountain.On Sunday night, about 15 minutes after Coach Bill Belichick was one decibel level above catatonic in his postgame interview, Brady lamented how the Patriots “just couldn’t make crucial plays when we needed to.”Asked about the finality of another rousing regular season turned to rubble, he said, sadly, “It always comes to a screeching halt,” and soon after walked off into the night for the eighth straight season without a Super Bowl ring.That Brady has those two Giants games on his record and still trails Joe Montana and Terry Bradshaw in Super Bowl titles by 4-3 has given heft to the notion that he falls short by comparison, possibly forever given his age, 35, and the trend that continued Sunday night.Against the Ravens, Brady wasn’t anyone’s idea of an all-timer. Then again, he wasn’t playing against, you know, the Jets. In his defense, the Patriots controlled field position for two and a half quarters, but on three drives into Baltimore territory, he had passes dropped on third down, including one by Wes Welker from the Ravens’ 34 early in the third quarter when a touchdown would have built on a 13-7 lead.A poor decision by Brady — who runs like a herniated plow horse — to scramble inside the Ravens’ 10 with seconds left in the first half didn’t help. A flurry of New England turnovers ensued, including two interceptions against Brady, and the Patriots’ defense, exploited for drives of 90 and 87 yards, pretty much caved.So, yes, it’s a team effort, win or lose, but let’s go along with the assertion that only a fourth Super Bowl title — connecting Brady’s early success to the back end of his career — will elevate him from here on out.For now, that debate is shelved while the celebration of Lewis, who has spent his 17-year, one Super Bowl-ring career with the Ravens, will carry on to the Big Easy.Watching a horde of photographers surround him on the field after the game — Lewis on his knees, face down, praying or preening — left us with the hope that the folks who hype the annual orgy of excess might want to go easy on the portrayal of him as anything more than a great football player blessed with the opportunity to go out on top.Whether Brady ever gets that chance, who knows? But if Lewis can be the sentimental favorite now, maybe someday he can be, too."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/football/injury-to-aqib-talib-diminishes-patriots-chances.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — The most crucial member of the Patriots on Sunday did not play the final 50 minutes. He hobbled off the field, then into the locker room, then grabbed a jacket and parked himself on the New England bench, from where he watched his departure loom large over the A.F.C. championship game.That player, Aqib Talib, is the Patriots’ best cover cornerback, and he hurt his thigh on Baltimore’s second offensive series. The odds of their missing him were probable. His return was announced as questionable. As Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco and his big receivers dismantled the diluted secondary, New England’s chances of a comeback were rendered doubtful.Then the Patriots were out — out of the playoffs, out of Super Bowl contention, after losing, 28-13, at Gillette Stadium. The Ravens, ousted here last season on a missed field goal that would have forced overtime, scored the final 21 points to advance to Super Bowl XLVII against the San Francisco 49ers on Feb. 3 in New Orleans.At Gillette Stadium, where according to the Elias Sports Bureau Patriots quarterback Tom Brady lost for the first time in 68 games in which he had led at halftime, fans started leaving midway through the fourth quarter. They bolted because of two splendid catches by Anquan Boldin, who capitalized on Talib’s absence, that expanded Baltimore’s lead to 15 points from 1 point in a 3-minute-43-second stretch.“I don’t think anything was as good as it needed to be tonight,” Patriots Coach Bill Belichick said.He was in a dour mood afterward, even more than usual. An eighth consecutive season without hoisting the Lombardi Trophy can do that to a man. So can watching Talib, whose arrival in a November trade with Tampa Bay stabilized the Patriots’ secondary, stagger to the sideline, after breaking up a pass intended for Boldin. Receivers like the 6-foot-1, 220-pound Boldin — big, strong and aggressive — can present problems for inexperienced cornerbacks, and Talib, listed at 6-2 and 202 pounds, had the size and instincts to match up with him.Boldin, who had 5 catches for 60 yards, did not pester the Patriots immediately. None of the Ravens’ receivers did. Of Flacco’s six first-half completions, only one was by a receiver.After halftime, Flacco shredded the New England secondary, whose members insisted afterward that they made the necessary adjustments, that they were surprised by nothing — except perhaps the result. The Ravens regrouped, making essential modifications. They put Flacco in the shotgun. They operated a hurry-up offense. They threw more in early-down situations. They deployed three receivers, spreading the defense.Safety Steve Gregory, in man coverage when Dennis Pitta fooled him on a 5-yard touchdown that put Baltimore ahead to stay, 14-13, said Flacco showed more patience in the second half.“It’s not like we don’t see it almost every day,” Patriots cornerback Kyle Arrington said, referring to practicing against a no-huddle offense. But, he lamented, “We just couldn’t get off the field.”The game turned early in the fourth quarter, with the Ravens leading, 21-13, when Bernard Pollard drilled Patriots running back Stevan Ridley in the helmet. For the fourth time in five seasons, Pollard injured a Patriots player: Brady’s knee in 2008; Wes Welker’s knee in 2009; Rob Gronkowski’s ankle in last year’s A.F.C. championship game.Ridley appeared to lose consciousness, and the ball popped free, recovered by Arthur Jones at the New England 47. Four plays later, Flacco recognized an advantage while reading the defense: Boldin in single coverage against Marquice Cole, a backup elevated by Talib’s injury.Earlier, on third-and-9, Boldin outdueled Cole down the sideline for a 26-yard gain. Flacco fired a perfect back-shoulder pass to Boldin, who leapt and caught it for an 11-yard touchdown while Cole was facing him.“The thing that Anquan’s taught all of us is to get after footballs,” the Baltimore receivers coach Jim Hostler said recently. “Meeting the ball with your hands — what it means to come back and get a ball — and make spectacular plays.”As Boldin did on his first touchdown, when he soared over Devin McCourty. Perhaps McCourty benefited most from Talib’s arrival, remaining at safety, where his range was maximized. But not Sunday.“You don’t see your season coming to an end,” McCourty said. “You can’t prepare for this.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/football/falcons-tumble-out-of-nfc-championship-game-against-49ers.html,"ATLANTA — For two and a half quarters, Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan could not have been more accurate if his passes had been guided by GPS. His choice targets in what tight end Tony Gonzalez has termed the P.Y.P. (Pick Your Poison) offense were making catches as if the ball and their hands were magnetized.At the time, Ryan was 20 for 26, one step shy of 300 yards, with the misses mostly a consequence of smothering coverage by San Francisco. Displaying a balance that is every offensive coordinator’s dream, Gonzalez and Julio Jones had seven receptions each, Roddy White six.The Falcons had already amassed 24 points in the N.F.C. championship game, scoring on four of five possessions, and were motoring for more. Maintain the pace, and there would be two weeks leading up to the Super Bowl to assign the nicknames Hemlock, Arsenic and Cyanide to the three receivers.It all changed when White slipped on a short route — “that one is all on me, losing my footing,” he said — and Chris Culliver intercepted the pass. Ryan regained his groove for a while, but a lost fumble on a snap that was all on him and dubious decisions on his final two incompletions doomed Atlanta to a 28-24 loss.“The way we started and to come up short, it’s tough to take,” said center Todd McClure, choking back tears.McClure, with 14 seasons’ worth of N.F.L. scars, might have played his last game. Gonzalez, the league’s most productive receiving tight end ever and with two years on McClure, almost certainly did.“It’s time,” said Gonzalez, who has extended his career partly to experience title games. “You can’t keep chasing the Super Bowl.”Ryan so effectively spread the wealth among the three that all of them caught passes on two scoring marches.“We came out like gangbusters,” Gonzalez said. Jones needed just one quarter to reach 100 yards, with two touchdowns, one when Ryan shoehorned a pass into a seemingly impossible spot in a corner of the end zone.“In the first half, we were playing bad,” 49ers linebacker Aldon Smith said. “We weren’t on the same page.”An ankle injury that ended Falcons tailback Michael Turner’s day early in the third period was fortunate for the visitors. It enabled them to gear up for passes.Additionally, Ryan hurt his left shoulder, though not seriously enough to cost him an offensive play.“I was all right, good enough to go,” said Ryan, who blamed momentary inattentiveness for the fumble. “I took my eye off the ball for a quick second.”Even so, the Falcons had two plays to cover 10 yards for a go-ahead touchdown inside the final two minutes. Ryan’s attempt on third down toward the sideline was tipped.The next play, the 49ers “kind of fooled us there,” Gonzalez said, by dropping nearly everyone in pass coverage. White, in the middle of the field, was blanketed by NaVorro Bowman, who batted away the ball.“The guy kind of jumped on my shoulder a little bit before the ball got there,” White said, “but they’re not going to call that.”A touchdown might have given the Falcons their eighth win this season after they trailed in the fourth quarter. “Absolutely,” Ryan said. “We had plenty of time.”And when they forced the 49ers into a three-and-out, there was still a scintilla of hope, Atlanta having yanked three victories out of a hat when starting the decisive drive inside the final minute.But with only six seconds left, all Ryan could muster was a connection with Jones that expired at San Francisco’s 35-yard line.When it ended, Gonzalez blew a kiss toward the stands to relatives, including his cowbell-clanging mother. Fifteen minutes later, he was the only Falcons player still in uniform at his locker, head buried in hands.He did not look like someone who would play next season, though the door was left almost imperceptibly ajar.“That’s probably going to be the last time I wear that uniform,” he said after a shower, citing the time away from his family. “I didn’t want to take it off, to tell you the truth. All good things come to an end.”They did Sunday for the N.F.C.’s No. 1 seed, which seemed bound for the Super Bowl for two and a half quarters — until the 49ers found an antidote for the Falcons’ poisonous passing attack."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/soccer/clint-dempsey-scores-late-equalizer-for-spurs-against-manchester-united.html,"Anyone who has been following the sports news in recent days might despair of the ethics, or lack of them, espoused by a certain cyclist from Texas.On Sunday, however, we were reminded that, in soccer anyway, the same state has produced Clint Dempsey. And Dempsey is a more fair-minded competitor than Lance Armstrong ever was.Time after time, Dempsey has scored priceless goals for club or country. His decent, honest opportunism may be old-fashioned, but it was again a match-saving quality Sunday.In a snowstorm, Dempsey won a point for Tottenham Hotspur against the English league leader, Manchester United. His goal, with seconds of added time to spare, was scooped into the net just when it seemed United would hold out for a 1-0 victory.Dempsey would not give up. He drove his tired body forward to square the score at 1-1 when all seemed lost. Earlier, he had run into the penalty box, hurdling tackles, refusing to go down when Patrice Evra fouled him.His mind was on scoring, not going to the ground in search of a penalty kick, which is all too common in the modern game.That honesty, that hunger to score legitimate goals, characterizes Dempsey. He had also been denied by extraordinary reflexes from United goaltender David de Gea on another occasion. “Man, I know he’s a great keeper,” Dempsey said after the game. “But I couldn’t believe that save.”Still, Dempsey persevered. With about 92 minutes 30 seconds gone, he ran one more time into the box. De Gea had failed in an attempted fisted clearance, and Dempsey was running even before his teammate Aaron Lennon played the ball back into the goal mouth.Dempsey’s short volley won a point and prevented United from taking a 7-point lead in the standings.“There’ll be no easy games for teams coming to Tottenham,” was the parting shot of United’s manager, Alex Ferguson. “We can take comfort from that.”The statistics show that United hoped to steal the points. It set out, unusually for a Ferguson side, to win by stealth, to double-mark Spurs’ top man, Gareth Bale, and to hit on the break.One hit almost looked enough. It came after 25 minutes, and came almost inevitably from Robin van Persie, who scored his 22nd goal since joining United from Arsenal last summer with what was, for him, an easy header. It was set up by marvelous passing between Shinji Kagawa, Michael Carrick, Danny Welbeck and Tom Cleverley.But after that, except for a penalty claim that should have been given to United, Spurs racked up 15 shots against just 4. Dempsey’s goal was overdue, and just.Earlier Sunday, across London, Chelsea ended a poor run of home failures by defeating Arsenal, 2-1.The key player was Chelsea’s midfield enforcer, Ramires, who competes with high energy, sometimes on the limit of fair play, sometimes beyond it.Arsenal’s manager, Arsène Wenger, complained that his team was developing a debilitating habit of starting on the back foot. In fact, it missed a golden opportunity to lead after five minutes.The chance was squandered by Olivier Giroud, who is becoming something of a non-striking striker. With the goal at his mercy, Giroud shot well wide.Less than a minute later, Chelsea scored. Arsenal protested that Ramires had stepped on the foot of Francis Coquelin as the play took shape, but the referee Martin Atkinson saw no foul and allowed the ball to roll on to Juan Mata, who controlled the ball smartly and shot venomously into the goal.Arsenal’s grievance was compounded 10 minutes later when the industrious Ramires ran toward goal, saw goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny stretch out his leg and fell over it.A penalty was given. TV pundits called it a “clever dive” by Ramires. Frank Lampard, Chelsea’s penalty-taker-in-chief, scored.Arsenal channeled its wrath into a stirring second half. Theo Walcott struck a fine goal, created by Santi Cazorla — a first dividend from Walcott.Chelsea, however, hung onto the 3 points despite another barren display by Fernando Torres, who was removed before the end — booed by fans but applauded by the big boss, the owner Roman Abramovich.The victory put Chelsea in third place, 6 points behind Manchester City and 11 points shy of United. The loss left Arsenal farther away from the Champions League places than it has ever been in 16 seasons under Wenger."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/hockey/nhl-hockey-roundup.html,"Zach Parise scored his first goal with the Wild and Josh Harding stopped all 24 shots he faced in his first start since being found to have multiple sclerosis as host Minnesota beat the Dallas Stars, 1-0, on Sunday night.Parise, who was the Devils’ captain until signing a 13-year, $98 million contract with Minnesota in the off-season, notched his third point with the Wild a night after getting two assists in Minnesota’s season-opening win against Colorado.Parise’s first goal of the season came at 8 minute 11 seconds of the first period just as a four-on-three advantage for the Wild expired. He one-timed a pass from Pierre-Marc Bouchard past Cristopher Nilstorp from the slot.Nilstorp, who signed with the Stars in June after playing the previous four seasons in the Swedish Elite League, stopped 31 shots in his first career N.H.L. start.Harding, who gained his seventh career shutout, became one of Minnesota’s feel-good stories last fall when the team announced his intentions to manage his illness and continue playing. Earlier in the summer, he passed on the chance to leave and instead re-signed with the Wild to play behind Niklas Backstrom again.“I can’t say I’m surprised with how well he played,” said Parise, who skated with Harding frequently at the University of Minnesota during the lockout. “He’s been looking good for a while.”SABRES 5, FLYERS 2 A nine-month layoff because of the N.H.L. lockout was not long enough to disrupt the chemistry between the Buffalo Sabres’ top two linemates, Thomas Vanek and Jason Pominville.Vanek scored twice and added three assists, and Pominville had three assists in leading the host Sabres to a season-opening win over the Philadelphia Flyers.The Sabres scored the game’s final four goals — the last three coming in the final five minutes.Vanek became the first Sabres player with five points in a game since Drew Stafford had three goals and two assists in January 2008.Cody Hodgson and the newly acquired forward Steve Ott also scored for the Sabres, while Ryan Miller made 27 saves. Buffalo ended a five-game skid against the Flyers (1-4-1) and improved to 6-1-1 in its past eight openers.Claude Giroux, with his second goal of the season, and Sean Couturier scored for the Flyers.SHARKS 4, FLAMES 1 Patrick Marleau scored two goals to lead visiting San Jose to a victory over Calgary in the opener for both teams. Martin Havlat and defenseman Dan Boyle also scored for the Sharks during a three-goal second period.San Jose spoiled Bob Hartley’s debut as the Flames’ coach.OILERS 3, CANUCKS 2 Ales Hemsky scored the tying goal for Edmonton and then had the clinching shootout goal as the Oilers won at Vancouver.The Canucks started goalie Roberto Luongo, who has been the subject of trade speculation. He made 30 saves.CAPUANO OUT OF HOSPITAL Islanders Coach Jack Capuano is out of a hospital after surgery to treat kidney stones, but it is unknown when he will make his season debut behind the bench.Capuano was released Sunday morning after having surgery Saturday night, when the Islanders opened the season with a 2-1 home loss to the Devils.The Islanders host Tampa Bay on Monday, and a team spokesman says Sunday it was still to be determined whether Capuano would coach the team then.STRONG RATINGS NBC’s broadcast Saturday earned the highest preliminary rating for a non-Winter Classic regular-season game since 2002. The network said its regional coverage of Blackhawks-Kings and Penguins-Flyers averaged a 2.0 overnight rating. That’s up 67 percent from the season average on NBC last year."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/hockey/blue-hued-seats-return-to-madison-square-garden.html,"The nose bleeds, the rafters, the cheap seats. Whatever their name, they more or less mean the same thing: they are where the die-hards sit.For the last 45 years, Rangers fans have known them as the Blue Seats in recognition of the former color of the seats in the upper tier of Madison Square Garden. Back in the day, there were betting pools, a hefty amount of beer consumed and a hazy smoke with a whiff of the illicit. Some fans threw rolls of toilet paper or fruit on the ice after a Rangers goal or a bad call by the referee.Those freewheeling days are largely gone; thanks to a three-year overhaul of the Garden, so are many of those seats. During the off-season, most of the upper tier was removed so that the bowl below could be extended upward. The last 1,000 or of the seats are behind the goal at the west end of the arena.At the Rangers’ home opener Sunday, fans returned to find new seats that matched the blue in those installed in 1968, when the Garden opened. Television screens have been added, as well as new concession stands and bathrooms. The sections were slightly reconfigured, but the structure of the balcony was untouched and the vibe unchanged.“This is where the true fans sit,” said Leo Strauss, who has had season tickets in the Blue Seats since 1968. “We bleed blue.”Like Strauss, other Blue Seaters remain fiercely loyal and caustically cynical, and sneer at whom they believe to be the more casual and wealthier fans sitting below. They date their devotion to the Rangers in decades, not years, consider their seatmates an extended family and appreciate the team’s recent success, partly because they endured the down years.“You see the same people up there, and you just laugh, the guy who curses, the guy who gets drunk, the woman who knows her hockey and can be pretty sarcastically vicious,” said Steve Kupietzky, who shares a pair of blue seats with Neal Lipschitz, who has had them for more than 40 years. “When you go further down, it’s a different culture.”Smoking was banned long ago, and beer sales now end well before the final buzzer. But one hallmark of the Blue Seats that endures is the salty language. One chant was targeted at those sitting closest to the ice in what were once red seats. It suggested that the working stiffs in the Blue Seats despised the fats cats below, but it was also tribal.“I could’ve afforded the red seats, but I liked where I was sitting,” said Lipschitz, who brought his grandson Sam to opening night.Sonny Werblin, the former chairman of the Garden, got his share of abuse, as did referees and opposing players. The most notorious villain, though, was Denis Potvin, the former Islanders defenseman, who is derided in absentia, and seemingly in perpetuity, for breaking Ulf Nilsson’s ankle in 1979.The Blue Seaters have their favorites, too, including Nick Fotiu, the Staten Island native and Rangers enforcer for eight seasons. In addition to brawling with opponents, he tossed dozens of pucks into the stands every game and hurled more than a few of them up to the Blue Seats.“It started because I never got a puck when I was a kid, and I said if I ever made it to the N.H.L., I would throw some to the crowd,” Fotiu said, adding that he hit the ceiling occasionally. “I go up there now and I look down and say, How the heck did I get them to the fans up here?”Every so often, he meets a fan who claims to have one of his pucks.Of course, there are plenty of fervent fans who sit elsewhere. The Rangers’ longest-tenured season-ticket holder — 62 years and counting — sits in the club seats, and 31 fans have had season tickets for at least a half-century. Almost half of the team’s season-ticket holders have had seats for more than a decade.At the old Madison Square Garden on Eighth Avenue, the faithful sat in the end balcony, which had to be reached via separate staircases.“There was an ambience,” said Stan Fischler, the hockey historian and announcer who had season tickets in the end balcony starting in 1946. All upper decks, he said, “have something in common: they hate the referee.”At $47 apiece for season-ticket holders, the Blue Seats are a relative bargain. But fans who sit there insist the views are part of the draw, too, because you can see plays develop as the teams skate down the ice. And then there is the thought that there are plenty of others who would gladly take your seat.“Part of it will always be the money,” said Bob Schuler, who has had season tickets in the Blue Seats for more than 40 years. “But we know if we left, we could never get them again because they’d be snapped up in a minute.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/football/super-bowl-joe-flacco-shrugs-off-critics-and-chalks-up-wins.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Joe Flacco is doing things that no other quarterback in the N.F.L. has done.Since joining the Baltimore Ravens as a first-round draft pick out of Delaware in 2008, he has won more games — regular-season and postseason combined — than any other starting quarterback, and that includes colleagues named Manning, Brady and Rodgers. Win No. 62 for Flacco came Sunday night at Gillette Stadium, where he and the Ravens steered themselves into the Super Bowl by soundly defeating the New England Patriots, 28-13, to win the A.F.C. championship.Yet for all his achievements, and there are many, Flacco has not always been warmly embraced outside his locker room. Critics have prodded at his statistics, citing his middling 54.4-percent completion rate in the postseason and his marginally better-than-average career passer rating of 86.3. His reputation as a game manager, a thinly veiled criticism in football circles, has trailed him like a rusty muffler.That could be changing. Flacco continued his remarkable postseason run by carving up the Patriots, completing 21 of 36 passes for 240 yards and 3 touchdowns. Much of his best work came in the second half, when Baltimore outscored New England, 21-0. More surprising, it was business as usual for Flacco, who has now outshone Andrew Luck, Peyton Manning and Tom Brady during the Ravens’ three-game playoff streak.Flacco, the first quarterback to win at least one playoff game in each of his first five seasons, returned Monday to the team’s practice facility, where he said his mission for the next 24 hours would be to secure enough Super Bowl tickets for his family and friends. After that, the Ravens will turn their full attention to the San Francisco 49ers.“I don’t know if anyone’s quite believed it yet, but it’s pretty real,” Flacco said.There has long been a certain futility for Flacco when it comes to defending his position in the N.F.L. quarterback hierarchy. Does he consider himself an elite player? Does he think the critiques are fair? Flacco has grown skilled at sidestepping such analysis.On Monday, for example, he was asked whether he felt any sense of vindication after advancing to his first Super Bowl.“I don’t know,” he said. “We’re just going out there playing football.”When it was mentioned that Flacco, 28, would be considered the crafty veteran in a matchup against Colin Kaepernick, the 49ers’ second-year quarterback, Flacco dismissed the comparison. It never crosses his mind, he said.“It’s funny how things work and how you guys talk about things,” he said, referring to the news media. “We’re just out there playing a game.”Coach John Harbaugh said he viewed Flacco’s postseason performance — 853 passing yards, 8 touchdowns and no interceptions — as part of a natural progression. Sounding like the chief executive of a wallboard manufacturer, Harbaugh described Flacco’s play as “some good output, honestly, in terms of production.”None of it has seemed to surprise Harbaugh.“But to string it together like he’s done — back-to-back-to-back in the most critical time of the year — is the great thing about it,” Harbaugh said. “And I really believe that we saw that coming as a football staff and as an organization. It’s just the way he’s been practicing.”At this stage of their relationship, Harbaugh said, he feels comfortable consulting Flacco on a wide range of issues. Halftime of Sunday’s game was not an instance in which he deemed it necessary. The Ravens were trailing the Patriots, 13-7, when Harbaugh made a cameo in the offensive meeting.“John came over and said, ‘Listen, we didn’t come all this way to play it safe and hope to win a football game,’ ” Flacco said. “We had nothing to lose.”The offensive coordinator Jim Caldwell decided to go with a three-receiver set, and Harbaugh said he could tell that Flacco supported the move. He went to work in the second half, completing 15 of 24 passes for 159 yards and all 3 of his touchdowns.“It wasn’t something where we had to go ask Joe, ‘Joe, what do you want to do?’ ” Harbaugh said. “We had a pretty good idea what Joe wanted to do.”Flacco, who will become a free agent after the Super Bowl and typically conveys about as much emotion as a lamppost, said he always thought about being a Super Bowl quarterback, even when he was in college. Flacco used that word — always — three times, repeating it like a mantra, an unusual point of emphasis from him. He made sure to get his message across.He never doubted himself, even if others did.EXTRA POINTSJohn Harbaugh said Monday that Jim Caldwell would stay on as the Ravens’ offensive coordinator next season. Caldwell was promoted to coordinator from quarterbacks coach Dec. 9 after Harbaugh fired Cam Cameron."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/more-to-the-super-bowl-than-the-coaches-leading-off.html,"Ladies and gentlemen, start your Harbaugh stories.Yes, let’s go ahead and have an official starting line and if someone out there would wave a green flag for us, fantastic. Because the next two weeks will be filled with stories about the Harbaugh Bowl, shortened to Har-Bowl for the attention-span challenged. You may be driven to shorten it even further by tuning out the hyperbole for the next two weeks. Sure, you may miss a gem or two, but oh, you’ll hear it all again when John and Jim Harbaugh take up their positions on opposite sidelines in New Orleans.Sunday’s conference championship games produced this phenomenon, thanks to San Francisco’s come-from-behind victory at Atlanta and the Ravens’ second-half dominance at New England. In brotherly fashion, both Coach Harbaughs took their teams on the road and earned themselves Super Bowl berths in most unlikely fashion. Both coached magnificent games, writes Peter King on SI.com, and used bold decisions during the season to spur their teams’ runs, as John Clayton writes on ESPN.com. One proved he is a little more high-strung than the other (ahem, that would be you, Jim) and the other proved it is not always crazy to dump your offensive coordinator in the middle of the season (you can take a bow for that, John).Here’s a quick primer for the next two weeks of Har-Bowl mania: John is 15 months older; their father, Jack, was a coach for 43 years; Jack and Jackie have been married for 51 years and have a penchant for the letter J; their sister Joani is married to Indiana’s basketball coach, Tom Crean. You will not hear a lot from the Harbaugh parents these two weeks because they are not crazy about attention — the brothers have already tried to dissuade people from talking about them too much, Clark Judge writes on CBSSports.com, to no avail — and at some point it will strike you how fortunate we are the two Super Bowl coaches are not named Kardashian.Their teams are mighty interesting, too, which may be washed over in the Har-Bowl mania. The Ravens took part of center stage with an amazing team effort against the Patriots, writes Jeffri Chadiha on ESPN.com, a result of frustrations and injuries and past failures, Dan Wetzel writes on Yahoo.com. They are the latest examples, after the Packers and Giants of the past two seasons, of adversity-tested teams coming through in January, Don Banks writes on SI.com.Many words will be expended on Ray Lewis’s triumphant final ride to the Super Bowl, but this game put a far bigger spotlight on quarterback Joe Flacco, who might now receive his due after winning his N.F.L.-record sixth road playoff victory, as Jason Cole writes on Yahoo.com. This had a lot to do with the Ravens’ revamped offensive line, too, writes Mike Preston in The Baltimore Sun, and all the lessons learned from the bumps along the way, Alex Marvez writes on Foxsports.com.The flip side to the Ravens’ happiness was the Patriots’ tumble from their usual perch, which may be the sign of a larger fall, Mike Freeman writes on CBSSports.com. Quarterback Tom Brady took a few lumps, both physical and metaphorical, and well, Bill Belichick isn’t exactly rocking that hoodie these days.In San Francisco’s victory, Atlanta played its role as star-crossed franchise well, taking that 17-0 lead and coughing it up in dramatic, if unsurprising, fashion. That left the 49ers to make their latest mad dash to victory seem wilder than all the others, Mark Purdy writes in The San Jose Mercury News. The success of quarterback Colin Kaepernick is scrubbing the memory of how debated his promotion to starter was at midseason, Les Carpenter writes on Yahoo.com, and his doubters are dwindling by the minute, Scott Ostler writes in The San Francisco Chronicle.Those little tidbits will be washed under in Harbaugh mania, but they will not be alone. It was possible not to realize tennis’s first major of the year was going on, and no one named Harbaugh was playing. Sloane Stephens is, and she has made it to the quarterfinals, and if you’d like to catch up on everything you missed in the first week, Jon Wertheim of SI.com can help you with that.The start of the N.H.L. season was brilliantly planned for the weekend when everyone would be watching football, perhaps in the hopes that people would forget they skipped the first three months of the season. Among the notable moments you missed were Minnesota goaltender Josh Harding’s playing his first game since receiving a diagnosis of multiple sclerosis, the Canucks managing to ignite a goalie controversy in the span of two whole games, and the Rangers’ Broadway opening turning into a major flop.If there is one good thing about the Harbaugh overload this weekend, it was a respite from the Manti Te’o fraudulent girlfriend mania. His off-air interview with ESPN’s Jeremy Schaap succeeded in making the whole thing seem even more dumbfounding, writes Ted Miller on ESPN.com. SI.com’s Richard Deitsch has a terrific in-depth look at how this mad spectacle has unfolded in the news media, which comes as prelude to the news that Te’o has awarded his first on-camera interview to ABC’s Katie Couric, although that will not be broadcast until Thursday. To that, the instant response was, no Oprah?!Maybe she’ll line up the big interview with the Harbaughs’ parents. Or maybe you will find them in the same Super Bowl hype-proof bunker you crawl into.Follow Leading Off on Twitter: twitter.com/zinsernyt"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/hockey/nhl-teams-come-out-fighting-from-the-start.html,"The N.H.L. returned over the weekend to sold-out arenas and record opening-day television audiences. It also returned to fighting. The first 21 games featured 12 fights, including three that took place within the first two seconds of the opening face-off.On Monday afternoon on Long Island, Matt Martin of the Islanders threw down his gloves and fought with B. J. Crombeen of Tampa Bay. A few feet away, the Islanders’ Joe Finley fought Pierre-Cedric Labrie. Both fights took place a second after the opening draw.On Sunday night at the Rangers’ home opener, Arron Asham fought Pittsburgh’s Tanner Glass just two seconds after the game began. They stood toe-to-toe for nearly a minute, throwing 45 punches and landing 20, according dropyourgloves.com.None of the three fights were in retaliation for a previous collision or to protect a star player. The players involved, all frequent fighters, were inserted into the opening lineup by their coaches. Once on the ice, they simply asked each other and then dropped their gloves. And they were frank about it afterward.“I asked him when we lined up, he agreed, and away we went,” Asham said. “All fights are to try and get your bench going, get the crowd into it.”Martin said pretty much the same thing.“We saw what their starting lineup was before we went on the ice, and me and Fins wanted to get the crowd going early,” he said of Finley. “I think we did a good job of that.”Calls to curtail fighting came from many quarters after the May 2011 death of the Rangers’ Derek Boogaard from an overdose of alcohol and painkillers, and after the apparent suicides of two other players who fought frequently. Subsequent research showed that Boogaard, like other deceased N.H.L. players whose brains were studied, had sustained extensive brain trauma that scientists concluded was caused by repeated blows to the head.The N.H.L. has said no link between fighting and brain trauma has been proved, and players and league officials both maintain that fighting is an integral part of the game.Still, in recent seasons the league toughened rules against checks to the head in an effort to reduce concussions, and it brought in a respected former player, Brendan Shanahan, to administer tighter discipline against players who commit dangerous fouls.But the league has long maintained that it penalizes fighting enough with five-minute majors, game misconducts and supplementary discipline. A fight that starts before the opening face-off or after the end of the game triggers heavy fines against teams and potential suspensions for the coaches and players involved.The players have resisted rules that sharply curtail fighting because such measures would cost certain players their jobs, and because they largely contend that fighters police the game and prevent greater mayhem from breaking out.In 2009, N.H.L. general managers made a modest effort to curtail staged fights like the Asham-Glass bout, recommending an additional 10-minute misconduct if a fight took place right after a face-off. But the players’ union shot down the measure.On Monday, the N.H.L. and the players’ association declined to respond to questions about whether new measures against staged fights would be considered.The collective bargaining agreement reached earlier this month includes a new Joint Health and Safety Committee, which will have equal representation from the N.H.L. and the N.H.L.P.A. and will have an advisory role. Nothing in the agreement pertains specifically to fighting. Commissioner Gary Bettman has pointed out that fighting over all is steadily declining.Under Coach John Tortorella, though, the Rangers have gained a reputation for their snarl. They had 62 fighting majors in 2010-11 and led the N.H.L. with 65 fighting majors last season. Nine of those came from fights that took place within the first 10 seconds of the opening face-off, including a line brawl three seconds into a game against the Devils on March 19, in which three fights broke out simultaneously.This season the Rangers have had three fights in two games. One included Asham, 34, whom the Rangers signed from Pittsburgh in the off-season. He now has 91 N.H.L. regular-season fights.“I don’t expect him to be a saint,” Tortorella said before Asham’s Rangers debut Sunday.After a dismal 6-3 Rangers loss, Asham was about the only player Tortorella praised.“High marks for Ash,” he said. “When a player does something like that, as long as he did that, the other guys need to feed off that and do their thing. And that has not happened.”Glass’s version of what happened might have been more revealing of prevailing attitudes.“I just said ‘hi’ to him at the face-off,” Glass told Pittsburgh reporters. “I squared off against him. He said, ‘Do you want to do this?’ I said, ‘Sure.’“He said, ‘Good luck,’ ” Glass said. “I like when a guy does that.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/football/falcons-ryan-out-of-pro-bowl.html,Atlanta quarterback Matt Ryan sprained his left shoulder in the closing minutes of the N.F.C. championship game and will not play in the Pro Bowl on Sunday.
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/tennis/australian-open-sloane-stephens-to-face-serena-williams.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia — Sloane Stephens does not want your pity, not for the sadness in her family’s past and certainly not for the fact that she is about to face Serena Williams, winner of 15 Grand Slam singles titles and 20 straight matches.“I’m ready to play already,” said Stephens, legs crossed in the sunshine as she sat for an interview at the Australian Open. “Let’s just get to it. I really think it’s going to be fun.”This will be the 35th Grand Slam quarterfinal for Williams, the 31-year-old American champion. It will be the first for Stephens, a 19-year-old from Los Angeles who has a personality nearly as lively as her footwork.Although Stephens has an effervescent side and a smile that can light up an interview room, there were no cartwheels or wide-eyed expressions of delight Monday in Hisense Arena after she beat Bojana Jovanovski in three sets in the fourth round.It was as if Stephens had been here before, even if she has not.“It’s just kind of normal,” Stephens said after her win. “I think I’ve just worked so hard for it that I just feel like now it’s supposed to come. Even if I didn’t win today, that would have been O.K. But I know it’s coming. It’s supposed to happen.”Stephens has been hearing about her grand tennis destiny for years. Donald Dell, one of the most experienced agents and talent spotters in tennis, was hustling to get courtside when she was still playing junior tournaments. And he was not alone.Stephens has made steady progress: finishing in the top 200 in 2010, the top 100 in 2011 and the top 50 last year, when she reached the fourth round of the French Open and tore an abdominal muscle in the process.Though she played on in pain, she followed medical advice after losing in the third round of last year’s United States Open, resting for eight weeks rather than having surgery.To avoid risking further wear and tear, she is not playing doubles. But she is playing singles very effectively. She is ranked 25th, but her run here means she will break into the top 20, making her the statistical leader of a promising generation of American women that includes Christina McHale, Jamie Hampton, Melanie Oudin and the 17-year-old Madison Keys.Oudin, now 21, was the first to make an impact, reaching the quarterfinals of the United States Open in 2009. But she has struggled for consistency against more powerful opponents.Though Stephens, at 5 feet 7 inches, is also shorter than many of her present and future rivals, power is not an issue. She has a big forehand, a solid two-handed backhand and a convincing serve, driven by her powerful legs. She also has serious speed.“She’s probably one of the quickest players out here,” said David Nainkin, who coaches Stephens and the leading American men’s player, Sam Querrey, through the United States Tennis Association’s player development program in Carson. Calif.The shared coaching arrangement began last summer after Stephens split with her longtime coach Roger Smith. She and Querrey have a close relationship and a friendly rivalry that seems to drive Stephens as much as any rivalry on the WTA Tour.“I asked her in the off-season what her goals were — asked her seriously,” Nainkin said. “And she said, ‘I want to be ranked higher than Sam.’ ”She is off to a good start. With Querrey ranked 22nd, she will be ahead of him come Monday. “Well, there’s really no bet; I think it’s just for pride,” Stephens said. “But obviously, egos are big. This is tennis.”True, and Stephens now has her second chance in a month to see how her game and self-belief matches up against Williams, the game’s gold standard despite her No. 3 ranking.Williams and Stephens played charades and bonded as Fed Cup teammates last year on a long trip to Ukraine. The have spent time together on and off the court in Los Angeles and finally played each other this month in Brisbane, Australia, with Williams winning, 6-4, 6-3, in a quarterfinal that was hardly one-way traffic.In Brisbane, Stephens remarked during a changeover that Williams’s on-court bellows of “Come on!” were “disrespectful.” She said she was joking, but there is no doubt that Williams in full competitive mode can be an intimidating sight and sound.Williams is also on quite a roll, having dropped just eight games in four matches in Melbourne.“Definitely intense,” Stephens said of playing Williams. “In Brisbane, it was weird, really weird, to play her. But I think once you get your first-timers out of the way, it’s fine.“It will be tough, obviously. It’s quarters of a Grand Slam. There won’t be like that first time, ‘Oh my God, I’m playing Serena!’ That’s kind of out the window now. So that’s good.”Stephens lives in Westwood near the U.C.L.A. campus and generally practices with men. She lives with her mother, Sybil Smith, a psychologist and former all-American swimmer at Boston University, and her younger brother Shawn. They did not make the long journey to Australia with her because of Shawn’s commitments at home.Stephens spent little time with her biological father, the former N.F.L. running back John Stephens. He died in a car crash in 2009, not long after she had re-established contact. Her stepfather, Sheldon Smith, died of cancer in 2007.“You’ve just got to play the cards you’re dealt in life,” Stephens said. “I think I’ve coped pretty well. It’s just me, my mom and my brother, and I think my mom has done a really great job with me and my brother. I mean, things happen, and you’ve just kind of got to learn and move on. People in this world are far worse off than me. I don’t have a dad. I lost my stepdad, too, but I’ve been given everything. I have the best family in the world. I have my grandparents, my mom, my uncles, everyone. I’ve had some tough things happen to me, but I’ve never in my life wanted for anything.”The last time two American women met in a Grand Slam quarterfinal was at the 2008 United States Open, where Serena beat her older sister Venus. The last three times before that were in 2004 when Serena Williams and Jennifer Capriati played in the quarterfinals of all but one of the Grand Slam events.Though Stephens has long admired Serena Williams’s ability and once had a poster of her on her wall, she said she did not begin playing because of Serena or Venus. “I got into it because it was an after-school activity and it was fun,” she said.She also said, in an interview last year, that the fact that she and the Williamses are African-Americans had not been a major factor in making them role models.“It doesn’t matter what race you are,” Stephens said. “If you are an amazing athlete and an amazing person and you can do unbelievable things through your sport, anyone will look up to you. I mean I love Kim Clijsters. I love so many different players. It doesn’t matter that they are American or African-American.”Stephens said Monday that she was not looking for “an idol” in general and that she considered Williams a friend. One of their conversational topics in Melbourne has been grunting.“We were talking and talking about grunting, and one of the ladies with us was just like, ‘Do you grunt?’ ” Stephens said. “And I was like, ‘I think so.’ And Serena’s like, ‘No you don’t.’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, I do.’ And she was like: ‘No dude, you don’t. You’re so quiet. You’re like a mouse on the court.’“And I’m like: ‘O.K., whatever. I’m a mouse.’ And she’s like, ‘I’m such a spaz, but you’re so quiet.’ And I’m like ‘O.K., whatever, this is ridiculous.’ ”Mouse or not, she will do her best to roar back if and when Williams comes at her hard in Wednesday’s quarterfinal.“The thing about Sloane,” Nainkin said, “is she can raise her level.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/golf/players-eager-to-be-heard-before-putters-are-banned.html,"SAN DIEGO — And Brendan Steele thought last year’s mandatory PGA Tour players’ meeting was contentious.The divisive issue when golfers gathered here in 2012 was a proposal that top performers at qualifying school proceed to the Web.com circuit instead of gaining PGA Tour privileges.Steele has braced himself for an even more rancorous debate Tuesday over anchored putters when the players convene before the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines. The session is taking place on Day 56 of a 90-day period in which the United States Golf Association and the Royal & Ancient, the two governing bodies of golf, are entertaining feedback on their proposed ban of the anchored putting stroke used by three of the last five major winners, including Keegan Bradley, who is also in this week’s field.“It’s been a very hot topic and very frustrating from my point of view,” said Steele, who uses an anchored stroke and who last week was voted onto this year’s 16-member Player Advisory Council.Mike Davis, the U.S.G.A.’s executive director, will address the players as a group for the first time since the proposed ban was announced Nov. 28. He has said he will explain the ruling and the rationale behind the decision and answer questions.Long putters have been part of the game for decades, but before 2001, only three players had won a PGA Tour event while using one. They became a hot issue last year when they were used by 43-year-old Ernie Els in his victory at the British Open in July and by 14-year-old Guan Tianlang in his victory at the Asia-Pacific Championship in November. The use of the club by champions of such divergent ages signaled to the powers that be in golf that the long putter had transitioned from curiosity to keepsake.“I definitely appreciate that Mike Davis is willing to step up before us and somewhat face the music and give us some sort of an explanation of why they’re acting now when this stroke has been around for a long time,” Steele said. “If he steps up and tells us the reason for the ban now is that so many guys are using it, they’re using it too young and too many guys are winning majors with it, I know I’d be more accepting of it because at least that would seem like a more honest explanation than what we’ve been hearing, which is that it’s to protect the integrity of the game.”The way Steele sees it, the discussion on anchored strokes could go in any number of directions. Will the proposed ban, which is scheduled to take effect in 2016, be put into effect earlier so players who use the stroke will not feel stigmatized?Is there a possibility it will be modified to include only players born after a certain year, say, 2000, which would eventually eliminate the anchored stroke through attrition? Would the PGA Tour consider not adopting the rule change at all?“I just don’t have enough answers to know what’s going to happen,” said Steele, 29, who earned his only tour win in 2011. “I’m willing to give my approval when it’s necessary if Mike Davis comes in and gives a sound presentation and we can actually have a discussion. If he comes in and says, ‘Guys, I don’t know what to tell you, here’s what we’re going to do and deal with it,’ it could get really uncomfortable.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/baseball/pedro-feliciano-returning-to-mets-from-yankees.html,"With $8 million worth of Yankees gold in his pockets and two years of their best medical services invested in his shoulder, Pedro Feliciano is returning to the Mets without ever having thrown a pitch for the Yankees.Feliciano, a 36-year-old left-handed reliever, signed a minor league deal Monday with the Mets, the only team for which he has ever pitched in the majors.Rarely in the history of the interborough rivalry has one player caused such consternation on both sides of the divide, and it is one small case in which the Mets actually emerged as victors.For the Yankees, Feliciano represents a waste of money, time and effort. He even irritated some teammates with his loud sound system in the spring training clubhouse in Tampa, Fla., in 2011. Once he became a free agent after the 2012 season, the Yankees never made an offer to re-sign him, even to a minor league deal.“He got hurt, and we never saw him,” Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said Monday. “Unfortunately, it happens sometimes in this business.”But Feliciano was a stalwart relief pitcher for the Mets, dating to the final days of Bobby Valentine’s tenure in 2002. Sandwiched around a season in Japan in 2005, Feliciano was a dependable left-handed specialist, who led baseball in appearances three straight years, from 2008 to 2010. Having proved his durability — or so it seemed — Feliciano was signed by the Yankees.But in spring training in 2011, Feliciano developed pain in his left shoulder, was found to have a torn rotator cuff and was shut down for the season. Cashman accused the Mets of maltreatment, saying the number of times Feliciano had pitched over the years “abused” him.This only seemed to amuse the Mets and pitching coach Dan Warthen, who wondered aloud if the Yankees were unaware of the back of Feliciano’s baseball card. Cashman, of course, was. But he noted that the market for left-handed relievers was so thin that they had to take a chance — an expensive one, at that — on Feliciano.Warthen vehemently denied the accusation, though he said the Mets did not re-sign him because of his high innings count (the real reason likely had more to do with the Mets financial constraints at the time).“He volunteered the baseball every day,” Warthen said at the time in response to the accusation. “He was asked if he was able to pitch and he said yes every day and wanted to pitch more than we even pitched him. So I feel badly that someone feels that way, but that was part of the reason that we decided not to re-sign him, because we knew we had used him some 270 times the last three years.”Stung by those comments, Feliciano vowed that he would come back and take his revenge on Warthen in the interleague series between the two teams.“When I strike out Ike Davis and I jump on the mound, I’ll be like, ‘That’s for you,’ ” he said.But that confrontation never took place. Feliciano never came back. He had surgery on Sept. 11, 2011, and then began a renewed rehabilitation program with the Yankees. Toward the end of last season he was appeared on the verge of joining the Yankees last September, despite only throwing 83 miles per hour, but he sprained his ankle and was again shut down.Last spring, while working out with the Yankees in Tampa, Feliciano promised he would return sooner than people expected.“I’m going to surprise a lot of people,” he said.But really, the idea of Feliciano pitching for the Mets again is not that surprising at all."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/hockey/close-knit-group-of-players-could-end-oilers-postseason-drought.html,"VANCOUVER, British Columbia — While N.H.L. arenas sat empty and a bitter labor dispute played out in New York conference rooms in mid-December, four rising stars for the Edmonton Oilers continued to compete.For nearly three months, Taylor Hall, Ryan Nugent-Hopkins, Jordan Eberle and Justin Schultz played for the American Hockey League’s Oklahoma City Barons, the Oilers’ minor league affiliate. They dazzled modest-size crowds with their speed and ability to effortlessly score.Outside of the rink, the group lived in the same downtown apartment complex, where they rode their bicycles to and from the arena. On off days, they dined out together, watched movies and attended Oklahoma City Thunder games.They are a close-knit group of friends who form the young, talent-rich core that many fans and experts believe could make the Oilers a surprise team of the lockout-shortened season.“With that caliber of talent and skill level, they’re going to be really special soon,” said Wayne Gretzky, who led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups in the 1980s.Kelly Hrudey, a former N.H.L. goalie and current television analyst for “Hockey Night in Canada” said: “This is a really exciting team with a great young nucleus. I just think this is a team that could be the team of the future.”Reaching the playoffs would be a good beginning for the Oilers. Since falling 3-1 to the Carolina Hurricanes in Game 7 of the 2006 Stanley Cup finals, Edmonton has hit a postseason drought, failing to qualify the past six seasons.But the losing came with a reward. The Oilers have had the top overall pick in the last three N.H.L. entry drafts, selecting Hall (2010), Nugent-Hopkins (2011) and the Russian-born, Nail Yakupov (2012).Add to the mix a pair of 22-year-olds: Eberle, who led the Oilers with 76 points last season, and Schultz, the newly acquired defenseman who was sensational for the Barons this season, scoring 18 goals in 34 games.The Oilers finished the 2011-12 campaign with a 32-40-10 record, a seven-game improvement from the previous season.“We’ve had to go through such a transition in the last few years that now we’re finally in a spot where we’re able to see growth,” said Kevin Lowe, the Oilers’ president for hockey operations.They are off to a good start. Opening the season in Vancouver on Sunday, Edmonton clawed its way back from a 2-0 deficit to force overtime against a Canucks team that won last year’s President’s Trophy as the team with the most points. Ales Hemsky’s goal in the shootout cemented the Oilers’ opening night victory.After their home opener to the San Jose Sharks on Tuesday, they will get another test against a Western Conference power Thursday when they face the defending Stanley Cup champion Los Angeles Kings.The talent and chemistry of the young nucleus was apparent Sunday. Eberle scored Edmonton’s first goal off a crafty, backhand shot. Nugent-Hopkins, 19, and Hall, 21, led breaks and hit open teammates in scoring position.Schultz, an offensive-minded defenseman, showed his stick-handling skills when he pulled off a deft spin maneuver that left Vancouver’s Dale Weiss falling to the ice. Schultz also displayed an effective wrist shot.“He’s got a great shot and always finds a way to get it through, and for a defenseman, that’s rare,” said Nugent-Hopkins, who is also Schultz’s roommate.Yakupov, 19, was relatively quiet in his N.H.L. debut, finishing minus 2. There were flashes of his talent, but for he and the rest of the young players on the Oilers, the season will probably be a learning curve.“I think they have already meshed together; they’re all a little different,” Lowe said before the Vancouver game, noting that the group’s stint in Oklahoma City built camaraderie on and off the ice.“Taylor Hall didn’t have to go to the American Hockey League; he could have played in Europe, but he wanted to be with those young guys,” Lowe said.Expectations for the team to make the playoffs this season are especially high in northern Alberta. Not since the days of Gretzky, Mark Messier, Jari Kurri, Paul Coffey and Glenn Anderson has the organization had a nucleus with so much potential.“Comparison is a part of sports,” Gretzky said. “The answer is, if they become winners, then the comparisons are legitimate.”How quickly this new batch of Oilers can approach the franchise’s past successes remains to be seen. For now, they are still just a bunch of friends playing a game they love.“They seem immune to that sort of pressure,” Hrudey said. “Just watching them, they have a ton of fun playing and being around each other.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/baseball/marvin-miller-remembered-for-his-influence-on-baseball.html,"Among those who had gathered at Marvin Miller’s memorial at New York University on Monday were many players who owed their economic prosperity to him, labor lawyers who idolized him, and agents who owed their careers to him.He was remembered on Monday as the man who had helped baseball players gain their rights — among them free agency and a robust pension — and in doing so had revolutionized sports labor relations. Miller, who died on Nov. 27 at age 95 from liver cancer, became the executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Association in 1966, reconfigured the union and built it into the most powerful in sports and one of the most powerful labor bodies in the United States.“We’re here to honor, and this is not an exaggeration, a giant of American labor,” Michael Weiner, the association’s current executive director, said. “In our little own world of baseball, there’s no one that’s had as much influence in the last 50 years than Marvin Miller.”While Miller was the public face of the cause, many of the former players — including Hall of Famers Dave Winfield and Joe Morgan — recounted that he always reminded players that it was their union.“If we had searched 100 years, we couldn’t have found a more perfect individual for our situation,” Morgan said.About 400 people attended the memorial at Tishman Auditorium, and several used the opportunity to make the point that Miller belongs in the Hall of Fame. Miller has several times failed to get the necessary votes for induction from various veteran committees.The former Yankees pitcher Jim Bouton said it was unfair that Miller was not in the Hall of Fame, while the former baseball commissioner Bowie Kuhn, whom Miller fought against successfully for many years, had been inducted.“That’s like putting Wile E. Coyote in the Hall of Fame instead of the Road Runner,” Bouton said.Many former players fondly remembered the days sitting in the scorching sun at spring training camps in Arizona or Florida when they had first met Miller. In those early days, the relationship between the union and the owners was so contentious that Miller was not allowed to meet with the players inside the clubhouse as is the custom now. Instead, Miller and the players would meet in the outfield of one of the practice fields.Players recalled that Miller would outline strategy in the outfield in a whisper. Miller would use a soft voice when speaking in large groups so that players had to pay extra attention to hear.The general reaction upon first meeting Miller, many players would say, was disbelief. It was difficult for them to believe that they had just entrusted their futures to such a slight man, barely taller than a bat boy.“You’d have this impression of what he would look like,” the former infielder Phil Garner said. “I expected a bigger fella.”But undoubtedly, Miller became a giant in the sport. In his first year as head of the union, the minimum salary was $6,000 and the average salary was $19,000. When he retired in 1982, players’ salaries averaged $241,000.“The reason I think he is remembered as he is” said Donald Fehr, another former director of the union, whom Miller mentored, “is that the baseball players’ association became a symbol, it became a symbol of what a union could be if it was run right.”"

He retired in 1992 with 1,271 wins and never had a losing season.His legacy, however, may be what he did to promote the game.Fraser took over at Miami in 1963 with a $2,200 salary, a converted shower for an office and a cow pasture for a field.College baseball was not a revenue-generating sport, so Fraser got creative, raffling car batteries, presenting bikini nights, and offering nine-course meals on the infield of the team’s stadium.The efforts proved successful, as the Hurricanes became not only a winner on the field but also one of the best-known teams in college baseball.Fraser was named the N.C.A.A. coach of the year three times and coached numerous national teams, including the 1992 United States Olympic team.To save the baseball program from being cut in the early 1970s for budgetary reasons, Fraser called in favors. The Hall of Famer Stan Musial, the major league broadcaster Joe Garagiola and other notables showed up at a beach benefit banquet that impressed the university. In 1972, the university dropped basketball instead of baseball.Ronald George Fraser was born on June 25, 1933, in Nutley, N.J., and attended Florida State University.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/sports/golf/tiger-woods-to-make-2013-pga-tour-debut-on-familiar-ground.html,"SAN DIEGO — For somebody who has not lived in his native Southern California since 1996, Tiger Woods seems at home at Torrey Pines Golf Course, where he will make his 2013 PGA Tour debut this week at the Farmers Insurance Open.Torrey Pines is the site of 6 of Woods’s 74 PGA Tour victories and the site of perhaps the most memorable of his 14 major championships, the 2008 United States Open, where he prevailed in a Monday playoff while competing on a broken leg and a surgically repaired knee.After skipping the tournament last year to appear in a European Tour event in the United Arab Emirates, Woods is returning to an event in which his career scoring average is 68.62, almost four under par.Brandt Snedeker, the defending champion, said as he shook his head, “That’s just phenomenal,” he said, adding: “Anytime Tiger has a record, I put an asterisk by it, because it’s Tiger’s record. It’s not normal.”In his season-opening event in Abu Dhabi, Woods, a three-time tour winner in 2012, missed the cut after incurring a two-stroke penalty in the second round for an illegal drop. In some 30 years of competing, Woods said he could not remember being penalized for such an infraction.Woods, 37, knows he can bounce back from a slow start. He proved it at the United States Open here, overcoming first-hole scores of double bogey, bogey, double bogey, double bogey in the first four days to force a playoff with Rocco Mediate.Woods is his own harshest critic, but even he looks back with wonder at that victory, the most recent of his major titles. He pulled off some remarkable shots while in excruciating pain.“I don’t ever want to experience that again,” Woods said Tuesday, adding, “I really don’t know how I quite got through it.”He went on: “There were a lot of amazing things, but, man, here I am just talking about it and my hands are sweating just thinking about the feeling I had to get through each and every day. Just trying to get up and having to warm up again and go to the gym. I just don’t want to move. Then having to get out here and warm up and trying not to show you guys and any of my competitors what I was feeling. It was a very difficult week.”The North and South courses are playing faster this year, owing to a lack of rainfall, so they are not playing quite the same as Woods remembers. But still he said he felt comfortable here.For the first half of his life, Woods was the quintessential California kid. He was born in Orange County, in Cypress, and attended Stanford. He reminisced Tuesday about accompanying his father to this tournament, then known as the Andy Williams San Diego Open, while in grade school to watch California-bred professionals like Mark O’Meara, John Cook and Corey Pavin.As soon as Woods turned pro, he relocated to Florida, where there is no individual state income tax.In November, California voters approved Proposition 30, which imposed a 13.3 percent tax rate for incomes of more than $1 million, an increase over the previous “millionaires’ ” tax of 10.3 percent. At the Humana Challenge on Sunday, Phil Mickelson, a San Diego-area resident and the top earner in golf after Woods according to Forbes magazine, railed about his tax predicament and said he was faced with having to make “drastic changes” in his life.Asked if he cared to comment on Mickelson’s stance, Woods said: “Well, I moved out of here back in ’96 for that reason. I enjoy Florida, but also I understand what he was, I think, trying to say. I think he’ll probably explain it better and in more detail.”Mickelson is scheduled to hold a news conference Wednesday. On Monday night, he released a statement that read, in part: “Finances and taxes are a personal matter, and I should not have made my opinions on them public. I apologize to those I have upset or insulted and assure you I intend to not let it happen again.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/sports/football/nfl-football-roundup.html,"The game was played 10 years ago, but on Tuesday, the Super Bowl between the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and the Oakland Raiders was at the center of a stunning accusation, briefly supplanting the game that will be played in less than two weeks as the talk of the N.F.L.Tim Brown, a former receiver for the Oakland Raiders, alleged in a radio interview Saturday that Raiders Coach Bill Callahan purposefully “sabotaged” the team by changing the game plan just a few days before the game. The Raiders were trounced, 48-21, by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who had one of the best defenses in N.F.L. history.Callahan, who now works for the Dallas Cowboys, denied the accusation in statement Tuesday night, The Associated Press reported. Callahan said he was “shocked and saddened” by the accusation and said he always tried to win every game.In an interview Saturday on SiriusXM NFL Radio, Brown said the original game plan given to the team the Monday before the Super Bowl called for a run-heavy offensive attack, designed to take advantage of the Raiders’ size advantage on the offensive line.But Brown said Callahan stunned the team by changing the game plan to a pass-heavy approach — Brown said Callahan wanted to throw it 60 times — on the Friday before the game. Why? Brown claimed Callahan so hated the organization for which he worked that he wanted Coach Jon Gruden, who had left the Raiders for the Buccaneers after the previous season, to win the game instead.Brown was essentially accusing Callahan of trying to lose the game.“We all called it sabotage,” Brown said in the interview, adding, “because Callahan and Gruden were good friends.”Brown went on: “And Callahan had a big problem with the Raiders, you know, hated the Raiders. You know, only came because Gruden made him come. Literally walked off the field on us a couple of times during the season when he first got there, the first couple years.”On Tuesday, Jerry Rice, who was a teammate of Brown’s on that Raiders team, backed Brown’s account, telling ESPN, “Why would you wait to the last second to change the game plan?”In a later radio interview in Dallas, Brown seemed to backtrack a bit, saying he was only expressing his opinion, but he said that Callahan’s close relationship with Gruden and his disdain for the Raiders’ organization allowed people to reach the conclusion that Callahan might have lost the Super Bowl intentionally. Brown also said that he had been suggesting for years that Callahan tried to lose the game.The statistics from the game do not clear up the matter. The Raiders rushed only 11 times, and they attempted 44 passes. That was not an unusual figure for a team that trailed by 20-3 at halftime and one that averaged almost 39 pass attempts a game that season, and finished with the most passing yards in the league.Rich Gannon, the Raiders’ quarterback that season, said on SiriusXM NFL Radio that he believed Callahan wanted to win. And he said the ease of Tampa Bay’s win stemmed from the fact that the Raiders had not changed much of the offensive play calls after Gruden left.“In terms of Bill Callahan, let me just say this: He was a good football coach, he was a good man,” Gannon said Tuesday. “We all wanted to win.”He added: “So much of our verbiage and terminology was a carry-over from what Jon Gruden had installed in terms of our run checks, and so we were calling certain plays and guys like Warren Sapp and Derrick Brooks were calling out the runs. So it kind of took us out of our no-huddle plan at the line of scrimmage.”GARRETT LOSES A DUTY The Dallas Cowboys’ owner, Jerry Jones, said that Coach Jason Garrett would no longer call the plays on offense.Speaking to reporters at Senior Bowl practices in Mobile, Ala., Jones said Bill Callahan, the team’s offensive line coach, might inherit play-calling duties.Garrett told The Dallas Morning News and The Fort Worth Star-Telegram that he would welcome a switch.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/sports/football/david-akers-left-leg-has-the-49ers-crossing-their-fingers.html,"In this, the strangest season of his N.F.L. career, David Akers connected on a 63-yard field goal, nearly shanked his way out of employment in San Francisco, underwent treatment for a double hernia injury, received death threats on social media, shuttered his Twitter account and won a job competition that took place before the playoffs started.Some season.It will end about two weeks from now, in the ultimate triumph or perhaps the worst kind of defeat. It could end with the payoff Akers always hoped for, his first Super Bowl ring. Or it could end with another missed field goal in a season filled with far too many of them, a result that would live in ignominy for a kicker known for his reliability until 2012.As the 49ers prepare for Super Bowl XLVII, the franchise’s most important game in more than a decade, the body part that produces the most angst per pound is not the torn triceps tendon of defensive lineman Justin Smith, nor the right arm of the inexperienced young quarterback Colin Kaepernick.It is Akers’s left leg.On Monday, Coach Jim Harbaugh told reporters in San Francisco that “David Akers is our kicker” for the Super Bowl, a decision Harbaugh made early, perhaps to inspire confidence in either his kicker or his fan base, or even in himself. Yet his decisions over the past month spoke to a lack of confidence, not an abundance of it.The kick that typified Akers’s season took place Sunday, in the third quarter of the N.F.C. championship game against the Atlanta Falcons. The 49ers trailed by 3 points. Akers trotted onto the field, conducted his usual routine and sailed a 38-yard attempt toward the goal posts. The kick struck the left upright and bounced into the end zone below.Akers looked despondent. He sat on the bench and stared into space. His team scored another touchdown and rendered irrelevant the latest error from their kicker, who otherwise played well Sunday, with five kickoffs that went for touchbacks and four successful extra points.Afterward, Akers told The San Francisco Chronicle he was three inches from a perfect game, which is both true and precisely the point. Super Bowls have been, will be, decided by less.“This has been the toughest year for him,” Jerrold Colton, Akers’s agent, said Tuesday. “He hasn’t performed up to his usual standards. No one is harder on David than himself. By the same token, he still has tremendous confidence.”Akers made All-Pro in 2011 with a season among the best at his position. He set league records for field goals in one season (44) and points for a kicker (166). His successful attempt against the Giants tied the N.F.C. title game, which went into overtime. He did all this in his first year with San Francisco, the perfect revenge on the Philadelphia Eagles, who let him walk after 12 seasons. His two misses against Green Bay in the 2010 playoffs (41 and 29 yards) were a key reason for the Eagles 21-16 loss and perhaps why he was not retained.His charmed existence in San Francisco continued in the season opener this year, when his 63-yard try against Green Bay hit the crossbar — and still went between the uprights, tying an N.F.L. record. Not bad for a man who would turn 38 in December.Akers, in fact, converted his first six attempts. Then everything fell apart. He shanked kicks with alarming regularity, missed right and left and short, but left most often. He totaled 13 unsuccessful field-goal attempts in the regular season, good for his worst conversion rate (69 percent) since 1998.The question most pertinent to the Super Bowl is whether Akers’s struggles will change the 49ers’ strategy and if so, how? Their final regular-season contest, a home victory over Arizona, provided a small window into Harbaugh’s thinking.In that game, Akers missed two attempts. At one point, he threw his helmet on the sideline. The crowd booed him, starting before he missed anything. Harbaugh apparently shared their frustration, twice electing to attempt to convert on fourth-and-long in Arizona territory rather than let Akers perform a task central to his job description.After that game, Akers shut down his Twitter account (@DavidAkers2) after at least one irate fan threatened “miss one more field goal you about to get your life ended,” the sentence posted in all capital letters. He also told local reporters he had had double hernia surgery last February, an injury that flared up enough during the season that Akers said he went back to the doctor who performed the operation for treatment.Harbaugh signed Billy Cundiff before the playoff run, an odd decision, if only for the timing. Cundiff, after all, botched a field goal in last season’s A.F.C. championship game that would have forced overtime. He was playing for Baltimore, coached by Harbaugh’s brother and current Super Bowl coaching counterpart, John.The 49ers staged a kicking competition before their most crucial game of the season, kept Cundiff on the roster for their playoff win against Green Bay, then cut him before the Falcons game. Harbaugh’s actions did not indicate a high level of confidence in Akers, who only compounded the issue when his kick against Atlanta struck the upright.Now the 49ers are in the Super Bowl, with a formidable defense, a blossoming quarterback and an offensive line as good as any in the N.F.L. It is almost a complete team. Almost.Akers, of course, will continue with the mentality that carried him through 15 hazardous years, past dozens of challengers for his job, all the way to the most critical game of his career.“He believes the next kick is going through the uprights,” Colton said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/sports/hockey/brodeur-steady-as-ever-in-devils-home-opener.html,"NEWARK — Cries of “Let’s Go Devils!” were followed by an obscene chant repeatedly aimed at the rival Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday night, leaving no doubt the N.H.L. had returned to the Prudential Center after a 119-day lockout.The Devils acted as if they never left, celebrating their home opener with a convincing 3-0 victory that allowed goaltender Martin Brodeur to extend his record with the 120th regular-season shutout of his career. Brodeur, 40, flashed midseason form in making 24 saves even though he was inactive during the labor dispute.“I’ve worked really hard to get where I am,” Brodeur said. “The team is playing really well and I’m just trying to play hockey.”His teammates were hardly surprised to see him play so well so soon as he added to another mark with his 658th regular-season victory.“I think he will always be that guy,” right wing David Clarkson said. “He finds ways to impress you every year. It’s like he’s 20 again. He makes saves and you say, ‘How did he do that?’ ”It helped that the Devils, off to a quick 2-0 start after Saturday night’s 2-1 road win against the Islanders, produced another dominant performance against a Philadelphia team they dispatched in five games in last season’s Eastern Conference semifinals. The Devils went on to lose to the Los Angeles Kings in six games in the Stanley Cup finals.“It was disappointing,” right wing Ilya Kovalchuk said of the end of last season, “but we took a lot of positive things out of it.”The Devils’ offense was considered suspect after the team captain Zach Parise, an explosive scorer, departed as a free agent to play in his home state of Minnesota, signing a 13-year contract worth $98 million with the Wild.Lou Lamoriello, the Devils’ general manager, responded to that loss with a move halfway through last week’s six-day training camp that already looks to be another in a seemingly endless list of shrewd transactions. He locked up center Travis Zajac with the longest contract a team is allowed to offer one of its players under the new collective bargaining agreement. The eight-year deal totaled $46 million.Although a left Achilles’ injury limited Zajac to 15 games in the regular season last year, he emerged as a key figure in the playoffs with seven goals and seven assists. Zajac is continuing that strong play in the early going of the abbreviated 48-game schedule.He scored the Devils’ first goal of the season Saturday. He also was the first player to break through against Philadelphia, at 1 minute 7 seconds of the first period. Zajac was in perfect position, camped alone at the right side of the net, to bang home a rebound allowed by goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov.The Devils were lucky and good when Clarkson tallied with 24.9 seconds left in the first. Clarkson flipped the puck in front of Philadelphia’s net, where the Flyers’ Ruslan Fedotenko had it inadvertently carom off his skate past Bryzgalov for a power-play goal. The Devils led, 2-0, despite being outshot, 9-3, in the opening period.Bryzgalov was no match for Kovalchuk after Kovalchuk was awarded a penalty shot 2:44 into the second period. Kovalchuk bore down on the net and adroitly shifted the puck to his backhand to beat Bryzgalov. It was the third successful try for Kovalchuk in four career penalty shots, and it came short-handed.For now, it appears the Devils can find enough offense without Parise.“You just hope it’s going to happen all year because we are going to need guys to step up and fill that void,” Brodeur said. “We’re not a team that relies on one or two players. When we got to be successful last year, it was because the depth of our hockey team was present.”Clarkson said: “No one can replace Zach. We’re not in here saying, ‘Who is going to replace Zach Parise?’ We’re going to play our game. That’s all we can do.”And, as always, they will look to the seemingly ageless Brodeur."

Te’o claims he never met Kekua in person but developed a relationship with her through phone calls and electronic messages.“Katie, put yourself in my situation,” Te’o said in an interview to air Thursday on Couric’s syndicated talk show. “I, my whole world told me that she died on Sept. 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on Sept. 12.”“Now I get a phone call on Dec. 6, saying that she’s alive and then I’m going be put on national TV two days later” Te’o said. “And to ask me about the same question. You know, what would you do?”A segment of the interview with Te’o and his parents was broadcast on Wednesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”Te’o made at least three references to his girlfriend in news media interviews after Dec. 6.Te’o’s father defended his son when Couric pointed out that many people do not believe him, suspecting he used the situation for personal gain.“People can speculate about what they think he is,” Brian Te’o said with tears in his eyes. “I’ve known him 21 years of his life. And he’s not a liar. He’s a kid.”On Tuesday, the woman whose photo was used on the Twitter account of Te’o’s supposed girlfriend said the man allegedly behind the hoax confessed and apologized to her.The woman, Diane O’Meara, told NBC’s “Today” show that the supposed hoaxer, Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, used pictures of her without her knowledge in creating a fake woman called Lennay Kekua.Te’o told ESPN last week that Tuiasosopo had contacted him to apologize for the hoax soon after Deadpsin.com broke the news with a long report. Te’o told ESPN that not until Tuiasosopo confessed did he finally, fully realize Kekua did not exist.Tuiasosopo has not commented on the scheme.The top F.B.I. agent in northern Indiana said the authorities do not believe a crime was committed, so there is no investigation.“I don’t think there was any financial harm to Mr. Te’o,” said Robert Ramsey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s supervisory special agent for northern Indiana. “There was no federal violation regarding the Internet hoax perpetrated against Mr. Te’o.”If there had been a crime, Ramsey said, it would fall under federal jurisdiction."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/baseball/dodgers-and-time-warner-cable-near-deal-for-tv-channel.html,"Well before a group led by Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers for $2.15 billion last year from Frank McCourt, the team expected a financial windfall from its cable television rights.Now, that bonanza appears to be near.Time Warner Cable is expected to announce as soon as Thursday a deal with the Dodgers that would include creating a team-owned channel and paying the team a reported $7 billion over 20 to 25 years. Bloomberg first reported news of the pending agreement.The deal also needs a final agreement with Major League Baseball over how much of the money paid to the Dodgers by Time Warner Cable would be subject to local revenue sharing. Officials of the team and M.L.B. are expected to meet on Thursday.Dodgers and Time Warner officials declined to comment.The Dodgers’ deal differs from the one the N.B.A.’s Lakers have with Time Warner Cable, which is also worth billions of dollars over a long-term contract. Time Warner Cable owns the English- and Spanish-language regional sports networks that it created to carry the Lakers.Time Warner Cable plays two roles in the Los Angeles market, as its dominant cable TV operator and as a newly aggressive sports network owner. Even at steep prices, the Dodgers and Lakers deals give Time Warner Cable cost certainty for its cable systems and end the need to negotiate agreements over monthly subscriber fees with Fox. The Lakers were formerly on the Fox Sports West network. The Dodgers will finish their contract with Fox-owned Prime Ticket after the 2013 season.Fox is not expected to use the rights in its Dodgers contract to match the Time Warner Cable offer.In November, News Corporation, Fox’s parent, gained a significant television foothold outside Los Angeles when it acquired 49 percent of the YES Network, the Yankees’ channel, with an option to buy up to 80 percent in three years."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/football/junior-seaus-family-sues-nfl.html,"The family of Junior Seau, a former star linebacker who shot and killed himself last year, sued the N.F.L., the helmet maker Riddell and others on Wednesday, accusing them of hiding information about the link between head hits and long-term cognitive issues.The family said the league not only “propagated the false myth that collisions of all kinds, including brutal and ferocious collisions, many of which lead to short-term and long-term neurological damage to players, are an acceptable, desired and natural consequence of the game,” but also that “the N.F.L. failed to disseminate to then-current and former N.F.L. players health information it possessed” about the risks associated with brain trauma.Seau’s family, which filed the case in state court in San Diego, is seeking an unspecified amount of compensatory and punitive damages.Seau was 43 when he shot himself in the chest at his home in California in May. He played 20 seasons in the N.F.L. with the San Diego Chargers, the Miami Dolphins and the New England Patriots. This month the National Institutes of Health said tissue samples from Seau’s brain showed that he had chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or C.T.E., a degenerative brain disease linked to repeated head hits and brain trauma.“We were saddened to learn that Junior, a loving father and teammate, suffered from C.T.E.,” Seau’s family said in a statement after its complaint was filed. “We know this lawsuit will not bring back Junior. But it will send a message that the N.F.L. needs to care for its former players, acknowledge its decades of deception on the issue of head injuries and player safety, and make the game safer for future generations.”Greg Aiello, a spokesman for the N.F.L., said the league’s lawyers would “respond to the claims appropriately through the court.”The N.F.L. has often asked courts to move these cases to federal court in Philadelphia, where similar complaints have been consolidated. More than 4,000 retired N.F.L. players and their family members, including those of Ray Easterling and Dave Duerson, who also committed suicide, have similar cases pending there.The N.F.L. has asked that the cases be dismissed, arguing that the league’s collective bargaining agreement with its players covers these issues."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/football/a-month-after-the-ravens-fired-him-cam-cameron-understands.html,"LUTHERVILLE, Md. — The day he lost his job, Cam Cameron decided to go to his son Danny’s high school basketball game. As soon as Cameron arrived at the gymnasium, he could sense that people were staring at him. It struck him as pity, or perhaps morbid curiosity.“People were numb because they think you should run and hide,” he said. “They think you’re embarrassed. I’ve got nothing to be embarrassed about.”Until Dec. 10, Cameron occupied a high-profile position as the offensive coordinator of the Baltimore Ravens. Then he was fired, and the Ravens began to thrive without him. The team’s remarkable postseason run will culminate in a Super Bowl appearance against the San Francisco 49ers.Some in the punditry business have cited Cameron’s firing as a catalyst for the team’s success. If you think this annoys him, think again.“It was a brilliant move,” Cameron said Wednesday at his home outside Baltimore. “Everyone on the team took a look in the mirror after that.”Cameron, 51, said he learned long ago that being fired was part of football. At this stage of his career, he has a dispassionate view of his profession. In his den, he has a framed photograph of his stepfather, Tom Harp, when he was an assistant coach at Army in 1958. In the photo, Harp is standing next to Earl Blaik, the legendary coach known as Red, and Pete Dawkins, the Heisman Trophy-winning halfback. Army went undefeated that season.Harp later worked as a head coach at Cornell, Duke and Indiana State, with varying degrees of success. Cameron said he could remember when his stepfather was fired for the first time. “As a kid, you live it,” he said.The demands on coaches — to win, and win now — have only grown in recent years, Cameron said. He said coaches once viewed preseason games as opportunities to work on fundamentals and evaluate young players — nothing more.“Now, after one preseason game, people are wanting to know what’s wrong with the offense,” he said.Cameron has had his share of success. An acolyte of the longtime coach Don Coryell, whose high-octane passing attack continues to influence the modern game, Cameron directed one of the highest-scoring offenses in N.F.L. history in 2006 with the San Diego Chargers. After one dismal season as the head coach of the Miami Dolphins, he joined the Ravens as the offensive coordinator in 2008 and helped Joe Flacco develop into one of the league’s top young quarterbacks.This season, the Ravens’ offense was not exactly scuffling with Cameron at the helm. When he was dismissed, the team was 9-4, having lost two straight games, and averaging 344.4 yards of offense. Under Jim Caldwell, who was promoted from quarterbacks coach, the Ravens have averaged 406.2 yards — including 424.7 yards per game in the playoffs. Cameron said the change made a difference — not so much because of any schematic overhauls, but because it put everyone in the organization on alert.“We were inconsistent,” Cameron said, “and if I’m in charge, I’m saying: ‘Why are we inconsistent? We need to get the team’s attention.’ ”As center Matt Birk put it, “It’s not like we changed everything we were doing.”On Dec. 10, the day after the Ravens lost to the Washington Redskins in overtime, Cameron arrived at the team’s practice facility at 4 a.m. — about an hour earlier than usual, he said. He could tell something was brewing, he said, though nobody had told him anything.“You can tell in decision-makers’ eyes, in their body language,” Cameron said.Coach John Harbaugh invited Cameron to meet in his office. The conversation was brief, Cameron said, with Harbaugh essentially telling Cameron that the team needed to make a change. Harbaugh later called it his most difficult decision as a head coach.Cameron said he told Harbaugh that he understood. The two men hugged, and Cameron said he wished Harbaugh luck before leaving the building.With time on his hands, Cameron pieced together a list of activities that he never had the chance to do while he was pulling 16-hour days as a coach. He drove his three youngest children to school. (His oldest, Tom, is a freshman at Fordham.) He went to the gym with his wife, Missy. He golfed. He fished. He took a bowhunting trip to Ohio with his 14-year-old son, Chris. “I said, ‘I want to see what all this feels like,’ ” Cameron recalled.When he visited New York with his wife to see a couple of Broadway shows, he could feel the sting of unemployment beginning to fade, he said. He found an Irish pub where he watched the Ravens’ divisional playoff victory over the Denver Broncos. He said he had invested too much in the team to let himself feel bitter or unhappy. “You can’t do anything but root for those guys,” he said.He wants to coach again, he said, and plans to next season. He still loves the game. He interviewed with the Jets for their offensive coordinator position, but was turned down. “When you’re in this situation,” Cameron said, “you have to build yourself up a little bit.”He recalled the message that linebacker Ray Lewis gave the Ravens after their playoff loss to the Patriots last season.“He said we were right where we were supposed to be,” Cameron said. “I believed that then, and I believe it today. I don’t necessarily understand it. But I believe that me and my family — and I’ve told them this — we’re right where we’re supposed to be. And that’s very freeing in a lot of ways.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/soccer/for-jurgen-klinsmann-a-world-cup-ahead-and-a-us-team-in-progress.html,"TORRANCE, Calif. — There will not be any excuses for the United States men’s national soccer team should it fail to qualify for the next World Cup. Entrance, of course, can never be guaranteed. But if the Americans are not competing in Brazil a year and a half from now, it will be through their own malfunction.At least that is how their coach seems to see things.“I’m not afraid of any of those teams,” Jurgen Klinsmann said Tuesday, sitting in a hotel lobby a short drive from the Home Depot Center, where he has orchestrated the team’s January training camp. “I’m not afraid of Mexico at all.”Klinsmann can be an engaging orator, going on and on without prodding on a range of subjects, like how he views his team: “I’m telling you, if I go player by player through both teams — and this is not just because I’m a very positive thinking person, it’s because I evaluate players — I’m telling you that we’ve got to go into Mexico City to beat them in front of 100,000 people,” he said.His point was that his team, despite what the current FIFA rankings suggest, was the best in its region, and as it prepared for the final round of World Cup qualifying — beginning Feb. 6 in Honduras, and continuing through the year with home-and-away matches against Costa Rica, Panama, Jamaica, and rival Mexico — the biggest threat was the absence of focus or desire or overall mental fortitude.Klinsmann continued: “They have Chicharito? We have Clint Dempsey. They have Guardado? We have Michael Bradley.”But then came his other point: “It’s all here,” he said, pointing to his head. “There is a lot of work still ahead of us.”Klinsmann, 48, has been the United States’ head coach since July 2011. From the standpoint of results, the past calendar year was a clear success. The team went 9-2-3, earning impressive victories in Mexico (the first there in team history) and Italy (also the first time) and grinding out a draw in Russia.But in his mind his team’s most glaring misstep, a surprising 2-1 loss in Kingston, Jamaica, was equally important.“We didn’t lose in Jamaica because Jamaica was playing better than we did,” Klinsmann said. “We lost because we didn’t have the right focus. We gave away cheap free kicks, and they scored two goals out of nothing. They didn’t have any chance during the game. Not even one chance. But we lost.”Klinsmann often adopts the rhetorical style of a life coach, a role he seems to embrace, and one of his chief concerns since he took over 16 months ago has been raising his players’ personal standards. He does not hesitate, whether in interviews or behind closed doors, to suggest the best career move for any player, assuming his goal is to succeed on the national team.Klinsmann does not dispute the view that soccer’s uphill climb to popularity in the United States has precluded the country from producing an elite team. Yet he feels his team can compete in the short term against the world’s best, making up some of the difference through more holistic measures, like fitness and psychology.Those who spend some time observing Klinsmann, then, might notice his fondness for the term “24/7,” which seems to represent his highest form of praise for a professional and a state of being to strive toward.“When you talk about 24/7, it’s that you’re accountable for what you eat, accountable for how you sleep, how you live your life, how serious you take your job,” he said. “You’re accountable for what you do with your money, choosing your agent, choosing your girlfriend or your wife. Ultimately, it will all affect your performance.”He elaborated another way: if you’re a player, one beer at night might be O.K. Two? That is your choice, but you should think about it. And if you are the type who goes for three, maybe you are not cut out for the national team.Accountability is another of Klinsmann’s buzz words, and he said it was a shame that his players did not experience persistent and harsh scrutiny from the news media and fans, the way their international counterparts do. He feels some American players are too easily satisfied with their accomplishments.Such policing, for now, will have to be done from the inside.During a morning training session this week, Martin Vasquez, one of the team’s assistant coaches, was the one ensconced among the players, yelling instruction and encouragement, revolving his body like a turret. Klinsmann orbited slowly around them all, mostly quiet.But Klinsmann came alive during the final drill, one that pitted two teams of five against each other on a truncated field. He watched intently from the sideline, his feet spread apart, his fingers curled tensely at his sides.The players were moving languidly, and Klinsmann stopped the action. “This is a game that shows your character,” he said of the drill. “This is a game to get nasty.”The impromptu speech then closed with a flourish, with Klinsmann scolding the players for not getting on one another’s cases. “If you see someone here that doesn’t want to win,” he said, shouting at this point, “it should make you very mad,” injecting an expletive for emphasis.Such lectures, as well as countless words of encouragement, have been common at this month’s training camp, which has been populated almost entirely by young, domestic-based players.But when the team’s Europe-based players, the ones who will be relied upon for the coming qualifiers, re-enter the picture, Klinsmann will have another set of concerns. He mentioned, for instance, the possibility that those playing for glamorous clubs overseas might have lost the stomach for the scrappier battles that define regional games.It is all part of the mixing and matching that Klinsmann will have to oversee.“I see here an environment where there’s a lot happening within a short amount of time, and that’s why that layer, the foundation, will still be defined over the next 12 to 14 months,” he said, adding: “It’s fun. I really enjoy it. But you’ve got to prove it at the end of the day at the World Cup.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/golf/phil-mickelson-takes-a-mulligan-on-tax-comments.html,"SAN DIEGO — Three days after creating a firestorm with his public airing of his tax grievances, Phil Mickelson apologized for being, well, himself.“You know,” he said Wednesday when asked what the past 72 hours have been like, “I’ve made some dumb, dumb mistakes, and obviously, talking about this stuff was one of them.”After his final round Sunday at the Humana Challenge, Mickelson said, “There are going to be some drastic changes for me because I happen to be in that zone that has been targeted both federally and by the state.”On Wednesday, Mickelson, speaking on the eve of the Farmers Insurance Open, likened the airing of his postelection frustrations to the intemperance he displayed on No. 18 at Winged Foot Golf Club during the final round of the 2006 United States Open.Ahead by one as he walked to the tee box, Mickelson hit a drive that caromed off a hospitality tent far left of the fairway. He compounded his error by trying to cut a shot around a tree instead of hitting back onto the fairway. The ball ricocheted off the trunk, sending him on his way to a double-bogey 6 that handed the victory to Geoff Ogilvy.“I hit a drive way left off the tents,” Mickelson joked. “So this happened to be way right, but way off the tents.”He added: “Like Winged Foot, where I tried to carve a three-iron around a tree and get it up by the green, I make double bogey and lose the U.S. Open, I think I’m going to learn my lesson and take a wedge and get it back in play.”But Mickelson, who has more than $67 million in career earnings, digressed.“I think that it was insensitive to talk about it publicly to those people who are not able to find a job, that are struggling paycheck to paycheck,” he said.He added, “My apology is for talking about it publicly because I shouldn’t take advantage of the forum that I have as a professional golfer to try to ignite change over these issues.”It was suggested that with his high profile, he is the ideal agent of change. “Possibly,” Mickelson said after a long pause. “I don’t think that it’s necessarily me.”"

The Jets ranked 30th in overall offense and averaged 17.5 points per game.Sparano, who will be entering his 30th year coaching, was the head coach of the Miami Dolphins for four years before being fired in December 2011.PAYTON BACK TO WORK New Orleans Coach Sean Payton returned to work after serving a nearly yearlong suspension.N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell lifted Payton’s suspension Tuesday, nearly two weeks earlier than expected. On Wednesday, Payton watched the Senior Bowl practices, and he planned to meet later in the day with his staff to evaluate the Saints’ defense, which struggled during a 7-9 season.Payton said during a 45-minute meeting with reporters that he and Goodell agreed not to discuss specifics about whether there was an organized bounty system.“We’re at a point where it’s time for closure,” Payton said. “It’s time for us as a team, it’s time for us as a league, to take this next step forward.”He characterized his relationship with Goodell as “very good” and said their four-and-a-half-hour meeting on Monday included topics like player safety, youth football and the current crop of quarterbacks.Payton watched the Senior Bowl’s North squad practice from the stands, chatting with the Saints’ assistant head coach, Joe Vitt, and General Manager Mickey Loomis.The N.F.L. suspended Payton, Vitt, Loomis and four players after an investigation found the Saints had a performance pool offering cash rewards for key plays, including big hits. The player suspensions were eventually overturned.Payton said he was not involved in the appeals process.The former defensive coordinator Gregg Williams remains suspended indefinitely. Payton said he had not spoken to Williams, adding, “I have no interest in talking to Gregg.”NOT COMMITTING TO WEEDEN Rob Chudzinski, the Browns’ new coach, said it was “premature” to name Brandon Weeden Cleveland’s starting quarterback for the 2013 season.At a news conference to introduce Norv Turner as his offensive coordinator, Chudzinski would not commit to Weeden, 29, who had an uneven rookie season after he was drafted in the first round in April.Chudzinski indicated he had been too busy hiring his assistants to judge what he was inheriting, which is why he would not pencil Weeden in as the starter.Like Chudzinski, Turner would not offer a strong opinion, positive or negative, on Weeden but said Weeden had some intangibles to build on.DESCRIBING RATLIFF ARREST The police said Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Jay Ratliff did not seem drunk after they pulled him over this week. Ratliff was arrested on suspicion of driving while intoxicated.Ratliff did not immediately give off the smell of alcohol and did not look drunk after a late-night accident Tuesday in Grapevine, about 20 miles northwest of Dallas, according to search warrant paperwork released Wednesday. He was arrested after failing a field sobriety test.Police Officer Eric Barch wrote in a search warrant affidavit that he wanted to investigate further because the accident happened shortly after midnight.GORE IS FINED OVER SOCKS San Francisco 49ers running back Frank Gore was fined $10,500 by the N.F.L. for wearing his socks too low in Sunday’s N.F.C. championship game at Atlanta, an equipment violation."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/baseball/trade-brings-upton-brothers-together-with-braves.html,"So many things must align just right for brothers to play on the same major league team, at the same time, at roughly the same skill level. Ask Larry Reynolds, the agent for Justin and B. J. Upton, now united in the outfield of the Atlanta Braves.Larry and his brothers, Don and Harold, all played professional baseball. Don played two seasons in the majors and retired before the start of Harold’s 12-year career. Larry played six years in the minors. The brothers overlapped professionally for just one season, but they always wondered how it would have felt to be teammates.“We thought about it,” Larry Reynolds said. “That would have been great. But this is probably as close to a baseball dream come true as you can get. They’re both excited about it, and they’ll play well together.”Reynolds has represented the Upton brothers since they entered professional baseball, B. J. as the second overall pick of the 2002 draft, Justin as the first pick three years later. Until this winter, they had never changed teams. B. J. Upton helped the Tampa Bay Rays to three playoff berths, and Justin Upton helped the Arizona Diamondbacks to two.Now they have moved on together. Early this off-season, while negotiating with the Braves on a five-year, $75.25 million contract, center fielder B. J. Upton told General Manager Frank Wren how much he would love to play with his brother someday. By then, Wren said, he had already learned that the Diamondbacks were shopping Justin Upton and the three years left on his contract.“We’ve been looking for that young, dynamic, power-hitting outfielder who can hit in the middle of the lineup and make the other team think a little bit,” Wren said Thursday, after dealing five players for Upton and infielder Chris Johnson. “So we’re really excited.”As Wren’s new left fielder, Upton shares the feeling. He signed a six-year, $51.25 million contract extension with Arizona in March 2010, five months before Diamondbacks hired a new general manager, Kevin Towers. While Upton starred in 2011 (.289, 31 homers, 88 runs batted in), he had been dogged by trade rumors ever since.The Diamondbacks finally acted on Thursday, getting infielder-outfielder Martin Prado, starter Randall Delgado and three prospects. Upton, 25, got a welcomed jolt to a career that is just developing. His production declined (.280, 17 homers, 67 R.B.I.) as he played through a thumb injury last season, but now he will play with his brother for the first time in more than 10 years, since a fall travel team in Virginia called the Tidewater Mets.“I was the low man on the totem pole,” Justin Upton said. “We had Ryan Zimmerman, David Wright, all those guys. I hardly ever saw the field. Those guys were preparing to be minor-league ballplayers; I was just happy to be out there.”In the major leagues, Justin Upton reached the playoffs first, in 2007. When B. J. Upton made the World Series the next year, his brother watched from the stands, shivering in the cold and rain in Philadelphia. Last August, when Justin Upton hit his 100th career home run, his brother reached the same milestone in a different ballpark less than an hour later.They have routinely texted each other if they noticed something while watching from afar. Now, they will be side by side in the field and maybe in the lineup.“Being able to show up to the ballpark with my brother, being excited to be there every day — the more energy you can bring to the yard every day, that’s going to make you a better player,” Justin Upton said. “Having someone you’re comfortable with, that will help a lot.”Baseball has a long history of brotherly teammates. The Dean brothers — Dizzy and Paul — combined for all four Cardinals victories in the 1934 World Series. Around the same time, Paul and Lloyd Waner, nicknamed Big Poison and Little Poison, were starring for the Pirates on their way to the Hall of Fame.More typically, though, brothers have different levels of talent. Felipe Alou was a regular for the Giants in 1963 and played three games in the outfield with his brothers, Jesus and Matty, that September. On the final day of the 1998 season, the Reds used a starting infield of the Boone brothers (Aaron and Bret) and the Larkin brothers (Barry and Stephen, in his only career game). Five years later, Mets first baseman Mike Glavine got his only career start in a game pitched by his brother, Tom.Some of the greatest Braves have been teammates with a brother, from Joe and Frank Torre to Hank and Tommie Aaron to Phil and Joe Niekro. The knuckleballing Niekros played together in Atlanta in 1973 and 1974, and again for the Yankees in 1985.“We roomed together; we went to the ballpark together; we ate together — breakfast, lunch and dinner,” Phil Niekro said on Thursday. “We just did everything together. If you saw Joe, you saw me. We were like twins.”The best part, Niekro said, was how much it meant to their parents. It was a considerable source of pride, of course — and much more convenient.“Most mothers and fathers could only dream of one of their boys going to the big leagues and playing,” Niekro said. “You spend so many hours on car rides, at Little League games and high school and maybe college. Then all of a sudden, you’ve got two, so you can double all those hours. Now you get to go to one ballpark and see them both play.”Reynolds said the Uptons’ parents, Manny and Yvonne, would visit their sons often. The brothers, he said, have not decided if they will live together during the season. They are still trying to process their luck.“Now that it’s a reality, we’re both just happy,” Justin Upton said. “It’s kind of surreal right now.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/football/parents-of-jim-and-john-harbaugh-talk-about-sons-inherited-traits.html,"The Harbaugh family is highly competitive, but its members are also known for fierce loyalty. Both traits were on display Thursday during a conference call with Jack and Jackie Harbaugh, the parents of Jim and John, who coach the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens and will face each other in the Super Bowl on Feb. 3.A caller identified as “John from Baltimore” raised their ire by asking, “Is it true that both of you like Jim better than John?”After several unintelligible noises, Joani Crean, the sister of the Harbaugh brothers, calmed her parents by pointing out that it sounded as if her brother had been pulling a trick on them.“Mom was ready to come right through this phone!” Jack said, laughing. “I’m so happy that Joani recognized your voice.”John replied: “That’s the fighting spirit. That’s all I needed to know. I just needed to hear that.”The Harbaughs are the first brothers to be N.F.L. head coaches and are now the first to face off in a Super Bowl. Although the situation may be unique, they have always measured themselves against each other, having grown up the sons of a man who spent 43 years coaching football.The competitiveness and the intensity that the brothers display come from both of their parents. But Jim’s tendency to break out antiquated sayings is clearly something he shares with his father.Asked where the Harbaugh brothers might have learned one of their favorite sayings, about not taking any wooden nickels, Jack said that he did not really know what the phrase meant.It entered the family lexicon during a particularly dreary drive to school, when Jack felt the boys needed to hear something inspirational.“So we told them: ‘Attack this day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind. And don’t take any wooden nickels,’ ” Jack recalled.He continued, “That wooden nickel thing came from my dad, and I have no idea what a wooden nickel is, and I have no idea what that means, but it sounded like a pretty neat thing to say.”The brothers also picked up their ability to make a tough decision from Jack, who prides himself on having made a number of difficult ones over his career, even if none were as high profile as Jim’s decision to bench Alex Smith in favor of Colin Kaepernick or John’s decision to fire his offensive coordinator midseason.“When those decisions were made, I reflected on my own career, and I think that’s what coaching is all about,” Jack said. “That’s what leadership is all about. Every single day in coaching in the 43 years I was in it, there was a decision to be made, and there was a right way to do it, and there was a wrong way to do it.”The brothers’ big hearts, however, came from their mother.“The rock of our family is Jackie, and there’s no question about it,” Jack said. “She did all the heavy lifting.”As was the case before their regular-season meeting last season, the brothers have put their parents in quite a bind as far as rooting is concerned, but the parents have stated repeatedly that they intend to remain neutral.“I know one is going to win, and I know one is going to lose,” Jackie said. “But I’d like it to end in a tie.”As for the debate over whether the game should be called the Harbaugh Bowl, the HarBowl or some other variant, the parents did not see the point of making the game more about their sons than it already is.“I prefer for it to be called the Super Bowl,” Jackie said.And when the game is over, and one of the brothers has won and the other has lost, their parents will be there for both of them."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/football/jets-introduce-general-manager-john-idzik.html,"FLORHAM PARK, N.J. — At 11 a.m. Thursday, the Jets’ owner Woody Johnson introduced John Idzik, the team’s new general manager, at a news conference. It was Idzik’s first official day at the training center. He met employees at an organizational welcome breakfast in the cafeteria. He also had Rex Ryan show him where his office was. It was unclear if Idzik was kidding.At 2:08 p.m., a message was posted to @Revis24, the Twitter feed of Darrelle Revis, the Jets’ superlative but injured cornerback. It read, “I’m speechless by far but more importantly I feel more upset for the jet nation for having to go through this!!!” Less than a minute later, another message: “I guess we’ll see how this plays out.”Idzik accepted the position last Friday, after a comprehensive 19-day search for Mike Tannenbaum’s replacement, and did so cognizant of all the challenges that awaited him. His first, of about a few dozen, arrived in full force Thursday, amid reports that Johnson intends to explore trading Revis rather than extend his deal beyond the 2013 season, when the contract voids, thus making him a free agent.Idzik said it was “way premature” to assess Revis’s situation because he had spent “literally hours” at the facility and, after attending three days of Senior Bowl practices with the scouting staff in Mobile, Ala., has yet to evaluate the roster. Johnson, asked several times about Revis in a session with reporters, neither confirmed his desire nor denied it. He deferred to Idzik.“You can’t say anything definitive about anybody,” Johnson said.This is life around the Jets. Another day, another minicrisis. This one happens to involve their best player, the object of Ryan’s affections, the centerpiece of their defensive system. On his way to 1 Jets Drive on Thursday morning, Ryan started to laugh because, he said of Idzik, “it’s his first day in the building and this is what comes up.”The season ended not even a month ago.Already the Jets have overhauled almost their entire coaching staff. They have absorbed the public-relations fallout of delaying their season-ending news conference — while Ryan vacationed in the Bahamas, where he was photographed wearing a tattoo of his wife wearing a No. 6 Mark Sanchez jersey. And they have hired a man, in Idzik, whose 20 seasons in the N.F.L. — including the last six in Seattle, where he served as the Seahawks’ vice president of football administration — have steeled him for a job that, at bottom, ranks among the most difficult in the N.F.L.And this is even with Revis at full capacity, his knee stable, satisfied with his status, secure with his contract.  How Idzik proceeds with Revis, who is unlikely to remain a bargain after receiving $3 million in base salary for 2013 (and an additional $3 million in easily attainable bonuses), will help determine the course of the franchise. Extending the contract of Revis, who earlier this month said he “definitely” wants to remain with the Jets as he recovers from a serious knee injury, would show faith that he could regain his form as the N.F.L.’s top cornerback. Trading him would cost the Jets an elite player and a fan favorite, but it would also provide them with cap relief and financial flexibility, as well as, presumably, draft picks that would help Idzik restock a roster lacking in quality and depth.“The draft,” Idzik said, “will be very important to us.”Idzik also said little to distance the organization from its epic failure of a 2012 season, which ended with three consecutive losses, a quarterback controversy that ensnared three players and the image of the franchise in disrepair.“I don’t deal much with perception, to be honest; I deal with reality,” Idzik said. “And the reality here is I think this is one of the most fabulous infrastructures anyone could ask for.”He must resolve the Jets’ quarterback mess — the misguided contract extension for Sanchez, the misguided trade for Tim Tebow. He must also determine — be that 11 months from now, or earlier — whether to retain Ryan or pick his own coach. Idzik deflected a question whether Ryan, whom he called accomplished, energetic and engaging, must lead what will be a revamped team to the playoffs to save his job.“That’s a collaborative decision between John and I,” Johnson said. “John will certainly have something to say.”Later, perhaps. It was only Idzik’s first day in the building. He had more pressing matters to deal with.EXTRA POINTSRex Ryan said he hired Marty mornhinweg, who favors a West Coast-style passing offense, as offensive coordinator because he wanted someone with experience calling plays and in developing quarterbacks. “I can’t wait to get out there and see how our offense looks,” Ryan said. “Will it look different? Yes it will.” Ryan also said that Mornhinweg’s arrival should energize Mark Sanchez, of whom he said, “I believe Mark needs to erase his hard drive.” ... David Lee, who spent last season as Buffalo’s quarterbacks coach, joined the Jets in the same capacity."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/golf/north-course-is-shortest-route-to-top-of-leader-board-at-torrey-pines.html,"SAN DIEGO — The Farmers Insurance Open is the golfing equivalent of a 400-meter race, an onerous aerobic test with a staggered start that makes it hard to pick out the pacesetter at Torrey Pines. The Thursday leader board was top-heavy with players who teed off on the North Course, which at last year’s event played to an average that was 2.8 strokes easier than the South layout.Led by Brandt Snedeker, who opened defense of his title with a seven-under-par 65, eight of the day’s top-10 scores were posted on the North Course. K. J. Choi produced the lowest round on the harder course, a 65 that was nearly matched by Tiger Woods, a six-time champion in this event who bogeyed two of his final four holes for a 68.“I’m happy with it either way,” Woods said of his round, in which he hit 7 fairways and 13 greens and finished with 27 putts. “I made a few mistakes out there, but I made some nice plays as well.”Snedeker’s bogey-free round was no great surprise. This is his seventh start here, and his running score is a minus 52. Nor was it stunning to see Charles Howell III, who started on the 10th hole of the North Course, one stroke back. In Howell’s all-out bid to qualify for his hometown tournament, the Masters, he has strung together nine consecutive sub-70 rounds.Then there was Mike Weir, whose 66 on the North Course in overcast conditions was like a ray of sunshine burning through the gray clouds that have darkened his game for two years.Weir, a Canadian who won the Tour Championship in 2001 and the Masters two years later, has not made a cut in his last 18 starts dating to July 2011. An elbow injury led to bad swing habits that rocked his confidence, but Weir has recently seen glimmers of hope.He was on the cut line last week at the Humana Challenge until he made a triple bogey on his final hole. Weir hit 2 of 14 fairways Thursday but showed the precision of a pool hustler on the greens. He took 24 putts, three fewer than Snedeker.“My putter was just really hot,” Weir said. “That’s kind of the story today.” He added, “You do want to get off to a good start when you start on the North Course because you know the South is very difficult.”Weir’s slump has been a depressing narrative for him to repeat week after week. He described the past two years as “trying.” Asked what has kept him going, he said: “I love the game. I love to compete. Even as poor as I was playing, I knew it was in there. I still have the desire to play.”When golfers talk of their sport, they often sound as if they are struck in an unhealthy relationship. Howell, a two-time tour winner, said, “Anybody that says that golf is fun or whatever has really not done it for a living.”Elaborating, Howell said, “It’s awfully challenging mentally, and the chances to win are what we want.”Howell described contending as “addicting” and said, “It isn’t what you would call fun in the essence of, Hey, I’m going to go scuba dive today, and it’s 88 degrees outside and let’s have fun.”Golf is not a day at the beach, Weir agreed, even at Torrey Pines, with its sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean. “If you’re shooting six under or six over, it’s kind of the same mental grind,” Weir said, adding, “Very rarely in my career do you go through a round that feels easy.”Snedeker, whose victory here last year was the springboard that helped vault him to the FedEx Cup title, is playing with a confidence that is like a shield of armor, protecting him from the bruises the game can inflict.“It’s just a matter of when you’re comfortable on the golf course, and something doesn’t go your way or you get off to a slow start, you never get out of your routine and you never lose patience,” Snedeker said. He added: “Out here I seem to never do that. I always feel like my next good break is right around the corner, or my next good swing is around the corner, and it bleeds into my game.”The last time Snedeker panicked on a golf course? It was in October, after the last putt had fallen in the United States team’s loss to Europe in the Ryder Cup. Snedeker’s wife, Mandy, who was pregnant with the couple’s second child, was experiencing contractions during the final day but kept the news from him until after the closing ceremony.“And then he got a little worried,” said Snedeker’s wife, who delivered the couple’s son, Austin Jones, a few days later."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/hockey/flyers-hang-on-to-top-rangers.html,"PHILADELPHIA — After one night’s respite, the Rangers are back in a funk. They lost here Thursday to the Flyers, a team that was winless in three games this season and that entered the evening missing three of its key players.The score was 2-1, the Rangers’ record dropped to 1-3 and their eight-game winning streak against the Flyers, which dated to March 6, 2011, was stopped.No surprise, then, that Coach John Tortorella was irritated.“That’s a stupid question,” Tortorella snapped when asked if the Rangers were in good shape. “This team is in shape as far as what we’ve started with here, as far as how it’s happened with the lockout. That’s just a dumb question.”The Rangers were listless through the first two periods and fell behind, 2-0, after goals by Wayne Simmonds and Jakub Voracek. They drew within one when Taylor Pyatt buried a setup from Marian Gaborik on a power play 1 minute 39 seconds into the third period. It was Pyatt’s third goal in as many games.But they could not connect on a five-on-three advantage that lasted 1:59 midway through the third period, or on an additional one-man advantage for the two minutes immediately after.Gone was the magic the Rangers’ first line provided at Madison Square Garden in a 4-3 overtime win over Boston on Wednesday, when Gaborik had a hat trick and Brad Richards and Rick Nash shredded the Bruins’ defense.On Thursday in Philadelphia, those three players managed only three shots on Flyers goalie Ilya Bryzgalov. Henrik Lundqvist was the Rangers’ best player, preventing a blowout as the Rangers were outshot by 33-19.Lundqvist said it was the best game he had played this season, but he added, “In the end you want to get the win to feel good about yourself.”Tortorella was definitely not feeling good about his team Thursday night.“We’re certainly not getting enough big plays from our top guys in that situation,” Tortorella said about the failure to score on the five-on-three, and about the game in general. “Our top line simply didn’t play well tonight, Gaby, Richie and Nasher.”Tortorella said the Rangers’ problem on the failed power play was that they were “too deliberate.”Defenseman Michael Del Zotto, who plays the point on the first power-play unit, amplified his coach’s comment.“It’s almost as if we make our setup, and we’re stuck there,” he said. “We’re not giving each other any outs. We’re just hanging each other out to dry.”Ryan Callahan, the team captain, called the Rangers’ effort spotty. Tortorella agreed. “We can’t bring anybody up from Hartford,” the coach said. “We have just got to decide, consistently as a group, how we’re going to play. So I guess you have to appeal to that.”The Rangers did call up Kris Newbury from Connecticut, their American Hockey League club, and he got into one of the game’s two fights. Newbury received an extra minor penalty in his fight, which gave the Flyers a power play that led to Voracek’s goal. That turned out to be the game-winner.Chris Kreider, who scored five goals in the playoffs last season after joining the Rangers straight out of Boston College, did not dress for the game. Tortorella said before the game that Kreider was a “good kid” who would be watching from the press box for at least a while.The Flyers were without Scott Hartnell, who is out four to eight weeks with a fractured bone in his foot, and another key forward, Danny Briere, who is expected back soon from a wrist injury. They were also without forward Brayden Schenn, who was suspended one game for an illegal hit.“These games are hard to lose,” Rangers defenseman Dan Girardi said. “We knew they were going to be desperate, looking for their first win, and we had to match that. We didn’t.”To be fair, Bryzgalov made two great stops on the five-on-three — one on Derek Stepan and one on Nash.But Tortorella called the failure to finish “the frustrating part — we may have been able to steal a point anyway, if we get something happening there.”With the season shortened because of the lockout, the Rangers are trying not to feel pressure from their slow start.“We’re not paying attention to the schedule — we’re just in the season now,” Lundqvist said. “I thought after that Boston game at home, we had some good energy. We had a chance to tie it up tonight, but they defended real well.”SLAP SHOTSArron Asham missed a second straight game with a groin pull he sustained in Sunday’s 6-3 loss against Pittsburgh. He said he expected to be back for the Rangers’ next game, Saturday against Toronto at Madison Square Garden."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/sports/football/love-affair-with-baltimore-colts-remains-with-ravens.html,"BALTIMORE — If Harry Swayne could choose, he would appoint Lenny Moore as the Baltimore Ravens’ honorary captain for the pregame coin toss at Super Bowl XLVII.At the very least, Moore will be one of several former Baltimore Colts players who still live here to accompany the approximately 1,000 employees of the Ravens and their families to New Orleans for the Super Bowl, Swayne said.“We love our former Colts,” said Swayne, the Ravens’ director of player development, who played 15 years in the N.F.L. as an offensive lineman and reached Super Bowls with three teams, including the Ravens in 2001.Since the Ravens came into existence in 1996, when the owner Art Modell moved the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore, the franchise has embraced the city’s football past. For fans still smarting from the Colts’ middle-of-the-night departure from Baltimore to Indianapolis in 1984, the presence of stars they had cheered for decades helped connect them to a new team with a different nickname and logo.Moore, a Hall of Fame running back, is often at the Ravens’ training complex in Owings Mills, Md. The former Colts running back Tom Matte used to be an analyst on Ravens radio broadcasts, and the former Colts linebacker Stan White currently is. The former Colts safety Bruce Laird is the N.F.L.’s uniform inspector at Ravens home games.Team-sponsored alumni events involve former Colts and Ravens alike. The Marching Ravens band evolved from the famed Baltimore Colts Marching Band, and the Ring of Honor in the Ravens’ stadium includes eight Colts. Each year, the Ravens take their rookies to the Sports Legends Museum at Camden Yards so they can learn about the city’s athletic history.Ravens fans entering M&T Bank Stadium even rub the feet of a Johnny Unitas statue for good luck.Most of those fans are too young to have seen Unitas and Moore play, but the two remain beloved for leading the Colts to N.F.L. championships in 1958 and 1959 against the Giants.Unitas, a Hall of Famer, was the quarterback here for 17 seasons, including for the team that won Super Bowl V. Even with his death in 2002, his legacy endures, perhaps more than any other Baltimore Colt’s. Fans still wear No. 19 throwback jerseys, and the football stadium at Towson University bears his name.His legacy also endures in a Ravens employee handling executive sales: Chad Unitas, whose flat-top hair style evokes that of his father.“It makes me feel good that people haven’t forgotten about him,” the younger Unitas said. “They still want to hear stories about him.”This football-mad city with enough pigskin-abandonment issues to keep numerous therapists busy is now fully behind the Ravens heading into the Super Bowl against the San Francisco 49ers, to be played Feb. 3. Purple lights illuminate building facades downtown, team flags flap on storefronts and from car windows, and Joe Flacco and Ray Rice jerseys are ever more ubiquitous.The shadow the departed Colts cast over Baltimore began lifting when Modell relocated the Browns here after the 1995 season. Modell, Chad Unitas said, “called my dad as he was moving the team to Baltimore” to gain his support. The current owner, Steve Bisciotti, who grew up a Colts fan, embraced their legacy, too, Unitas said.While Baltimore’s enduring love affair with its lost franchise and its players endures, it is nuanced and generational.Those coming of age after the Colts left have no football past with which to grapple, while some older fans never adopted the Ravens. For them, “it’s the Colts, the Colts and only the Colts,” said Neil Alperstein, 65, a communication professor at Loyola University who grew up here and studies what he calls the “imaginary relationships” admirers form with celebrities.Still, Alperstein and some of his contemporaries became passionate Ravens fans for whom the team’s defeat of visiting Indianapolis in an opening-round playoff game this month carried no additional emotional charge.But like with some people in happy second marriages, some scars linger. Matte, for one, said he remained upset that his wristband displayed at the Hall of Fame identified him as an Indianapolis Colt, although his entire 12-year career was spent here.Ted Marchibroda, who coached the Colts in the 1970s and returned as the Ravens’ first coach, has a singular perspective, having had his feet planted in all three domains. Marchibroda said that he considered Baltimore “a great football city,” but that he would cheer for the 49ers next weekend because their coach, Jim Harbaugh, as a Colts quarterback, “almost took us to the Super Bowl, when I was coaching Indianapolis.”Matte has connections to even more Baltimore-area teams than Marchibroda. He announced games for the U.S.F.L.’s Baltimore Stars in 1985, although they played near Washington, and he co-owned the C.F.L.’s Baltimore Stallions, who played at Memorial Stadium in 1994 and 1995, 2 of the 12 seasons in which the city had no N.F.L. team.Matte’s first year with the Colts, 1961, was the last for Art Donovan, a defensive lineman who had a Hall of Fame career in Baltimore.Donovan is perhaps second only to Unitas when it comes to recognizable stars from the Baltimore Colts’ glory days, and his first connection to the Ravens is from his youth in the Bronx. He played football for Mount St. Michael Academy, where he faced Eddie Breslin of Fordham Prep. Breslin’s sister, Patricia, was someone “I had a bit of a crush on,” Donovan said.She would go on to marry Modell, the first Ravens owner.Donovan actually played for two Baltimore Colts franchises. The one he played for in 1950 folded, but he came back with the second incarnation, which moved here from Dallas and, before that, New York.Now 87, Donovan is remembered by many as a raconteur.These days, Donovan’s children and grandchildren frequently join him to watch telecasts of Ravens games in the home he built on the grounds of a country club he and his wife, Dorothy, own. The home’s front door evokes the Colts, with blue-on-white tiles reading “DONOVAN 70,” his uniform number.He recently returned from the hospital, where he had a bladder operation. Dorothy is now in the hospital herself, and when Donovan visited her this week, “these two doctors went like this,” Donovan said, suddenly extending his arms in a blocking motion.“I love it!” he said. “I love that they remember me. You never forget your roots.”Then, speaking of the Ravens, he said: “And it will go on to these guys playing today. It will go on with the generations after we’re dead and buried.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/sports/tennis/murray-outduels-federer-and-heads-to-australian-open-final.html,"MELBOURNE — It was quite a night of tennis and ultimately a rough night for Roger Federer, who not only swore in the direction of Andy Murray but was also beaten in a Grand Slam tournament for the first time by Murray.The British player’s poised performance in the Australian Open semifinal on Friday was in part Federer’s fault, of course.If Federer had not set the bar quite so stratospherically high in the 2000s, Murray in his youth might have been tempted to coast on his gifts; might have been content to keep chomping candy bars and guzzling soda and putting in the practice hours but not — to toy with a British expression — the hardest yards.If Federer had not driven Murray to tears in a series of Grand Slam finals and left him reeling with doubt and unfulfilled potential, he might never have felt the need to transform himself into quite such a physical specimen; might never have maximized his speed and his serve or hired Ivan Lendl to help him kick his nasty, energy-sapping habit of grousing at himself, his entourage and the vagaries of a game that is ill suited to the demands of a perfectionist.But an incomplete commitment — to one’s plans, to one’s talent — simply wouldn’t cut it in the era that has belonged to Federer more than any man but has gradually, inexorably become more communal property.The result was there for the 31-year-old Swiss icon and everyone else to see on a cool Friday night in Rod Laver Arena as Murray advanced to the Australian Open final with a five-set victory in this city where it was hard to believe that it had been blowing Sahara hot just the day before.Federer — in an unusually feisty, palpably hungry mood — often played like the Federer in our mind’s eye, leaping high to flick backhand smashes, wrong-footing Murray with his forehand and slapping exquisitely timed half volleys on the baseline that still — after all these years — managed to surprise Murray (the repeated Federer drop shots were a different matter).Those who would read decline into this defeat had best watch the highlight reel again closely.But his brilliance and energy came in waves while Murray was a more constant force.Federer, not Murray, seemed to be the one always pushing, even straining, to keep pace, and perhaps it was that point-in, point-out burden that explains why this match — rare in an age of collegiality at the top — developed a genuine edge: Oaths and dark looks included.After dropping the first set, Federer came back to win the second.After losing the third, he found himself two points from defeat on Murray’s serve and then with a few brilliant swipes of his racket, put himself in position to win the fourth.But the fifth set — beautifully poised to become an exclamation point — devolved into something more understated as Murray broke early, took a quick 3-0 lead and maintained his edge (and most of his cool) to win, 6-4, 6-7 (5-7), 6-3, 6-7 (2-7), 6-2, in precisely four hours.The anticlimactic finish should not detract from Murray’s achievement. Though he now leads their career series 11-9, he was 0-3 until Friday in Grand Slam tournament play: losing the 2008 United States Open final, the 2010 Australian Open final and the Wimbledon final last year.“I’ve obviously lost some tough matches against him in the slams, so to win one, especially the way that it went tonight, was obviously nice,” Murray said.Murray did beat Federer in the Olympic final last year, also played at Wimbledon, but the victory on Friday came in a pro-Federer atmosphere that left one wondering whether they should not have handed out cowbells and Swiss chocolates at the gate.“I didn’t realize they played the Australian Open in Zurich,” a British spectator remarked.Murray’s reward for this road victory was a place in the final on Sunday against Novak Djokovic, the No. 1 seed who had the evening off while the second-seeded Federer and third-seeded Murray played deep into the night.“I’m going to be ready for pain,” Murray said.So he should be considering his and Djokovic’s supreme defensive skills and their consistency off the ground.This will be a rematch of the grueling Australian Open semifinal match last year that Djokovic won in five sets on his way to defending his title.This will also be a rematch of the United States Open final last year, where Murray won in five more sets to take his first Grand Slam singles title and where some rallies were long enough to generate nervous laughter in Arthur Ashe Stadium.Conventional wisdom says that Murray should swing more freely as a major champion, but Djokovic has now won 20 straight matches in Melbourne and has been, on balance, the world’s best player on hard courts over the last two seasons.“Obviously Novak goes in as the favorite, I would think, even though Andy beat him at the U.S. Open,” Federer said.Murray said he had “no idea” whether his victory in New York would help him.“I would hope so,” he said. “The task isn’t any easier. I’m obviously playing Novak again on this court. I mean, this has been his best court for sure. So I’m aware of how tough it will be to win the match.”They have been aware of each other’s talents since they began facing each other in their early teens in European junior competitions. Born one week apart in May 1987, they are now both 25 years old and appear set to face each other across many more nets in the seasons to come.Murray did not drop a set until facing Federer, but he will have one less day of rest than Djokovic because of the Australian Open’s longstanding policy of splitting the men’s semifinals into separate sessions in order to increase revenue. But the extra day has not proved particularly advantageous to recent finalists, and Murray looks remarkably fit this year.Against Federer he was the more convincing and intimidating server: hitting 21 aces to Federer’s five and also winning 63 percent of the points off his second serves to Federer’s 42 percent.That last figure was, of course, a tribute to Murray’s returning, and in another twist, Murray also had 21 forehand winners off his traditionally weaker wing compared with Federer’s 18.“I think he made things more difficult for me because in the past, even though he served well, I had the impression I returned better against him,” Federer said. “I regret that a bit, but I think he found the zones very well tonight, and perhaps he won the match for that reason.”There were many emotional peaks on Friday, but the summit came late in the fourth set with Murray serving for the match at 6-5.Murray won the first point of the game after an extended rally with a forehand passing shot. As the ball flew past, Federer glared in Murray’s direction and appeared to swear. If so, it was hardly Federer’s first oath of the evening and it was unclear why he was barking toward Murray.Murray took notice, then twisted away, pursed his lips and nodded his head repeatedly.“We just looked at each other one time,” Federer said. “That’s O.K., I think, in a three-and-a-half-hour match. We were just checking each other out for a bit. No, I mean, that wasn’t a big deal for me. I hope not for him.”Murray also minimized the incident. “I wasn’t that surprised,” he said. “I mean stuff like that happens daily in tennis matches. You know, in sport, the stuff that some people say on football pitches and in basketball and all sorts of sports. I mean, it was very, very mild in comparison to what happens in other sports.”Asked to repeat what Federer said, Murray declined. “It’s not relevant what was said,” he answered. “People will want to make a big deal of it, and it isn’t really a big deal.”Perhaps not on a night when there were so many fast-twitch exchanges, so many clutch serves and so many creative solutions to tennis trouble. But Federer’s angry shout was certainly an indication of how much winning this semifinal mattered to him despite all his victories past.Depriving him of the pleasure required the full force of Murray’s mature talent, and it was quite a sight."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/sports/golf/golf-roundup.html,"SAN DIEGO (AP) — Tiger Woods made it look easy on a dreary day at Torrey Pines and wound up in a place he has not been in five years.He had the 36-hole lead by himself here for the first time since 2008.Woods did not miss a shot during a four-hole stretch around the turn on the North Course, including a 5-iron to 5 feet for eagle and a wedge that one-hopped off the pin to set up birdie. It carried him to a seven-under-par 65 on Friday and gave him a two-shot lead in the Farmers Insurance Open.“I feel good right now,” Woods said. “I’m leading the tournament.”Woods was at 11-under 133 and had a two-shot lead over Billy Horschel, with six other players three shots behind Woods. Already a favorite with seven wins as a pro at Torrey Pines, Woods had even more in his favor going into the weekend: a 74-0 edge in PGA Tour wins against the next seven players behind him.Horschel, who had to go back to qualifying school to get his card last year, had a 69 on the South Course to get into the final group.Woods caught a break in the draw by playing the North — it is about 600 yards shorter — on a day of light rain, a late breeze and soft conditions. But he kept the ball in play off the tee, and he got in trouble only once. That was on the par-4 eighth hole, when he drove into a tough lie in the bunker, and it led to his only bogey.Phil Mickelson struggled a bit more, fighting to keep his hands dry in the wet weather and finishing bogey-bogey on the South for a 71 to make the cut on the number.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/sports/football/ravens-bernard-pollard-delivers-loud-words-and-big-hits.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — In the Baltimore Ravens’ locker room, Bernard Pollard blends into the background.Terrell Suggs, the veteran linebacker, has a daily habit of cranking up the volume on his stereo system to a decibel level that could be described as “ear bleeding,” though it barely manages to drown out his own voice. Wide receiver Jacoby Jones sings. Linebacker Ray Lewis shrieks.It is a noisy place, packed with personalities. And then there is Pollard, a strong safety who generally keeps to himself until game day, when he channels a boatload of inner rage into hits that render unusually large human beings into lesser versions of themselves.“Guys are afraid to run across the middle against him,” defensive end Arthur Jones said.Last Sunday, in the Ravens’ 28-13 victory over the New England Patriots for the A.F.C. championship, Pollard reinforced his reputation as a man who hurts people — Patriots in particular. In the fourth quarter, running back Stevan Ridley lowered his helmet and struck Pollard head-on, Ridley’s body going limp as he fumbled. The Ravens recovered the ball and later scored to cement a berth in the Super Bowl against the San Francisco 49ers.Ridley was merely the latest member of the Patriots organization to sustain an injury after being hit by Pollard, joining the likes of Tom Brady (knee, 2008), Wes Welker (knee, 2010) and Rob Gronkowski (ankle, 2012). Pollard, a seventh-year veteran, said there was never any malicious intent.“This is a violent sport,” he said, adding: “I ask you the question: If I came to your house with the doors locked, and I just kicked it down and tried to steal stuff, you’re going to defend your house, right? So that’s the stand I take. We got grass behind us, and we have an end zone that we have to defend.”Pollard does not try to intimidate people, he said. It just seems to happen. This week, when he discovered that a television reporter had borrowed the chair from his locker so he could interview another player, Pollard glared at him. “I’m going to use my fist on you!” he said. Then he smiled. “I’m joking, man. Don’t sue me.” (The reporter, for the record, looked terrified.)Ryan Moats, a former running back who was a teammate of Pollard’s on the Houston Texans, said Pollard’s primary mode of self-expression was yelling — not because he is angry, but because this apparently is the only way he knows how to communicate. Moats said he once tried to explain to Pollard that normal people talk, especially on the phone. It did not do much good.“Very confident individual,” said Moats, who compared the 6-foot-1, 225-pound Pollard to the former Philadelphia Eagles safety Brian Dawkins, who carried himself with the same relentless tenacity. “There are very few people in the game who are like that, where it just pours out of them.”Moats, who runs his own graphics-design company, recently teamed with Pollard to design an iPhone app based on the card game bourré. As one can imagine, Pollard was extremely hands on. He knows what he wants and how he wants it, said Moats, who could not recall Pollard conceding failure, not once, not at anything.“And that’s the way he plays the game,” Moats said. “He’s one of the most sure tacklers I’ve ever gone up against. He’s going to get a piece of you every time, all the time. He’s going to do everything he can to get you on the ground. It’s his passion.”Befitting his growing stature in the league, Pollard has multiple nicknames. He has been known to refer to himself as Chocolate Therapy (for his dance moves) and as the Bonecrusher (for obvious reasons). Jones, in the most glowing way possible, calls Pollard a “Christian thug.”“He loves the Lord, but he means business,” Jones said.Pollard’s confidence reveals itself in the locker room, where he has no qualms about being naked. He will conduct full interviews in the nude. Pants are the enemy. When local journalists gave Pollard their “good guy” award after the 2011 season for being accommodating, they presented him with a pair of boxer shorts, in the hope that he would wear them. His own teammates have encouraged him to use a towel or two.When Pollard was younger, authority figures sometimes struggled to keep him in line. Joe Tiller, his former coach at Purdue, said Pollard was “not the easiest guy to manage.” When Pollard was a junior, he and Tiller got into a highly publicized shouting match during a preseason practice. As Pollard left the field, Tiller extended the length of Pollard’s suspension each time he opened his mouth: one day, two days, three days.“He’s a high-intensity guy,” Tiller said in a telephone interview, “and I doubt that’s changed.”Pollard remains a man of extremes, and unapologetically so. He is not in the business of making friends.“I really don’t care if you like me,” he said. “I really don’t care if you don’t like the things I say. It’s not going to stop me from being who I am.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/hockey/nhl-hockey-roundup.html,"Patrick Marleau became the second player in N.H.L. history to open a season with four straight multigoal games, striking twice on the power play in the first period of the host San Jose Sharks’ 4-0 victory against the Colorado Avalanche on Saturday.He has scored two goals in each game this season, joining Ottawa’s Cy Denneny in 1917-18 as the only players to open a season with four multigoal games, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.Both of Marleau’s goals came after Ryan O’Byrne took additional minor penalties for retaliating after San Jose’s Brad Stuart flattened Colorado’s captain, Gabriel Landeskog, with a vicious hit.“You have a situation where a teammate is defending another teammate, which is the game of hockey, and in those situations we need to step up and get the job done for our teammate,” Colorado Coach Joe Sacco said. “We just didn’t get it done. That was the difference in the game.”Joe Thornton added a power-play goal in the second period, giving San Jose 10 power-play goals in four games. The Sharks are off to their best start since winning their first four games in 2008-9.The Avalanche lost their seventh straight game in San Jose since winning Game 1 of a first-round playoff series in 2010. After killing 16 straight penalties entering Saturday, Colorado allowed goals on San Jose’s first three power plays and another only 11 seconds after killing the Sharks’ fourth man advantage.San Jose’s power play is in midseason form, with 10 goals in 24 chances. Marleau has four of those goals. He is the first Sharks player with four straight multigoal games and the first N.H.L. player with that many since Alexander Mogilny had five straight for Buffalo in 1992-93.“He’s been skating extremely well,” San Jose Coach Todd McLellan said of Marleau. “A ton of confidence. He’s prepared to shoot the puck. He’s engaged physically.”BLACKHAWKS 3, BLUE JACKETS 2 Jonathan Toews scored the winning goal early in the third period, and Corey Crawford made 24 saves as visiting Chicago matched its best start ever at 5-0. The Blackhawks also won their first five games in 1971-72.“That was one of those games where maybe we didn’t play our best hockey like we’ve seen in the last five games,” Toews said, “but as a team, it doesn’t matter who goes out there you’ve got to find a way to win.”Crawford, who won for the fourth time this season, was particularly strong when the Blackhawks were a man down. They killed all five penalties.“The puck looks pretty big right now,” Crawford said.KINGS 4, COYOTES 2 Anze Kopitar scored two goals to spark visiting Los Angeles’s top line and the defending Stanley Cup champion Kings earned their first victory of the season.Scoreless through the season’s first three games, the Kings’ top line of Kopitar, Dustin Brown and Justin Williams combined for 4 points against host Phoenix as Los Angeles avoided its first four-game winless start since 1997-98.BLUES 4, STARS 3 David Perron scored two goals and had an assist, and Wade Redden notched his first N.H.L. goal in almost three years to lead St. Louis at Dallas.Redden, skating in just his second N.H.L. game after two years in the minors, gave the Blues a 1-0 lead 5 minutes 31 seconds into the opening period. It was Redden’s first goal since March 18, 2010, when he scored for the Rangers against the Blues.FLYERS 7, PANTHERS 1 Matt Read had his first career three-goal game, and visiting Philadelphia won its second straight after losing its first three games.

Didier Ya Konan added the third seconds after coming on as a substitute.The captain Didier Drogba was dropped from the starting lineup for the first time, although he came on for the final 25 minutes, and Kolo Touré was also left out by Coach Sabri Lamouchi as he attempted to kick-start the campaign for the Ivorians, who are favored to the tournament.The victory means Ivory Coast, the only undefeated team in the tournament, could be the first team to advance if Algeria and Togo play to a tie in a later game Saturday. (REUTERS)MOURINHO UNDER FIRE Real Madrid Coach Jose Mourinho again chose not to speak to the news media as he celebrated his 50th birthday on Saturday.Coverage of the Spanish champions was dominated last week by a report in the Marca sports daily that said the team captains Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos had threatened to leave along with several teammates unless Mourinho was dismissed.The club president, Florentino Pérez, said the newspaper was lying and trying to destabilize the club but Marca has stuck by its account, the latest in a string of reports suggesting that not all is well among Mourinho and some of his leading players.The combative Portuguese has drawn criticism this season with his team 15 points behind La Liga leaders Barcelona. Madrid hosts its archrival Wednesday in the first leg of their King’s Cup semifinals.Elimination in the Cup and then a possible defeat against Manchester United in their Champions League Round of 16 series would almost certainly end Madrid’s hopes of winning a trophy this season and increase the pressure on Pérez to replace Mourinho.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/football/joe-greenes-keepsakes-no-longer-his.html,"PHOENIX — Joe Greene was one of the most feared defenders of his generation, a Hall of Fame lineman on the vaunted Steel Curtain defense that was the cornerstone of four of the Steelers’ Super Bowl titles. He became a pop culture icon after he appeared in a Coca-Cola commercial that was broadcast during the Super Bowl in 1980.Britton Child was among the many fans who admired Greene, who was nicknamed Mean Joe. Growing up in Salt Lake City in the 1970s, Child adopted the Steelers as his team because a neighbor rooted for them. For a class project in elementary school, Child wrote to his hero. He received no response.“I was a huge Steelers fan and thought the world of him,” Child, now 39, said in a phone interview. He said it broke his heart that Greene did not write back. “I’ve occasionally thought about that letter, whether it got lost in the mail or did he get it and not respond,” he said.The letter, it turns out, has been sitting for years in a warehouse in Phoenix among boxes of Greene’s belongings. It was thrown in with photographs, plaques and awards, Steelers playbooks, highlight reels and a film of his Coca-Cola commercial. There are also VHS tapes (“Roots,” “Fame”), magazines (Ebony, Financial World), scripts from the movie “Smokey and the Bandit II” and an episode of the television show “Barbara Mandrell and the Mandrell Sisters,” on which Greene appeared with Conway Twitty, Fran Tarkenton and Vince Ferragamo.Child’s letter is one of hundreds that Greene kept. They came from every corner of the country and from as far away as Ghana. Based on the handwriting, many appear to have been written by children, some of whom misspelled the address. The most succinct read: “Mr. Joe Green, c/o Pittsburg Steelers, Pittsburg, P.A.”It is unclear why Greene kept the letters, which were surely a fraction of the fan mail he received during his 13-year career. Greene coached for the Steelers, the Miami Dolphins and the Arizona Cardinals after he retired in 1981, so the letters may have traveled to several cities. People on the move often do not unpack things. Greene did not respond to requests to speak, but a representative, Ward Headley, said Greene probably left the letters and other belongings in Arizona because he did not need them.Whatever the reason, the cache represents a largely undisturbed if eclectic window into the life of one of the biggest football stars of the 1970s. It is also a reminder of how possessions can change hands in fickle ways and how easily memories can be lost and rediscovered.The letters, along with dozens of deflated footballs, scouting reports and ledgers from a restaurant Greene had in the 1980s, might have been lost if Michael Levine had not taken possession of more than 200 furniture vaults. In 2004, a moving company rented 10,000 square feet in one of his warehouses in downtown Phoenix to store the giant wooden boxes. After more than a year, the movers stopped paying rent, and Levine was left with the vaults.Levine, a metal sculptor who often scrounges for odds and ends to use, could not find anyone to buy the vaults. So instead of sending them to the landfill, “I had a morbid curiosity and started to open them,” he said. “Since I had these warehouses, I had experience finding old stuff behind walls and in other odd places. It’s kind of a weird rush to find stuff.”Most of it was “bottom-of-the-rung stuff,” Levine said, and he and his team made many trips to Goodwill to donate much of it. But they also found a leather-bound book and photographs that belonged to Larry Wilson, a Hall of Fame safety who had been an executive with the Cardinals. Through the team, Levine found Wilson, who visited the warehouse to get his things. The book was a long-lost gift and Wilson began to cry when he saw it, Levine said.But Greene’s things were packed willy-nilly, and sorting through them was a bigger chore. There were some tacky sombreros; hundreds of canceled checks bearing Greene’s given name, Charles Edward Greene; and a grill with charcoal and petrified hot dog buns still in it. There was even some memorabilia from the Arizona Wranglers, a team from the short-lived United States Football League.But Levine, 44 and a football fan with a collector’s instinct, found plenty more. There was, for instance, a box that read, “To Mean Joe Greene. From Coca-Cola,” and films of his famous commercial. There were 10 pairs of shoes with Greene’s No. 75 on the back and torn practice jerseys. There were playbooks and scouting reports, including one on the Raiders from 1977. Defensive goals in one report included inducing three turnovers, getting to the quarterback four times and eliminating all big plays. “Pursuit and gang tackling are a vital part of team effort,” the report read.In one book, Chuck Noll, the Steelers’ coach, welcomed players to the 1980 training camp at St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa., and wrote that they would be fined $10 for every pound they were overweight, $25 for being late to practice and $500 if they left training camp. Players were to “use good judgment” when smoking, and card games “should be kept at minimum size pots.” No Levis were to be worn on the road. One final warning, on morals: “Stay away from girls on campus.”There were also yellow plastic boxes from N.F.L. Films with highlight reels from 1970, a playoff game against the Raiders in 1974 and Super Bowl IX, when the Steelers beat the Minnesota Vikings at Tulane Stadium in New Orleans. Yet another box contained dozens of deflated footballs, including one signed by Greene’s teammates in 1981, his last season, and another signed by the Steelers’ owner, Art Rooney, that read, “Lots of Luck.”There was also plenty of evidence of Greene’s popularity. There were commemorative Iron City beer cans and a board game called Real Action Quarterback Football. Its box read, “Mean Joe Greene says, ‘Get the Quarterback.’ ” There was a black satin jacket from the TV show “Solid Gold.” One T-shirt read, “Sacking Machine. Mean Joe Greene.”Several photographs showed Greene being inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1987. There was also a framed certificate from the Hall. Another certificate from 1992 was signed by the mayor of Dade County, Fla., who declared Mean Joe Greene Day. One of Greene’s achievements, the mayor noted, was winning a Clio award for his Coke commercial. Greene kept a program from a testimonial dinner for Franco Harris in 1984. On the back, someone wrote, “#1 draft choice” and “Man of action.”Then there were the letters. Kurt Stayrook from Cincinnati wrote to Greene at the same time his brother wrote to Terry Bradshaw, the Steelers’ quarterback, who sent back a postcard. Doug Root, who still lives in Delmar, N.Y., drew a picture of Greene on his letter and wrote, “Hey Kid, here’s your Coke. burp.”“He was one of my favorites,” said Root, an artist who still follows the Steelers. “I’m surprised he kept my letter. Players have a lot of stuff and move around a lot.”Other fans were less complimentary. Patrick Brosnan wrote “Go Raiders” on the envelope he sent to Greene. “As a devoted Oakland Raider fan, I am very happy you have decided to retire,” he wrote inside. “Stop the bruises and broken bones of my Raiders!!”Now a retired police officer living near Chico, Calif., Brosnan, 68, said he and his friends sat in the Black Hole cheering section at Raiders home games and would ride Greene and the other Steelers when they came onto the field in Oakland.“I hated him, but I could sit down and have a beer with him,” Brosnan said. “That’s the only letter I’ve ever written to a player. I was complimenting him and seeing if he wanted to correspond with me, but of course he didn’t.”Levine found Greene, who left the Cardinals after the 2003 season, through Dan Rooney of the Steelers. Levine said Greene wanted him to send everything to his home in Texas but did not offer to pay for the shipping. Greene, according to Headley, his representative, thought Levine was trying to sell his things to him.Whatever the story, it is unclear what the collection is worth. It goes far beyond the usual uniforms and helmets, which are the easiest items to price. Instead, there is a slice of one player’s life.“The more popular the player, the greater the market,” said Barry Meisel, the president of the MeiGray Group, a sports memorabilia company. “But the more esoteric the items, the more the player would have to transcend the game.”Greene, of course, did transcend the game in ways few players of his generation did."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/baseball/alex-rodriguez-raises-more-concerns-for-yankees.html,"Nearly four years after Alex Rodriguez admitted that he used steroids for a portion of his professional career, he continues to be a source of curiosity and concern for Major League Baseball and the Yankees.Rodriguez turns 38 in July, appears increasingly brittle and no longer seems assured of surpassing Barry Bonds as baseball’s career home run leader. He is also just halfway through a 10-year, $275 million contract that has become a burden for the Yankees. Major League Baseball officials remain uneasy about his past links, however indirect, to performance-enhancing drugs, unsure if they know all the facts. And the Yankees appear to share some of those sentiments.That uneasiness came into play in December, when the Yankees learned that Rodriguez needed to have surgery on his left hip less than four years after he had a similar procedure on the right one. At that point, the Yankees made clear to Rodriguez that they did not want him to go back to the doctor he used the first time, according to several people in baseball briefed on the matter.That doctor, Marc Philippon, has had links to Anthony Galea, the Canada-based physician who secretly treated Rodriguez as he recovered from his 2009 operation. Galea pleaded guilty two years later to federal charges stemming from his distribution of human growth hormone to professional athletes.Although Rodriguez insisted in an interview with investigators for Major League Baseball that he never received banned substances from Galea, those investigators have not been satisfied that they know the whole story. On more than one occasion, they have been rebuffed when they asked federal authorities to share evidence related to Galea’s treatment of Rodriguez.But while that issue appears to be at a standstill, baseball’s investigators are now examining what links Rodriguez and several other players may have with a Miami-area man named Anthony Bosch, who has previously come to the attention of baseball and federal authorities.According to several people in baseball, the investigators are again looking at Bosch and his father, Pedro, a physician, who came under the scrutiny of baseball and the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2009. At the time, baseball’s investigators suspected that Manny Ramirez, who had been suspended for 50 games for violating baseball’s drug-testing program, had received a banned substance from Pedro Bosch.The new interest in the Bosches was first reported Saturday by The Daily News, which said that Anthony Bosch had advised Rodriguez on his nutrition and physical training and had helped him get input on blood test results.It is unclear just how seriously federal authorities are scrutinizing either of the Bosches or whether any action can eventually be taken by Major League Baseball, which has struggled for several years to punish players who have been linked to performance-enhancing drugs but have not tested positive for a banned substance.The latest revelations come as Rodriguez continues to recuperate from the operation he had in New York on Jan. 16 to repair a torn labrum and impingement in his left hip. Dr. Bryan Kelly, an orthopedist at the Hospital for Special Surgery, performed the procedure.How long it will take Rodriguez to return to the Yankees’ lineup is unclear, although the best estimate is that it will be sometime after the All-Star break in July.In March 2009, Rodriguez had hip surgery to repair a torn labrum in Philippon’s offices in Vail, Colo., and he returned to action two months later. In that instance, Philippon recommended that the Yankees use a Toronto-based specialist named Mark Lindsay, who had worked with Galea, to oversee Rodriguez’s rehabilitation. But Rodriguez was quietly seen by Galea, too.Initially, Rodriguez maintained to the Yankees that he had not been treated by Galea. However, that assertion was later contradicted by Galea, who said in 2010 that he had treated Rodriguez but said he never gave him performance-enhancing drugs.“He had a damaged hip,” Galea said at the time. “He needed anti-inflammatories.”Philippon claimed that he did not know that Galea had treated Rodriguez and questioned Galea’s assertions that Rodriguez had an inflamed hip. “If that’s the case, I would be surprised because Alex never told me that his hip hurt,” Philippon had said.Shortly thereafter, Rodriguez was interviewed by baseball’s investigators about his relationship with Galea and made his denials that Galea had treated him with performance-enhancing drugs.This time, Philippon and Galea are not involved in Rodriguez’s care. But an overall uncertainty about Rodriguez remains, for baseball and the Yankees. What they know is this: that Rodriguez admitted in March 2009 that he had used performance-enhancing substances from 2001 to 2003, while he was a member of the Texas Rangers; that he has not played in more than 140 games since 2007; that he has hit fewer than 20 home runs and driven in fewer than 70 runs in each of the last two seasons; and that with 647 home runs, he still needs 116 more to surpass Bonds. And that questions about Rodriguez never seem to go away."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/football/ravens-seek-hall-victory-for-art-modell.html,"Selectors to the Pro Football Hall of Fame must decide Saturday whether Art Modell’s moving his team from Cleveland to Baltimore in 1996 should undermine his more than four decades of handiwork that helped the N.F.L. to prominence.Modell, who died Sept. 6 at 87, is among 15 finalists being considered by a 46-person selection committee the day before the Ravens — the name his team adopted after the Browns’ nickname and colors were left with Cleveland — meet the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl XLVII. Bill Parcells, who coached the Giants and the Jets, among others, and the former 49ers owner Ed DeBartolo Jr. are the other nonplayers being considered.Tackle Jonathan Ogden, Modell’s initial first-round draft choice for the Ravens, is among four first-time nominees, joining guard Larry Allen, defensive tackle Warren Sapp and defensive end Michael Strahan. Other players under consideration are running back Jerome Bettis; wide receivers Tim Brown, Cris Carter and Andre Reed; guard Will Shields; defensive end Charles Haley; linebacker Kevin Greene; and cornerback Aeneas Williams. Four to seven finalists will be inducted.No finalist is likely to stir as much emotion as Modell when his worthiness for a bust in Canton, Ohio, is debated. The Giants owner John Mara said it was “unfortunate and unfair” that Modell was not enshrined while alive. Modell was previously a finalist in 2001.“I can think of very few others who had the dramatic effect on the growth of the league that Art Modell had for many years,” Mara said.Modell, who was born in Brooklyn and dropped out of high school at 15 to support his family after the death of his father, is best known for his work as the league’s broadcast chairman, among numerous accomplishments. He negotiated television agreements from 1962 to ’93 that played a huge role in increasing the popularity of the sport and was heavily involved in the creation of “Monday Night Football.”That apparently means little to Greg Brinda, who hosts a sports talk show on WKNR in Cleveland. He grew up as a Browns fan and will never forget the day Modell left town. “I don’t think you could commit a greater sin against a fan base,” he said.Time does not appear to be healing the wound created when Modell announced his decision shortly before a referendum passed overwhelmingly to provide public money to renovate aging Municipal Stadium. When Modell died, the Browns were the only team not to offer a game-day tribute to him. Mike Holmgren, then the team president, canceled plans at the request of the mourning family, which feared a backlash. The Ravens have worn patches on their uniforms that read “Art.”Tony Grossi, who has reported on the Browns since 1984, is asking fans what position he should take as Cleveland’s representative on the selection committee.“The response has been overwhelming in volume and pretty lopsided,” he said. “They still feel the same way. They want me to speak against his Hall of Fame nomination.”Grossi was vigorously opposed before this.“I covered Art in good times and bad times,” Grossi said. “I felt the one act of moving the team when he did, and the way he did it, obscures all of the good he did. It was a severe blow to Cleveland, its fan base, its tradition, the league itself. It was a gigantic black eye, and I don’t know what changed to characterize that any differently.”Although numerous reports indicated that Modell headed to Baltimore to put heavy financial losses behind him, his son, David, does not wish to delve into the circumstances that led Sports Illustrated to run a Dec. 4, 1995, cover that depicted a caricature of Modell punching a Browns mascot in the gut.“The move story has been told and retold so many times, and it’s been pretty clear that he agonized over the decision,” David Modell said.While the Ravens won the Super Bowl during the 2000 season, the pain did not ease for Cleveland fans, who were without a team for three seasons. The new Browns have at times not appeared to be N.F.L. caliber. Plagued by instability, the Browns have had two winning seasons and one playoff berth since they returned to the field in 1999. The Indians have not won the World Series since 1948. The Cavaliers will always be associated with their inability to retain the Ohio native LeBron James.The history Modell’s supporters emphasize demonstrates the profound effect he had in elevating the N.F.L. He led the Owners Labor Committee in 1968 when it negotiated the first collective bargaining agreement with the players. He broke an impasse that made the N.F.L. merger with the American Football League possible by agreeing to shift the Browns to the A.F.C. He helped establish N.F.L. Films and was its first chairman. He hired the first black general manager, Ozzie Newsome, whose eye for talent has helped the Ravens advance to the playoffs a league-high five straight seasons, culminating in this Super Bowl appearance.“We are hopeful for a big Raven weekend with Art in a virtual yellow jacket and the team with a new trophy,” David Modell said.For unforgiving Browns fans, it would be their second-worst nightmare."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/golf/an-australian-cuts-a-trail-on-pga-tour.html,"SAN DIEGO — Torrey Pines’s beauty can be entrancing, especially to a first-time visitor. But its stately trees, sweeping views of the Pacific Ocean and craggy cliffs were not why Scott Gardiner needed to be reminded once or twice that it was his turn to hit during the first round of the Farmers Insurance Open.Gardiner struck up a conversation with a few teenage fans in his gallery, he said, “and I got sidetracked.”On his way to blazing a trail on the PGA Tour, Gardiner dealt with a decade of diversions, playing in at least one event on the Web.com Tour, golf’s Class AAA circuit in every year from 2003 to 2012 before earning his playing privileges this year. At 36, Gardiner is the oldest rookie on the PGA Tour, and he is also the first indigenous Australian to earn his full-time playing privileges.Gardiner, whose roots are in a working-class Sydney suburb, is the product of a foundation created to identify and develop the Australian Tiger Woods. It was a thrill for him to play at Torrey Pines, where Woods has won six tour events and one United States Open and stood as the 36-hole leader for the second consecutive day after dense fog led to the suspension of Saturday’s third round.“It’s pretty neat to be standing here at Torrey Pines, at a tournament that I’ve watched numerous years, and really finding out how good Tiger is, shooting 11 under,” Gardiner said after making the weekend cut with no strokes to spare at one under par. “I played about as good as I can play, and he’s 10 shots better.”On Friday, Gardiner and Steve LeBrun, who were in the final pairing on the South Course, had birdie putts on their last hole. If they made them, then the native San Diegan Phil Mickelson, a three-time champion who was on the cut line at minus 1, would be swept out of the tournament.Each missed, allowing Mickelson a new lease on the weekend. A good thing because Gardiner exudes such goodness he would have made a lousy Public Enemy No. 1 or 1A for Mickelson’s many fans.“He’s getting a lot of attention because he’s Aboriginal,” said David Hill, who caddied for another Australian, Cameron Percy. “But it’s the kind of attention that he should be getting because he’s a great bloke.”Percy, 38, who also started playing on the Web.com Tour in 2003, described Gardiner, who has an Aboriginal mother and a Scottish father, as “incredibly unique.”He elaborated: “He’ll be playing fantastic, and then he’ll try three sets of irons, four drivers and three putters on the Sunday night of a golf tournament. Then he’ll be traveling to the next tournament and you’ll say, ‘Where are you staying, Scotty?’ and he’ll say, ‘I haven’t quite booked that yet.’ ”Gardiner’s appearance is a sight gag. Imagine Oscar Madison dressed in golf attire and you have the picture.“It’s not uncommon to see Scotty’s hat on sideways, the shirt kind of out, and there might be a little bit of food in his mouth,” said Hill, who is acting as Gardiner’s manager. “He’ll just smile at you and move right along.”Gardiner shrugged at the suggestion that he is “out there,” as Hill suggested.“You’ve got to find ways to alleviate stress,” Gardiner said, adding, “If you’re just looking at your yardage book all day, you’re not going to be much company to anybody.”When Gardiner glanced up from his yardage book Thursday, he noticed a handful of teenagers. He wandered over to the ropes and asked why they were not in class.Gardiner found out they were on a high school golf team and had received permission to leave early to watch the tournament. They returned home with balls that Gardiner dug out of his bag.“When I was a kid, I got to volunteer at some tournaments,” he said. “I know how big a thrill it was for me just to see the struggling pro in Australia, for them to acknowledge you or throw you a ball. Any pro that came through was a hero of somebody. That’s what inspired me to want to play the game.”Gardiner played soccer as a child and, in his early teenage years, competed in the discus.“I think I was the skinniest discus thrower in the country,” said the 5-foot-11 Gardiner, who has filled out to 182 pounds.He decided on golf as a career after he was invited to join a program, started after Woods began winning majors and administered through the National Aboriginal Sports Corporation, to encourage Aboriginal children to take up golf.As the program’s most successful golfer, Gardiner has a high profile. He began the season at the Sony Open in Hawaii being shadowed by a documentary filmmaker for a 30-minute short. He finished tied for 15th.“It’s been an advantage for me to be Aboriginal,” Gardiner said. “There’s people of similar ability to me who didn’t get maybe some of the backing that I did, which enabled me to bridge the gap between being a good amateur and having the chance to turn professional.”Gardiner turned pro in 2000 and made 199 starts over 10 years on the lower-level tour, earning $1.6 million. It was enough to pay his bills, he said, so he did not fret over the fact he was not on the PGA Tour. One year, Gardiner missed earning his card by less than $2,000. He qualified for the 2013 season by finishing 15th on the Web.com money list last year.And now, here he is, competing against Woods, who is indirectly responsible for Gardiner’s career.“It’s pretty cool,” he said. “Tiger’s done amazing things for golf.”Gardiner is the living proof."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/giants-tim-flannery-has-gift-for-coaching-and-carrying-a-tune.html,"The back-spinning, bases-clearing grounder that Hunter Pence and his broken bat cued past the St. Louis Cardinals’ infield in October sent the San Francisco Giants’ third-base coach, Tim Flannery, to work. Frantically windmilling his arm, Flannery sent Buster Posey all the way home from first base to complete the three-run double and propel the Giants toward victory in Game 7 of the National League Championship Series.In recalling that play recently, Flannery said he remembered yelling, “Come on, Buster!” while silently exulting that the Giants were, remarkably enough, on their way to winning three in a row against the Cardinals to complete a dramatic N.L.C.S. comeback. Not only that, they were doing it in exactly the same way that they had stormed back against Cincinnati in the first round of the playoffs.“We’ve got angels,” he said to himself as Posey headed toward the plate.That was late October as the Giants moved toward their second World Series title in three seasons, a great moment for the 55-year-old Flannery, a baseball lifer who lasted 11 years in the major leagues as a self-described “grunt.” He managed in the minors and then began more than a decade of manning the third-base coach’s box, first in San Diego and now in San Francisco, and always for Bruce Bochy, his manager in both cities.But there is a whole other side to Flannery, an accomplished bluegrass guitarist, songwriter and vocalist with more CDs to his name (11) than career home runs (9). Not many people can say they have shared a clubhouse with Tony Gwynn, Goose Gossage and Barry Bonds and also opened for Willie Nelson, Merle Haggard, Linda Ronstadt, Dwight Yoakam and Judy Collins.Flannery can. He also plays with Bob Weir, a founder of the Grateful Dead; got Jackson Browne to sing harmony with him on one of Flannery’s CDs; and, with Weir, sang the national anthem before several Giants games.And with Weir’s help, Flannery and his band, The Lunatic Fringe, are spending this weekend performing in a series of San Francisco-area concerts to raise money to assist Bryan Stow, a Giants fan who was severely beaten in the parking lot of Dodger Stadium after watching his team play on opening day in 2011.It is the second year in a row that Flannery is doing such concerts, with proceeds going to a fund that Ann and David Stow established for their son’s long-term care. It is all part of who Flannery is, a person raised with music and faith who has stayed loyal to baseball and whose philosophy, if it had to be summarized, would be that everyone, in all facets of life, is a role player.“He’s a very selfless person,” Ann Stow said. “He could have had one concert, and that would have been the end of it. His concerts are all about love and to raise awareness about hate and hate crimes.”Now 43, Bryan Stow remains wheelchair-bound, cognitively impaired, his career as a paramedic over, his mother said in a recent telephone interview. He probably will never work again, and he’s slowly relearning how to walk.A trial date for the two suspects in the case is to be set next month. The family’s $50 million lawsuit against the Dodgers on grounds they provided inadequate security at the stadium is scheduled to be argued in a Los Angeles court in May, Ann Stow said.Meanwhile, last year’s concerts and an accompanying silent auction and DVD sales, Flannery said, raised about $70,000 for Stow, a divorced father of two children.“If you honor the game of baseball, it honors you; if you honor music, it honors you,” Flannery said. “This is how I can help. They’re the ones who raise the money. I raise the music.”Music helped shape Flannery. His mother, Joyce, sang in churches where his father, Ragon, was the minister. His grandmother, Audrey Flannery, played the banjo, and his maternal uncle, Hal Smith, wrote songs, although he is better known for hitting a three-run homer for Pittsburgh late in Game 7 of the 1960 World Series against the Yankees.Growing up in Anaheim, Calif., Tim and his brother, Tom, shared a bunk bed, where “one would sing a hymn and the other would sing harmony, and that’s how we fell asleep each night,” said Tom Flannery, a teacher of music and choir in Kentucky.From their father, the boys and their sister, Rajean, learned empathy. Tom Flannery remembered their father opening his church to prepare for services, but first distributing coffee and doughnuts to homeless people who were waiting.“He’d be the one who’d help them and listen to them and talk to them,” Tom Flannery said. His father’s message, he said, was “forgiveness, compassion and charity.”Others in the Giants family have also gotten involved on Stow’s behalf, including the chief executive, Larry Baer; Manager Bruce Bochy; and pitchers Jeremy Affeldt, Tim Lincecum and Barry Zito, who played guitar with Flannery in one of last year’s concerts.But it is Flannery who is leading the way. He lives much of the off-season in a house in the Santa Barbara area that is solar-powered and somewhat isolated. He hikes, surfs and chops wood and gets ready for another season of sending his players around third and toward home.Which is where Stow could be headed by April, when he trades the rehabilitation center where he has been living near Bakersfield, Calif., for his parents’ house in Santa Cruz. Neighbors and community groups recently finished refitting the house for him, including constructing a concrete ramp outside and widening doorways.The renovations were free. Neighbors contributed their labor, and local businesses supplied the materials, Ann Stow said. And you might say all of it was set to music, provided by Tim Flannery."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sports/baseball/yankees-robertson-agrees-to-deal.html,"NEW YORK (AP) — Reliever David Robertson will earn $3.1 million under his one-year contract with the Yankees, a deal that increases New York’s projected payroll to about $206 million.Robertson had asked for $3.55 million in salary arbitration and the Yankees offered $2.85 million. He made $1,625,000 last season, when the 27-year-old right-hander was 2-7 with a 2.67 ERA in an injury-filled year. He was an All-Star in 2011, when he went 4-0 with a 1.08 ERA.Robertson bruised his right foot in a spring training fall at home last March. He was given the closer’s job after Mariano Rivera’s season-ending knee injury in May, then went on the disabled list from mid-May until mid-June because of a strained left oblique. Rafael Soriano took over as closer for the rest of the season.New York’s payroll for 17 signed played on the 40-man roster is $197.3 million following Friday’s deal with Robertson. The Yankees also owe Pittsburgh $8.5 million as part of last February’s trade that sent pitcher A.J. Burnett to the Pirates.¶ Reliever Matt Lindstrom, 32, and the Chicago White Sox agreed to a one-year, $2.8 million contract that includes a club option for 2014.

With little hesitation, he began whizzing around town in his new sports car. He was 22. He was an athlete. He was giddy.He was also, as it turned out, not particularly adept at judging distances. The problem with the Corvette was that its hood was elongated, stretching “like 10 feet out in front of the windshield,” he said.One day, while approaching a stop sign, he slammed into the car in front of him. The man in the other car threw open his door, clearly not happy.But then, abruptly, the man stopped. He stood, peering into the Corvette. And then he smiled. “Hey, Arch!” he called out, and then screamed, “Go Saints!” Then the man got back in his car and drove away.Sitting on his couch this month while recalling the story, Manning laughed. “Yep,” he said. “That was pretty much the beginning.”The beginning of Manning’s stardom, yes, but even more the beginning of a love, an affection, a relationship between a family and a city. There is, to be sure, widespread disappointment that neither Peyton nor Eli Manning will be playing in the Super Bowl next Sunday, but that does not mean there will not be a Manning quarterback drawing cheers and signing autographs and shaking hands all week.Archie, perhaps the most famous New Orleans quarterback of all, is here. He always has been.“He’s the first citizen of this city, that’s the only way I can say it,” James Carville, the political consultant and New Orleans resident, said in an interview. “He’s the one.”The city’s abiding love for Archie Manning is not complicated. New Orleanians embrace him because he passed here and ran here, but also because he stayed here. He was the quarterback for the Saints from 1971 to 1982, a sharp-jawed, redheaded constant in a period of perpetual coaching changes, unstable executive structure and, most memorably, an incredible run of really, really bad football.As the losses piled up, seemingly everyone left the organization at one point or another, except Archie. He stayed for the 2-12 team in 1975 and the 3-11 team in 1977. He saw 2-11-1 in 1972 and 1-15 in 1980. Then he saw three boys grow up. Then he saw Hurricane Katrina. Then he saw the recovery.“He had every reason to leave,” Carville said. “He could have. But he didn’t.”The Journey From MississippiTechnically, the Mannings are transplants. Archie was born in the Delta, in Drew, Miss., and his wife, Olivia, is from Philadelphia, Miss., about 140 miles southeast of Drew. New Orleans is also not the only city to claim the Mannings as local royalty. In Oxford, Miss., where Archie and Eli both starred at quarterback for Mississippi, the speed limit on campus is 18 miles an hour — in honor of Archie’s jersey number — and the speed limit on Manning Way, the road around the football stadium, is 10 m.p.h. — in honor of Eli’s.Given those connections, it is hardly surprising that Archie and Olivia initially planned to return to Mississippi. “That was always our intention,” Archie said. “It was just going to be temporary here.”Mississippi was in their blood. The Mannings met at Ole Miss, and married during their senior year. They moved to Louisiana after Archie was selected second over all in the 1971 N.F.L. draft.When Olivia came to New Orleans to look at houses, she did not cast a wide net. She looked in Metairie, and only Metairie, because that was the one area that she or Archie had heard anything about. “It’s where the Saints trained,” Archie said. “So that’s where we lived.”Their first apartment — “they called it a penthouse because we had a patio,” Archie said — was memorable because it was not far from Drago’s, a restaurant where charbroiled oysters are said to have been invented. Listening from the kitchen while Archie lovingly recalled the oysters, Olivia called out, “You’re really going down memory lane now, aren’t you?” A moment later though, she added, “They were really very good.”It did not take long for the Mannings to become attached to New Orleans. During his rookie minicamp, Archie went with several other players to the old Municipal Auditorium to see the local middleweight boxer Tony Licata. The players went out afterward, and the next morning, Saints Coach J. D. Roberts sat them down before practice. “Now listen,” Manning recalled Roberts saying gravely. “You know you’re not going to be making a habit of going down there, right?”Generally, Archie did not. But it was difficult to ignore the allure of New Orleans, particularly because the players were generally treated well. After the Saints upset Los Angeles in Archie’s first game, a large group retired to the French Quarter for a long dinner at the Rib Room. He says he is not quite sure where they went next, but there is a good chance the famed bar Pat O’Brien’s was involved.“It wasn’t like people ever go to bed early around here,” Archie said laughing, and it did not take long for him and Olivia to fall in love with the overflowing options for art and music and the sort of food that makes the back of your tongue tingle. Near the top of their list was the barbecue shrimp at Pascal’s Manale restaurant, and the Mannings would gladly wait the 90 minutes it often took to get in there.“Except on Sunday night,” Archie said. “On Sunday night, after games, we got right in. On Wednesday, we waited like everyone else.”The only thing wrong was the football. This was not altogether unfamiliar territory — Manning is one of the most celebrated college players even though Ole Miss was only 15-7 over his last two seasons — yet the Saints’ play sank to particularly pungent depths.The Saints lost — a lot — and Archie never played on a team with a winning record. He also was hit — a lot — being sacked 340 times during his Saints career. It got so bad that fans often referred to the team as the Aints and wore bags on their heads at games. The Manning family nadir came when Olivia looked around during one particularly loud cavalcade of boos and realized that her oldest son, Cooper, then about 7 and sitting next to her, was joining the chorus.“Yeah, I did it,” Cooper said. “I booed. Everyone else was doing it and you know, it’s a copycat league.”He laughed and said, “I mean, 1-15 is 1-15!” Despite Archie’s being pummeled on a near-weekly basis, he and Olivia were becoming more attached to their new home. When Peyton was born in 1976, joining Cooper, who had arrived two years earlier, the Mannings discussed moving to a larger house. For a moment, they considered another place in the suburbs. Then, Olivia said to Archie, “There’s a million suburbs — there’s only one Uptown,” and the family ended up buying a charming camelback cottage on Seventh Street in the neighborhood.There, Peyton and Cooper shared a room upstairs that had originally been the master bedroom where they wrestled, played knee-high football and even created their own version of indoor tennis that featured “some of the longest points ever,” Cooper recalled, because the ball was soft and squishy like a balloon.The family became embedded in New Orleans. The children played in Audubon Park. Archie loved running on St. Charles Avenue. On special occasions, the family might go to Ruth’s Chris for dinner; on most Saturdays, they went for the messy po’boy sandwiches and Barq’s root beers at the famed Domilise’s.Even when Archie was traded to Houston in 1982, he essentially commuted, flying to New Orleans — “On Southwest, it was only $29!” he said — whenever he could. Sometimes, Olivia put Cooper or Peyton on a flight to go see their father play, and Archie had Oliver Luck, the father of the current Colts quarterback Andrew Luck but then just a rookie quarterback with the Oilers, take care of them. Often, after quarterback meetings were finished, Oliver took Peyton to McDonald’s. Then after the game, Archie would put his sons on a plane back home.It was not ideal, but the family did not want to leave New Orleans. In 1984, after Archie had been traded to the Minnesota Vikings in the middle of the previous season, the family rented a house in Minnetonka. One morning in November, they woke to find several feet of snow covering the backyard.Olivia seemed unimpressed. She kept staring at a tiny pond that was in the back. “Where are all the ducks?” she said. “It’s cold, so I guess they flew south,” Archie answered with a shrug.Olivia nodded. “They went south?” she said. “Well, so am I.”That off-season, the Mannings returned to New Orleans for good.By the time Archie retired, Eli, who was born in 1981, was 4 and the family had moved into what would become known around New Orleans as “the Manning house.” Sitting in the middle of the Garden District, it is a historic home and remains a frequent stop on tours of the area. It has high ceilings, pretty flowers in the yard, a swimming pool and a view from the backyard of another stately New Orleans house that was once home to the musician Trent Reznor and is currently occupied by the actor John Goodman.When the three Manning boys were young, though, their home was mostly a place for sports. Most memorably for the boys, there was a game they called ’Mazing Catches — “No ‘a,’ ” Cooper said — which involved Archie standing on the porch and firing passes that were just out in front of the boys as they ran across the lawn. “If it was a little wet and you could dive and slide, that was the big play,” Eli said. “We were probably a little spoiled having a professional quarterback throwing to us.”Even though Archie was no longer playing, his popularity did not wane. He had moved into broadcasting, working as a game analyst on the Saints’ radio network and serving as a spokesman for several companies. Eli said he did not remember a time when his father did not have people coming up to him asking for autographs.“As a kid, it was just something that happened,” Eli said. “That was just what my dad did. It was normal, like — O.K., so, should I go up and ask my friends’ dads for their autographs, too?”When it came to sports, Archie’s general philosophy was to avoid being overbearing, and so he rarely coached his sons’ teams and, if he did, it was usually as an assistant. There was one time, though, when he was a head coach because there were not enough other fathers who volunteered.“It was basketball, and Peyton was little,” Archie said, shaking his head. “There was a draft; there were tryouts for all the kids and then the coaches put the teams together. But I couldn’t go to the tryout, so at the draft, I just drafted all my friends’ kids because I thought that would be nice for everyone to play together.”Archie sighed.“Well, we were terrible,” he said. “We were very bad. And Peyton got really mad at me. ‘Why did you draft these guys? What’s wrong with you?’ He was really competitive. And so that’s when I quit being a head coach.”A Proud HostArchie smiled as he reminisced about his sons growing up in New Orleans. The boys embraced the city, too, he said: Eli, the baby of the family, was known to sometimes go antiquing with his mother and as they got older, all three began stopping in at Domilise’s for po’boys on their own. Sometimes, Eli would even work a little for Miss Dot, the woman who ran the place. Even now, decades later, Peyton was mortified when Cooper texted him this season to inform him that there were no photographs on the wall of Peyton in a Denver Broncos uniform. “They’re in the mail right now,” he texted back almost immediately.“I think we all saw how much the city meant to our parents,” Eli said. “And there is no doubt that it translated to us. New Orleans is a part of us.”The family has spread over the years. Peyton went to Tennessee for college, then lived in Indianapolis and now Denver. Eli lives in New Jersey and keeps a place in Oxford for downtime during the off-season. After Hurricane Katrina, however, they immediately returned to New Orleans, teaming with the Red Cross to bring food and clothes and supplies to those affected by the storm.Their family house, where Archie and Olivia still live, escaped with only minor damage, though Cooper, who works as an energy trader, did have to deal with more significant repairs to his family’s home.In the years since the storm, Archie said, he and Olivia never considered leaving. “How could we?” he said, and he has reveled in seeing his grandchildren play on the same lawn where his sons did. Each summer, he and the boys run the Manning Passing Academy for aspiring quarterbacks and he has watched with pride as his adopted city has risen again. This week, as the city is overrun with football, Archie says he expects to be busy making appearances and signing autographs, and checking in on the way things are going at Manning’s, the restaurant he owns downtown.Carville even joked that if N.F.L. Commissioner Roger Goodell is looking for someone to protect him from all the angry Saints fans still furious over the discipline he imposed after the bounty scandal, all Goodell needs to do is walk around town with Archie.“That’s one way to stay safe,” Carville said, laughing. “Personal bodyguard, guaranteed.”Archie, of course, would be happy to do it. “We need to be good hosts,” he said earnestly, before rattling off the previous nine Super Bowls that have been played in New Orleans. He concluded, “The city is perfect for games like this.”Then he leaned back on the couch and began listing what he loves about New Orleans. The World War II museum. The energy. The food. The people. On and on he went.“It’s home,” he said finally, and he smiled. No, a Manning quarterback is not playing in the Super Bowl next Sunday, but that does not mean one is not here. The most famous Manning quarterback in New Orleans has always been the one who never left."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/football/in-new-orleans-the-biggest-drama-is-off-the-field.html,"When the Super Bowl has been in New Orleans, the game itself has sometimes been an afterthought. Already, the most popular story lines for the 49ers-Ravens collision there include the Harbaugh coaching family, Baltimore linebacker Ray Lewis’s last ride, and how rudely the Saints die-hards on Bourbon Street will greet Commissioner Roger Goodell.Other unusual subplots have surfaced there in the past, including a television network’s linking the Chiefs’ quarterback to a gambler, a president’s suggestion that the Dolphins use a certain pass pattern, a commissioner’s having to present the Vince Lombardi Trophy to a team owner suing the N.F.L., and a Patriots coach’s imminent departure, win or lose.One by one, Super Bowls in the Crescent City were often as spicy as the Cajun food.EARLY IN THE WEEK BEFORE SUPER BOWL IV, NBC reported that Chiefs quarterback Len Dawson would be subpoenaed by a grand jury in a federal gambling case involving Donald Dawson, known as Dice. Len Dawson acknowledged a “casual acquaintanceship” with Dice but insisted he was completely innocent. The N.F.L. branded the rumors “unsubstantiated.” Law enforcement authorities apparently agreed. The Chiefs routed the Vikings, 23-7, as Dawson completed 12 of 17 passes, including a 46-yarder for a touchdown to wide receiver Otis Taylor, and President Nixon phoned his congratulations to Coach Hank Stram and Dawson.TWO YEARS LATER, during Nixon’s congratulatory phone call to Coach Don Shula in the hours after the A.F.C. championship game, he suggested the Dolphins use a down-and-in pass from quarterback Bob Griese to wide receiver Paul Warfield in Super Bowl VI against the Cowboys. They did, but the pass was incomplete — and inconsequential. The Cowboys won, 24-3.ART ROONEY BOUGHT THE PITTSBURGH FRANCHISE FOR $2,500 IN 1933, but in its first four decades, the franchise not only never won a title, but also traded or cut three eventual Hall of Fame quarterbacks: Sid Luckman, Johnny Unitas and Len Dawson. But in IX, the last Super Bowl at old, rickety Tulane Stadium, the Steelers of Franco Harris, Terry Bradshaw, Lynn Swann, John Stallworth, Joe Greene, Jack Lambert, Jack Ham, Mel Blount and Coach Chuck Noll presented Rooney with the Lombardi Trophy after a 16-6 domination of the Vikings.THE XII GAME, the first Super Bowl at the Louisiana Superdome, the architectural marvel of its time, had a simple story line: Craig Morton, the Cowboys’ quarterback in their V loss to the Baltimore Colts, was now the Broncos’ quarterback and facing his old team. But Morton threw four interceptions, and the Cowboys ran out to a 13-0 halftime lead en route to a 27-10 win behind Roger Staubach.TO THE DISTRESS OF COMMISSIONER PETE ROZELLE AND TEAM OWNERS, Al Davis was scheming to move the Raiders to Los Angeles, which he later did for the 1982 season while winning an antitrust suit. So after his Oakland team qualified for XV, the question was, if the Raiders won, would Rozelle present the Lombardi Trophy to Davis? The answer: the Raiders forced a 27-10 win over the Eagles on linebacker Rod Martin’s three interceptions, and in a cool but casual ceremony in the Raiders’ locker room, Rozelle forced a smile.THE BEARS ARRIVED FOR XX SINGING, “We’re not here to start no trouble; we’re just here to do the Super Bowl Shuffle.” But a New Orleans radio sportscaster, Buddy Diliberto, stirred the trouble, reporting that quarterback Jim McMahon had insulted New Orleans and its women in a Chicago radio interview. (It never existed.) Diliberto renounced his story, was suspended by his station and had to watch the Bears crush the Patriots, 46-10, as William Perry, the 308-pound defensive tackle known as the Fridge, scored on a 1-yard plunge.BILL WALSH HAD RETIRED FROM COACHING WITH THE 49ERS’ THIRD LOMBARDI TROPHY, so in XXIV, could George Seifert, an older but rookie head coach who had been Walsh’s defensive coordinator, maintain the monarchy? Joe Montana answered that question, earning his third Super Bowl Most Valuable Player trophy by firing five touchdown passes, including three to Jerry Rice, in a 55-10 rout of the Broncos.COACH BILL PARCELLS, who had guided the Giants to two trays of Super Bowl rings, led the Patriots into XXXI amid reports that he would soon leave to join the Jets. Curtis Martin ran 18 yards for a touchdown to bring the Patriots within a score of the Packers late in the third quarter, but Desmond Howard’s 99-yard kickoff return clinched a 35-21 victory for Green Bay. Parcells didn’t fly back with the team, and he resigned five days later. When the Patriots objected to his hiring by the Jets, Commissioner Paul Tagliabue ruled that the Jets had to send the Patriots four high draft picks.IN COACH BILL BELICHICK’S SECOND SEASON AS COACH, the young quarterback Tom Brady led the Patriots into the A.F.C. championship game at Pittsburgh, but when Brady was injured, his predecessor, Drew Bledsoe, finished the 24-17 triumph. Would Belichick now start Bledsoe in XXXVI against the Rams? No. After the Patriots’ defense converted three turnovers into 17 points, Brady completed five of eight passes in the final 81 seconds before Adam Vinatieri kicked a 48-yard field goal for a 20-17 win as time expired.And now, in New Orleans’s 10th appearance as the Super Bowl host, tying the Miami area’s total, there is still time for another strange story line to surface before Sunday night’s kickoff."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/football/ravens-joe-flacco-betrays-quiet-persona-in-wedding-photos.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — For all his glowing credentials as the quarterback of the Super Bowl-bound Baltimore Ravens, Joe Flacco does not present himself to the public as the most charismatic human being to ever grace a football field, and that is no act. Just ask his father, Steve.“Joe is dull,” Steve Flacco said in a telephone interview. “As dull as he is portrayed in the media, he’s that dull. He is dull.”Yet there was one day in the not-so-distant past when Joe Flacco actually cut loose.It was June 25, 2011, his wedding day, and it lives on in a handful of silly photographs that have become nearly as much a part of Flacco’s public persona as his plutonium-powered throwing arm.“I never thought it would get as big as it did,” said Jason Prezant, the photographer who shot the wedding.Flacco and his wife, Dana, are celebrated as something close to royalty in Baltimore and back home in New Jersey, where they married. Their nuptials were a big deal. Two other Ravens married the same day, including Morgan Cox, the team’s long snapper. None of his photographs became Internet sensations.“Everybody loves goofy wedding photos,” Cox said.The pressure was on for Prezant, who had three hours before the reception to capture the Flaccos and their wedding party for posterity.The first stop was the Cinemark 16 movie theater in Somerdale, N.J., which the group rented out for 45 minutes. After handing out 3-D glasses and boxes of popcorn to the group, Prezant put the props to good use, directing Flacco, his wife and their friends to pretend they were watching a scary movie.“I don’t think anything was even showing,” Prezant said.Flacco has no formal theater training, and he apparently interpreted “act scared” as a direction to open his mouth as wide as is humanly possible. His wife, on the other hand, looks genuinely frightened, going so far as to toss her popcorn in the air. Flacco did not spill a single kernel. Prezant said he felt awful for the custodians who had to clean up the mess. Such is the cost of fine art.Flacco found his rhythm at the group’s second stop, the football field at Audubon High School, where he had starred. Prezant said he did not need to give much direction. Everyone more or less followed Flacco’s lead and got into position, with Flacco lined up at quarterback. With four groomsmen to the right and four to the left, Dana Flacco crouched down as the center at the line of scrimmage and prepared to snap her husband a bouquet of flowers. In the photograph, Flacco surveys the field and even calls an audible while clutching a bottle of Champagne in his right hand.That photograph, more than any other, was the one that went bananas online. The Web site Deadspin posted it under the headline: “Joe Flacco’s New Bride Is a Very Understanding Woman.” Steve Flacco said he suspected that Joe’s four brothers were the brains behind the operation.“I guarantee none of it was Joe’s idea,” Steve Flacco said.From a creative standpoint, the rest of the day was far more conventional. Prezant took photographs of the couple at an intersection along Broad Street in Philadelphia and later at their reception at Penn’s Landing, near the Delaware River.Several weeks later, Prezant, who is based in Wilmington, Del., posted the photographs on his Web site. Within an hour, the Internet server that hosted his site and about 300 others crashed. Once the server got up and running again, Prezant’s site had 250,000 unique visitors within 48 hours.Flacco is not the most coveted pitchman in professional athletics. He has low-key sponsorship deals with 1st Mariner Bank and Al Packer Ford, and these seem to suit him just fine.And when it comes to the business of selling stuff, nobody seems to be craving more Flacco commercials. Yet his endorsement of Prezant’s work did big things for the photographer, who said his business picked up after the wedding.“I mean, it’s not crazy out of control,” Prezant said. “It’s not like I’m photographing a hundred other football players’ weddings.”The photographs humanized Flacco, if only briefly. He has not become more vocal on the field since getting married.Flacco is set to become a free agent after the Super Bowl, and it stands to reason that he will make a small fortune. If this excites him, he has kept it to himself.“I’ve never seen a guy less concerned about a contract,” said Joe Linta, his agent.This is Flacco. No ups or downs, just calm and cool — except for one day back in 2011, when he revealed more of himself than he ever had, or maybe ever will."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/golf/tiger-woods-in-the-lead-at-the-farmers-insurance-open.html,"SAN DIEGO — The fog enshrouding his game as Tiger Woods worked on his third major swing change began to lift last year, when he won three times. But the gloom loomed on the weekends, adding to the intrigue of Woods’s play Sunday at the Farmers Insurance Open.After the third round was pushed back by a stubborn marine layer that cloaked Torrey Pines on Saturday, Woods entered a long day of golf with a two-stroke lead and one burning question: After all his tinkering, has he weekend-proofed his game?There wasn’t much leaking Sunday. Woods birdied two of his first three holes but bogeyed his last — the first time in 13 trips here as a pro that he made a 6 on 18 — on his way to a three-under-par 69. At minus-14, Woods lengthened his lead to four strokes over Brad Fritsch, a PGA Tour rookie from Canada, who carded a 70.In the late afternoon Woods started a fourth round he had no hope of finishing by missing the first three fairways. His tee shots were loose, but he kept a firm grip on the lead. He was 17 under through 61 holes, leading by six shots, when play was suspended because of darkness.“Over all, I’m very pleased that I was able to build on my lead,” Woods said.He added: “I’ve got to continue to execute my game plan. That’s the idea. I’ve got 11 holes to play, and I’ve got to go out there and play them well.”Fritsch, 35, who earned his spot on tour by finishing tied for seventh at last month’s qualifying school, spent the day in the group directly ahead of Woods, which gave him the pleasure, as he described it, of experiencing the tail end of the Tiger streak of fans.“There is a little more traffic-directing going on than I’m used to,” said Fritsch, who joked, “It would be a really interesting tournament if he wasn’t here, in terms of the scoring.”Brandt Snedeker, the 2012 winner in Woods’s absence, suggested before the start of the tournament that it would be infinitely more interesting because Woods was in it.“He adds a little bit more electricity to the tournament,” said Snedeker, a four-time tour winner who sent a current through the leader board with his Sunday charge.After a wobbly second-round 75, Snedeker climbed back with a 69. He began the final round at seven under but moved within three of Woods with four birdies on the front nine.Snedeker came from well back in the pack in the final round last year to tie Kyle Stanley, whom he defeated on the second hole of a playoff.Woods’s tee shots bent, but he did not break stride. He dropped an 11-foot birdie putt at No. 3, chipped in for a birdie at the par-4 fourth and made a tap-in birdie at the par-5 sixth to stay comfortably ahead of Snedeker (11 under through 67) and Nick Watney, the 2009 champion (11 under through 62).“I’ve got a guy at the top of the leader board that doesn’t like giving up leads,” Snedeker said, “so I have to go catch him.”Woods had built a reputation as the most formidable closer in golf, at one point winning 18 consecutive events in which he held at least a share of the 36-hole lead. But in recent years his weekend performance has dropped off precipitously.Sixteen times in 2012, Woods played 72 holes, and in 10 of those events, his second 36 score was worse than his opening 36. He failed to convert four of his previous six second-round leads on the tour.Woods, 37, won last year’s Arnold Palmer Invitational while playing with a lead on the weekend, his first such front-running victory since the 2009 BMW Championship. But in two other events, the United States Open and the P.G.A. Championship, he was tied for the 36-hole lead only to finish outside the top 10.For a reading of Woods’s game under pressure, there are few better barometers than Torrey Pines’s South Course, site of 6 of his 74 tour victories and 1 of his 14 major titles, the 2008 United States Open.Woods knows the fairways’ curves and the greens’ slopes like the lines on his palm. His career scoring average at Torrey Pines going into this year’s event was 68.62, nearly four under par, and he further whittled away at it by opening with scores of 68 and 65.Woods was tied for second in driving distance for the week with Dustin Johnson, behind Robert Garrigus. In his third round, he missed three greens and the longest birdie putt he faced was six feet.As the tournament headed into the first Monday finish in its 61-year history, Woods had positive memories to draw upon. He has converted 49 of 53 third-round leads, including his last two. And at the 2008 United States Open, he defeated Rocco Mediate in a Monday playoff.Woods is not the same player he was five years ago. But with his crisp irons and clutch short game, he showed Sunday that he is getting closer.“All we can do tomorrow is go out and try to make him think about it a little bit,” Watney said, “and see what happens.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/golf/proposed-golf-rule-changes-pushes-long-putters-out-of-style.html,"ORLANDO, Fla. — A buzz surrounded the variety of belly-length and long putters found throughout the showroom floor at last year’s annual PGA Merchandise Show at Orange County Convention Center. But at this year’s event, the biggest buzz around these overlength clubs was their destiny.That destiny now lies in the hands of the United States Golf Association and the Royal & Ancient, golf’s governing bodies, which in November proposed changes to golf’s Rule 14-1, which says the ball is “to be fairly struck at.” The change would prohibit anchoring a club against the body to make a golf stroke.“This decision could cost us time and money, but we are a small manufacturing company and we’re not planning to sue the U.S.G.A.,” said Ben Zylstra, the owner of Rife Putters. “It’s a speed bump and it hurts us, but it doesn’t bury us. We’ll have to retool and adjust if they approve the new rule.”Rife jumped to international prominence when Matt Kuchar won the 2012 Players Championship using the company’s Barbados belly putter. Instead of anchoring the putter against his gut, Kuchar rested the grip against his left forearm. That putting style would still be permitted under the proposed rule change.But while Kuchar’s method conformed to the proposed new guidelines, success with belly putters in three recent major championships raised eyebrows. Keegan Bradley (2011 P.G.A. Championship), Webb Simpson (2012 United States Open) and Ernie Els (2012 British Open) won using belly putters.The public also took notice. According to TaylorMade’s Frank Firman, sales of long and belly putters accounted for 12 to 15 percent of the company’s putter sales for much of 2012 but dropped to about 3 percent in December, after the announcement of the proposed rule.“The Tour guys are very influential on the public, and people began to hear the negative talk and feedback about long and belly putters,” said Firman, TaylorMade’s product line manager for putters and wedges. “They didn’t want to be perceived as cheaters if they used these clubs.”According to Firman, TaylorMade’s focus this year will be “market-based.”TaylorMade is no longer manufacturing new long putters and is phasing out belly putters, Firman said.Instead, in April, the company plans to introduce its Daddy Long Legs model, a putter that uses a counterbalance design and has a longer and heavier 15-inch grip that will conform to U.S.G.A. guidelines.“We’re trying to make the game easier for all players, but we’re also going to react as quickly as we can to sales figures,” Firman said.The potential rule change has prompted companies to explore alternative methods in putter production, said Chris Koske, the global director for Callaway’s Odyssey Golf line. Odyssey introduced its Tank model at the merchandise show last week. It, too, uses a counterbalance design to extend the grip to the forearm.Odyssey’s belly putters grabbed headlines when Bradley won the P.G.A. Championship using the company’s Sabertooth putter. The company sold 10,000 of the putters globally, Koske said.But with the current discussion about a rule change, Koske said Odyssey had been forced to take a more “conservative strategy from a supply and production perspective.”“It seems that the players who were using the belly putter showed the exuberance of youth,” Koske said. “Now we’re potentially taking away one of the tools they used for success, plus the new rule could also affect baby boomers and drive people away from golf.”Some companies at the merchandise show declined to comment until the U.S.G.A.’s decision is final. Titleist, which sells two long and three midlength models of Scotty Cameron putters, said retailers might still order its clubs, which remained for sale. Nike Golf said its long putters were still available.The putter giant Ping looked at the U.S.G.A.’s pending decision as incentive to produce the first putter with an adjustable-length shaft that conforms to U.S.G.A. standards.The putters in the company’s Scottsdale TR line adjust to a length of 31 inches, from 38 inches, with the twist of a wrench.“Ping is in favor of innovation, and that’s been our advantage for 53 years,” said Pete Samuels, the company’s director of marketing and communications. “An adjustable shaft is an example of that innovation.”The U.S.G.A.’s comment period, during which the golf industry can weigh in on the proposed rule change, concludes at the end of February. The U.S.G.A. will probably make its final decision this spring. If the proposal passes, the rule will take effect in 2016.“Once the comment period is over, there’s an opportunity to examine the feedback and understand the varying points of view,” said Joe Goode, the U.S.G.A.’s managing director for communications. “And yes, this is a complex issue.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/tennis/djokovic-murray-australian-open.html,"MELBOURNE, Australia — His legs are stronger than in the past. So are his résumé, his nerves and his coaching staff. But Andy Murray still cannot solve the tennis riddle that Novak Djokovic represents at the Australian Open.But then Murray — beaten again in the final on Sunday — is in excellent company.Melbourne and its blue hardcourts are nearly half a world away from the Serbian mountain resort Kopaonik, where Djokovic learned to play the game, and from the less rugged hills of the Côte d’Azur, in Monaco, where he makes his home.But Djokovic, still only 25, has transformed Melbourne Park into his Grand Slam redoubt, the distant outpost where he is toughest to trump, not just for Murray but for all challengers.Djokovic has now won four of his six Grand Slam titles down under. No man has beaten him here since 2010, when Jo-Wilfried Tsonga managed it in five sets in the quarterfinals. Since then, Djokovic has used the tournament as a launching pad to the No. 1 ranking and reeled off three straight Australian Open titles, generating innumerable breaches in opponents’ morale with his ability to rise to the big points and to contort and extend his body in successful pursuit of his foes’ best shots.Murray, his former junior rival in Europe and onetime doubles partner, knows Djokovic’s strengths as well as anyone, and he shares many of them. But on Sunday, after more than holding his own in the early phases, Murray gradually faded — suffering from a toe blister and a surprising inability to break serve — as the top-seeded Djokovic put the finishing touches on his 6-7 (2), 7-6 (3), 6-3, 6-2 victory.What seemed grindingly difficult early — the first two sets required 2 hours 13 minutes — seemed much closer to routine by the end as Djokovic accelerated to win in 3:40, which qualified as a middle-distance final in this age of marathons.“What a joy,” Djokovic said after the match at Rod Laver Arena. “It’s an incredible feeling, winning the trophy once more, and it’s definitely my favorite Grand Slam, my most successful Grand Slam. I love this court.”Djokovic won his first Grand Slam title here in 2008 and is now the first man in the 45-year Open era to win three consecutive Australian Open singles titles. Only two other men have won three or more Australian championships in a row: Jack Crawford, from 1931 to 1933, and Roy Emerson, from 1963 to 1967.But neither of those men, both Australian, nor any other tennis champion has covered the angles and the corners quite like the elastic-limbed Djokovic. He dived to his right midway through the second set to hit a forehand behind the baseline, a modern update in this era of supreme defense to the diving volleys that net-rushers like Boris Becker used to hit.Midway through the fourth set, as he was taking control for good, he sprinted to his left and skidded into nearly a full split with his back to the net as he hit a towering defensive lob that rebooted a point, one that Murray eventually lost with an error.Then there were the moments — the trademark moments — when he was pushed wide into what was once considered a vulnerable position and responded with something strong and decisive.“When he’s on defense, he can actually win the point with one shot; that’s an evolution of the game,” said Andre Agassi, a four-time Australian Open champion who handed Djokovic the trophy Sunday night.Agassi continued, “It’s remarkable to watch him play so far behind the baseline, to watch him play so far inside the baseline, to watch him be so defensive, to watch him be so offensive, watch how he upsets the spin and how he creates his own set of rules out there.”Murray, another supreme defender, can thrive by those rules, too, just not quite yet in Melbourne.“His record here is obviously incredible,” Murray said of Djokovic.Murray has lost all three of his matches against Djokovic in Melbourne Park. He was soundly beaten, 6-4, 6-2, 6-3, in the 2011 final and was beaten last year in a five-set thriller of a semifinal that was a harbinger of Murray’s greater performances to come.Murray defeated Djokovic on his way to the Olympic gold medal in London and then in an epic five-set final at the United States Open to win his first Grand Slam singles title.But he could not use that for leverage in Australia and has now dropped to 1-5 in Grand Slam singles finals.Before this final, Murray had said that he was “ready for the pain,” but he was presumably not referring to foot pain. He was treated for a blister after losing the second set, and when the match was over and Djokovic was celebrating, Murray sat on his seat, removed his shoes, tossed them aside and raised his racket high as if to smash it in frustration.He refrained while also refraining from using his foot problem as an excuse, even if there were many a grim face among the sizable Murray entourage.“I very rarely get blisters, but, I mean, 90 percent of the players on the tour will have played this tournament with some sort of blister or problem,” Murray said. “It had no bearing at all on the result. It just hurts a little bit when you run.”Running, and then running some more, is an obligation when Murray and Djokovic meet. Although both players cracked with more regularity than usual (Djokovic had 61 unforced errors to 47 winners), there were still double-digit rallies in abundance as they mixed spins and paces with surgical care and fought for breath when the running was done.“When you’re playing the points like we were there, the positions you’re sort of getting yourself into on the court, you expect those sorts of things,” Murray said of his blister.What was unexpected was that two of the best returners in the world were unable to break each other’s serves at all in the first two and a half sets and that Murray never broke Djokovic’s at all.Murray’s best chance came in the second game of the second set when Djokovic fell behind by 0-40, serving into the wind. But Djokovic put away two forehand volleys, and Murray just missed a backhand on the three break points as Djokovic held firm.“Crucial hold,” Djokovic said. “After that, I just felt mentally a little bit lighter and more confident on the court than I’ve done in the first hour or so.”And then — in the tiebreaker that seemed inevitable — there was the feather. Serving at 2-3 after missing his first serve, Murray prepared to hit his second and then spotted a small feather drifting into his line of sight, one that had come from a bird perched high on the edges of the open roof overhead.Murray stopped his service motion, retrieved the feather before it hit the court and proceeded to double-fault to fall behind, 2-4. He won only one more point in the tiebreaker from there.“It just caught my eye before I served,” he said of the feather. “I thought it was a good idea to move it. Maybe it wasn’t, because I obviously double-faulted.“No, you know, at this level it comes down to just a few points here or there. My probably biggest chance was at the beginning of the second set. Didn’t quite get it. When Novak got his chance at the end of the third, he got his.”The first break of the match came in the third set, with Murray serving at 3-4, and Djokovic broke him twice more in the final set. By then Murray had already squandered his fourth and last break point, missing a backhand return and then whacking himself in the forehead with his racket strings.Murray was presumably not expecting that sort of pain, either, but playing Djokovic on his court, in his redoubt, is a now-annual source of all kinds of misery."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/football/super-bowl-tom-dempsey-former-nfl-kicker-is-dealing-with-dementia.html,"JEFFERSON, La. — “He liked to hit people,” Carlene Dempsey said flatly. “He didn’t care if he got his bell rung.”She was referring to her Falstaffian husband, Tom Dempsey, the former N.F.L. kicker born without toes on his right foot who in November 1970 — after a long night of drinking and debauchery in the French Quarter of New Orleans — set the league record for the longest field goal in a regular-season game. The 63-yard kick lifted the New Orleans Saints to a 19-17 victory over the Detroit Lions, and in the process helped transform Dempsey into a folk hero in the city hosting the Super Bowl on Sunday, the rare Saints player to hold a prominent N.F.L. record before the Sean Payton era.Now 66, Dempsey sat recently with his wife at the dining room table in the modest 1,500-square-foot home they share with their daughter, Ashley, and their grandson, Dylan, in this New Orleans suburb. It quickly became apparent that when reflecting upon his football career, Dempsey seemed to take more delight discussing the hits he had delivered than the kicks he had made.He wistfully recalled how, in high school and college, if his coaches wanted someone on the opposing team knocked out, they usually called on him to deliver a teeth-rattling hit. And his eyes twinkled with glee when he talked about how the coaches he played for over the course of his 10-year N.F.L. career with the Saints, the Eagles, the Rams, the Oilers and the Bills would sometimes call on him to be the wedge buster — football’s version of a kamikaze pilot — on kickoffs.“I would hit anybody,” Dempsey boasted, echoing the sentiment of Carlene, his wife of more than 40 years. “I didn’t care.”The cruel irony in this is that Dempsey’s love of hitting people on the football field may very well be responsible for the syndrome that is slowly depriving him of the hard-hitting memories he so delights in sharing. He is suffering from dementia.In a recent interview, Carlene was by Dempsey’s side to dutifully and lovingly act as fact-checker and blank filler. A couple of times, she prompted him to share a story she knew he would be keen to share. She also did not hesitate to step in and correct him when it appeared his memory was failing him.“I went to Encinitas High School,” he said at one point. That prompted Carlene to say, “No, honey, you went to San Dieguito High School in Encinitas, remember?” He replied, “Oh yeah, that’s right.”Dr. Daniel Amen, a brain disorder specialist who has done extensive studies on football players, made the initial diagnosis of Dempsey. He said he was astonished by the amount of damage he noticed in his brain after getting back the results of some scans.“I wondered, Why does this kicker’s brain look not so good?” Amen said in a phone interview. “Because I was thinking that kickers should have the best-looking brains. But he didn’t.”What Amen later learned is that bygone-era kickers like Dempsey, who was listed at 6 feet 2 inches and 255 pounds, did things on the field that are pretty much unheard-of today: they played other positions on offense and/or defense, as Dempsey did in high school and college, not to mention being vital components on special-teams units — unlike modern kickers, who usually get near a return man only if he manages to get past the 10 other guys on the coverage team, and that is only if the kickoff does not sail out of the end zone for a touchback.After being kicked off the football team at Palomar College for punching one of his coaches, Dempsey was brought into the N.F.L. by Vince Lombardi and the Green Bay Packers in the hopes of turning him into a kicker/offensive lineman in the mold of Lou Groza. But for the first time in his football life, Dempsey was heavily outmatched physically by the famed monsters on the Packers’ defensive line.“I got beat up pretty bad every day in practice,” said Dempsey, who never played a game in a Packers uniform. It was then, he says, that he decided, after a stint playing for a semipro team in Massachusetts, that he wanted to focus exclusively on being a kicker. But again, that did not stop him from hitting people on the football field.Over the course of his career, the Dempseys say, Tom had three concussions that were diagnosed, but that several others likely went undiagnosed. They recalled one game in which Dempsey, after laying a jarring hit on someone after kicking off, was so disoriented that he ran to the wrong sideline and grabbed a seat on the opposing team’s bench. He had to be shown back to his place across the field by an equipment manager, and he later returned to the game.The record Dempsey set more than 42 years ago has since been equaled by three others (Jason Elam, Sebastian Janikowski and David Akers) but has stubbornly gone unsurpassed, a rather remarkable feat given the advanced, year-round training and conditioning programs modern N.F.L. players almost universally participate in.In stark contrast, Dempsey typically spent his off-seasons at home in Southern California working as a bricklayer and as wrestler on the local professional wrestling circuit. (“I was one of the good guys,” he said.) He claims to have even sneaked out of practice a time or two during the season to play golf with buddies.In his time off during the season and during the off-season, Dempsey, who was also born without the fingers on his right hand, drank a lot. He and Carlene were dating at the time of the 63-yard kick — “He courted me mainly at the Old Absinthe House on Bourbon Street,” she said — and she did not hear from him for days afterward.“It was Thursday before he called me,” Carlene said. “I was busy,” Tom replied with a sly smile. He went on to explain that some New Orleans police officers had rewarded him with a couple of cases of cold Dixie beer in the locker room after the game, and it was all downhill from there. But Carlene forgave him, and the two married a few months later.After retiring from football, Tom and Carlene returned to New Orleans, where he worked in the oil field as a salesman until the late 1980s. He then took a job managing a car dealership for the current Saints owner, Tom Benson, in a seedy section of the city.After working for Benson for a couple of years, Dempsey took a sales job with another company and eventually retired in 2008. In retirement, he began to exhibit flashes of what Carlene called “irrational anger,” something she had never seen in him before. Then, in 2010, the couple traveled to Las Vegas for what Carlene termed “an old guys convention” — a gathering of retired N.F.L. players. It was there that they met Amen.“Dr. Amen was talking about guys like Mike Webster who have had brain trouble, and he’s listing all of these symptoms, and I looked at Tom and said, ‘This is you! This is you!,’ ” Carlene said. “He mentioned that he was doing a study on former players, and I told Tom, ‘Go sign up right now.’ And then after he examined Tom, he said, ‘I’m so glad you came in because this is an emergency.’ ”The emergency that Amen spoke of was visible holes, three of them, in the front part of Dempsey’s brain. Now, every Tuesday and Thursday, Dempsey drives to and from the Tulane Institute of Sports Medicine for physical and occupational therapy.“This is not the kind of thing that we’re going to be able to fix,” said Dr. Gregory Stewart, the director of the Neurological Care Program at Tulane’s Institute of Sports Medicine. “What we can do is slow down the progression.”Additionally, Dempsey has lost a considerable amount of weight, which helps to increase the flow of blood to the brain, by getting out to walk the family dogs numerous times each day — despite problems with his fully formed left foot that cause him to hobble a bit — while also paying close attention to what he puts into his body.“I drink tea instead of beer now,” he said, jokingly.Despite his daunting diagnosis, Dempsey remains largely jovial and optimistic. The only time he displayed any overtly fearful concern for his future was when he talked about how some of the guys he played with who have suffered from brain disorders, some of them friends of his, have died in nursing homes. Needless to say, he dreads the possibility of ending up, he said, “in one of those places.”“That’s not going to happen,” Carlene reassured him, shaking her head sternly. “We’re not going to let that happen.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/soccer/omar-gonzalez-ready-for-success-on-international-stage.html,"CARSON, Calif. — While Omar Gonzalez has spent the early years of his career stockpiling trophies and plaudits, the international part of his résumé has remained largely empty.Predictably, it has become an open space through which soccer fans and pundits have begun to wander.As the United States prepares to embark next week on the final stage of qualifying matches for the 2014 World Cup, Gonzalez’s sparkling play over the past four seasons in Major League Soccer has left many buzzing about whether he can become a welcome stalwart on his country’s back line — if not now, then by the time the World Cup is played in Brazil, assuming the United States makes it that far.It is a discussion Gonzalez embraces.“What everyone is thinking, I’m thinking, too,” he said in a recent interview at a national team training camp in California. “I’m thinking I can be the guy that fills the shoes of the guys that are getting older and reaching the end of their career.”What remains to be determined now is whether such thoughts can become reality. To some degree, it will depend on whether Gonzalez can use the training camp that is now concluding and an exhibition match on Tuesday against Canada to truly begin earning the trust of Jurgen Klinsmann, the national team’s coach.But even amid this uncertainty, the reasons that the 24-year-old Gonzalez is now the subject of so much interest are plain to see. A strapping central defender who stands 6 feet 5 inches, he has the ability to muscle through skirmishes on the ground and dominate the air on both ends of the field.Gonzalez grew up in the Dallas area, helped lead Maryland to the 2008 N.C.A.A. championship and then was selected by the Los Angeles Galaxy in the first round of the 2009 M.L.S. draft. He went on to be named the league’s rookie of the year, was picked for the All-Star team the next two seasons and, in 2011, when he helped the Galaxy win the first of two consecutive titles, was named the league’s top defender.Intrigued, the German club F.C. Nuremberg brought Gonzalez to Europe on a short-term deal last winter. But the biggest opportunity of his career quickly turned into his first significant setback. On Jan. 5, 2012, during his first practice session with the team, Gonzalez tore the anterior cruciate ligament in his left knee.It was a brutal pause in what seemed to be a quickly ascending career.“I thought at the time I was at the top of my game, coming off the defender of the year, winning the championship, and everything was looking great,” Gonzalez said. “But one day, I’m training, trying to work hard, and the next, I’m out for six months.”But six months was still quicker than expected, and with Gonzalez’s help, the Galaxy cleaned up their play halfway through last season and went on to win the championship for the second straight year. Gonzalez, who estimated he was at 90 percent strength when he started in the M.L.S. championship game, nevertheless took over on both sides of the field. He scored a vital equalizing goal in the Galaxy’s 3-1 victory and was named the game’s most valuable player.“On the field, he’s a game-changer,” said A. J. DeLaGarza, a Galaxy teammate. “Everyone saw how he helped us turn our season around.”Klinsmann said last week that he had watched Gonzalez closely in 2011, before his injury, and said that he was not particularly impressed. “I saw a player that needed to learn a lot,” Klinsmann said.But he added that he had noticed distinct changes since Gonzalez’s return, and he speculated that the injury instilled some urgency into Gonzalez’s mind-set. Perhaps, Klinsmann suggested, it taught him not to take his career for granted.“So far in these few weeks now, I read him, I read him in training sessions, his body language, the way he walks up to the training field, the way he walks through the hotel, and I see a very focused and driven Omar Gonzalez, which is for us wonderful to see,” he said.Klinsmann has used the training camp to meet with players individually. In an interview last week, he said his message to Gonzalez would be something along these lines: You’ve still got a long way to go. But because you’re still young, I think if you can reach your potential, and if you become consistent, and if you say, ‘I want to live the life of a professional athlete to the fullest,’ there’s a world waiting for you.Ultimately, Gonzalez’s response to that message will come on the field.He said last week that he tried to downshift this winter after a grueling season. He and his girlfriend went to London, where he watched Arsenal play a match as a guest of the club’s chief executive, Ivan Gazidis. He had a less enjoyable time attending a teammate’s bachelor party in Hawaii, where he stepped on a piece of coral and opened a cut that required five stitches.But now he is healthy, trying to build on his two previous appearances for the national team and trying to justify all the buzz around him.Bruce Arena, the coach of the Galaxy and a former coach of the national team, said it was clear that Gonzalez was good enough to handle the lower levels of international soccer. But, like Klinsmann, he wants to see how much higher Gonzalez can go. He, too, wants to be convinced.“The friendly they’re playing is not anything he can’t deal with,” Arena said of Tuesday’s game against Canada in Houston. “The ultimate is playing in the World Cup, where you’re playing against the best players in the world and for the most coveted prize.”Gonzalez sounded just as curious, but confident, too.“I’m looking forward to seeing what international soccer is like,” he said. “I’m looking for those doors to open for me.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/baseball/dodgers-sweet-tv-deal-will-taste-bitter-to-fans.html,"In Los Angeles, the number of teams remains constant. It’s just the number of regional sports networks that grows.Not long ago, there were two: Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket, also a Fox channel.Now there are six, in large part because of the aggressiveness of Time Warner Cable. In 2011, it lured the Los Angeles Lakers from Fox Sports West to its new English and Spanish language networks at an estimated price of $3 billion over 20 years.On Monday, Time Warner Cable announced what has been expected for a while, saying that in a deal worth up to $8 billion over 25 years, it will carry Dodgers games on the newfangled SportsNet LA starting in 2014 when the team leaves Prime Ticket.Add to that the regional channel created by the Pacific-12 Conference. While all this money being exchanged might be great for the teams, it’s lousy for the fans. With one team, SportsNet LA alone could add up to $5 a month to the costs of cable, satellite and telephone companies. They in turn pass much of those costs onto subscribers. The two Lakers channels charge $4 a month. And the two Fox channels together cost $5.40 a month, according to SNL Kagan.The Dodgers’ deal shows a company simultaneously at work in two roles: Time Warner is the largest cable television operator in Southern California and a regional sports network creator. In its first role, it wants to avoid, if it can, going through a middleman to buy the rights to marquee sports teams. By creating a network to showcase the Dodgers, it can guarantee that all of its subscribers get that network, while also extracting steep subscriber fees from AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Charter, DirecTV and Dish Network.The new Dodgers ownership — playing out the vision of the disgraced former owner, Frank McCourt — will take in a huge amount of cash just for putting a team on the field 162 times a year. Time Warner will pay the team $7 billion to $8 billion over 25 years.But only a portion of that staggering sum, about $84 million a year, which will rise at 4 percent annually, is designated as the team’s market-value rights fee and taxable at a 34 percent rate for Major League Baseball’s revenue-sharing pool.This is quite nice for the Dodgers if baseball upholds it. The remaining billions it will get — from odd sources like branding rights for Time Warner Cable and buying time on the channel for other Time Warner Cable programming — also rises at 4 percent a year. And that would not be subject to revenue sharing. Sweet indeed; a terrific tax shelter.Once they get a hold of the contract, baseball officials will see if what is slated to be untaxed should really be taxed and available to share. If the money is guaranteed, and not at risk, it should be taxed. Guggenheim Partners, the financial services giant that backed last March’s $2.15 billion purchase of the Dodgers, might reluctantly have to share more than it wants.“Throughout, it seems clear that Guggenheim was eager to minimize the bite that revenue sharing would take,” said Lee Berke, a media consultant who specializes in regional sports networks. “It seems a way to thread the needle to achieve a substantial upside. It’s a complex way around revenue sharing.”The Dodgers-Time Warner Cable deal is the culmination of a tense drama inside baseball that began when McCourt, financially struggling and prohibited by Commissioner Bud Selig from extending his deal with Fox, put the team into bankruptcy. (That deal included a $385 million upfront sweetener.) In a process overseen by a federal bankruptcy court judge, McCourt sold the team last March to Guggenheim.Even at his most nakedly desperate, McCourt knew how much more valuable the Dodgers would be as a television product once the team could negotiate on the open market. That opening occurred late last year when Guggenheim let prospective bidders know that it would make a deal only for a regional sports network. All Dodgers all the time. Fox’s offer, evidently not as enticing or willing to hit the tripwires of baseball’s revenue-sharing system, included giving the Dodgers some ownership of Prime Ticket.The vast sums promised to the Dodgers might lead, on one level, to more Dodgers programming that only Tommy Lasorda might be able to tolerate. But that bounty also seems a precursor to higher costs for sports fans in Los Angeles and everywhere else."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/hockey/rangers-are-still-looking-for-scorers.html,"GREENBURGH, N.Y. — What do the Rangers want, and where can they find it? They could answer the first question easily enough ahead of Tuesday’s home game against the Philadelphia Flyers. But the second question baffled them.What the Rangers want is more scoring from their second, third and fourth lines. That was why Saturday they tentatively signed the 38-year-old free-agent forward Jason Arnott, who scored 17 goals last season for the St. Louis Blues. But the deal fell through Sunday when Arnott failed a physical, so it was back to the drawing board for the 2-3 Rangers.Their top line of Marian Gaborik, Brad Richards and Rick Nash has 19 points. The rest of the team has 18.“We can’t just rely on that one line,” Coach John Tortorella said after practice Monday. “If that line struggles, we have no chance. We need to get other people going.”The Gaborik-Richards-Nash line thrived in Saturday’s 5-2 win over Toronto, largely because Tortorella used it as part of a five-man unit with defensemen Michael Del Zotto and Marc Staal.But in the Rangers’ 2-1 loss to the Flyers last Thursday, the top line was, in Tortorella’s words, “an absolute no-show.” After that game Tortorella said the Rangers were not looking for the solution to their scoring problems at their American Hockey League affiliate in Hartford, implying they would explore the thin free-agent market for help.Arnott was the second-leading scorer from last season available as a free agent, but it appears he has not recovered from off-season knee surgery to the Rangers’ satisfaction.“He couldn’t pass a medical, so we’ll move on, that’s all I can tell you,” Rangers General Manager Glen Sather told reporters at practice. He added that “it’s always necessary to look around” and that he would continue to do so.The top-scoring free-agent forward remaining is Petr Sykora, 36, who scored 21 goals for the Devils last season. But he is not considered a good fit for a Tortorella team.The No. 3 scorer is Andrew Brunette, 39, who had 12 goals for the Chicago Blackhawks last season and is a garbage-goal specialist. He is a Tortorella-type grinder, but he said earlier this month he might retire.That leaves the No. 4 free-agent scorer as the most likely target for the Rangers: Daymond Langkow, who scored 11 goals for the Phoenix Coyotes last season. Langkow, 36, is small at 5 feet 10 inches, but he has 672 points in 1,090 career N.H.L. games.There is also a chance the Rangers may stand pat after a promising debut by forward Benn Ferriero. Picked up from Pittsburgh’s A.H.L. affiliate in a trade for the minor leaguer Chad Kolarik on Thursday, Ferriero played 12 minutes 40 seconds against the Maple Leafs and acquitted himself well.“You’re starting with a guy that we just traded for, was in the minors, started on our fourth line, and was our second-line center halfway through the game,” Tortorella said Monday. “He deserved his time — he was very effective, where other players weren’t.”Ferriero, 25, has only 14 goals and 22 points in 93 N.H.L. games. Listed generously at 5-11, he can play all three forward positions and may turn out to be a useful player.“I’m not the biggest, not the strongest, but I can figure out a way to get it done,” said Ferriero, who played alongside Brian Boyle at Boston College and skated on a line with Boyle and Taylor Pyatt at practice Monday.“I guess they brought me here for a reason, and that’s the way I play,” Ferriero said. “When I’m moving my feet is when I’m playing my best — the speed game, moving the puck, some quick attacks.”On Thursday Tortorella said that the Rangers were “looking at a number of players,” not just Arnott. He was asked Monday if that was still true.Tortorella said, “Really, I just said that because I didn’t want to answer your questions.”SLAP SHOTSThe Rangers spent a lot of time Monday practicing their power play, which is only 2 for 22 in the first five games. Brad Richards pointed out that because of the compressed schedule it was only the Rangers’ second full practice since the season started. “This feels more like a March schedule, or the end of the year, when you’re trying to just play games and conserve energy,” he said. “We had to practice some things today that normally we’d have to space out over a couple of days.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/football/super-bowl-jerome-bogers-probable-pick-as-referee-is-questioned.html,"NEW ORLEANS — In many ways, it is fitting. Four months after the N.F.L. began its season with replacement officials — who struggled to complete a coin toss, confused which city a team hailed from and incorrectly identified whether the offense or defense had caught a critical pass in the end zone — another referee controversy is looming as the Super Bowl approaches.That is because, while the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens clearly earned their way to the Super Bowl, questions have been raised about whether the top referee this season will be joining them.The league is expected to announce this week that Jerome Boger, an N.F.L. referee for seven years, will lead the crew of officials here Sunday. Historically, that means Boger scored the highest among referees during the standard postgame evaluations — a notion that some observers and, privately, several other on-field officials find hard to comprehend.“What’s happening right now is that the best officials are not working the best games,” said Jim Daopoulos, who worked 11 years as an on-field official and 12 years as a supervisor of officials before becoming an officiating analyst for NBC. Daopoulos added that he believed that the grading of some officials, including Boger, was altered because the league had a predetermined assignment in mind.“I’m looking at the seven guys who are working in the Super Bowl, and to be quite honest, several of them should not be on the field,” Daopoulos said.Michael Signora, a spokesman for the N.F.L., disputed that, writing in an e-mail, “There is no merit to the suggestion that Jerome Boger’s grades were treated differently from those of any other official.”Signora added, “Claims to the contrary are both inaccurate and unfair.”Still, some elements of the appointment seem strange. Ben Austro, the founder of FootballZebras.com, a Web site that focuses on news and analysis of officials in the N.F.L., first reported the Boger assignment several weeks ago. Austro said in an interview Monday that he was immediately struck by something unusual about the choice, noting that every official is graded by league observers following each game worked, with every call made being deemed correct or incorrect.This season, according to Austro, there were approximately eight instances in which Boger was initially given what officials call a ding, or markdown, for a particular call, only to have those negative grades later overturned. In other words, Austro said, if Boger earned the best grades among referees this season, he did so with the help of significant after-the-fact revisions from those doing the grading.Although it is not clear which grades were changed, Boger did have some unusual moments this season, most notably a sequence in Week 16 when he announced a penalty against Carolina quarterback Cam Newton for “bumping” him while protesting the officiating but did not eject Newton, as the rules require. Boger later said that he misspoke and that the penalty against Newton was only for “disrespectfully addressing” an official.According to Daopoulos, the standard procedure is for one of several league supervisors to first review a game on his own. The supervisors then get together as a group to go over the downgrades detected, and generally, Daopoulos said, “the majority or consensus rules” when it comes to overturning a downgrade.This season, however, Daopoulos — and several officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly — said Carl Johnson, the league’s vice president for officiating, unilaterally overturned a number of Boger’s downgrades.Neither Johnson nor Ray Anderson, the league’s executive vice president for football operations, were made available for comment. But Signora, the spokesman, said, “No downgrade is removed unless there is a consensus among the supervisors and the head of the department.”Regardless, while appealing a grade is not unusual — 14 of 18 referees did so successfully this season, according to Signora — the fact that Boger had eight reversals is odd, according to Gerry Austin, who officiated in three Super Bowls from 1982 to 2008 and is now an ESPN contributor.“Based on my past experience, if you could get two downgrades changed in the course of the year, you’ve done real well,” Austin said.Those circumstances, as well as Boger’s having worked only four previous postseason games — none of them conference championship games — led many to wonder if this was a predetermined assignment, Austro said, primarily because there were other referees who finished the season with fewer than eight markdowns who did not work the playoffs at all. That means Boger’s reversals could have elevated him from an official who might not have received an assignment for any playoff game to one who will instead work the league’s showpiece event.“The officials are not going to complain openly about this; they know they can’t chew out their employers and still work,” said Austro, who communicates frequently with many officials in the league as part of his work on the Web site. “But there is no question people are unhappy.”Daopoulos said he believed the league’s motivation to promote Boger, who is black, was multilayered.“To be honest, this has happened before,” he said. “Grades were adjusted. I know the league is very interested in having diversity in the rank and file, and they’ve done a great job of doing that. And for that reason, they’ve tried to work this thing out so that Jerome could have the Super Bowl.”But there may also be some lingering reaction, Daopoulos said, to the labor dispute that led to the league’s locking out the regular officials for the first three weeks of this season. That dispute ended before Week 4, just days after replacement officials botched the ruling on a last-second touchdown pass in a Seattle-Green Bay Monday night game, but tension remained between some officials and Anderson.Ed Hochuli, a highly regarded and popular referee, was featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated just after the lockout and did not hesitate to highlight the regular officials’ plight. Gene Steratore, another well-respected referee, worked the first game after the lockout ended and tipped his cap several times when fans cheered the officials.“I don’t think the league was happy with those things,” Daopoulos said. “I told Ed as soon as I saw the Sports Illustrated thing, ‘Well, you’re not going to be working the Super Bowl this year.’ And you know what? Neither Hochuli or Steratore worked a game in the playoffs.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/golf/tiger-woods-wins-75th-career-title-8th-at-torrey-pines.html,"SAN DIEGO — There is a shop in the village of La Jolla, Second Act West, where people flock to find vintage clothing. Seven miles away, Tiger Woods rooted around in the past on Monday and dug up his designer game from a few years back, turning Torrey Pines into his second act, west.In winning his PGA Tour season debut for the first time since 2008, Woods was equal parts technician and trick-shot artist. Torrey Pines, the site of 8 of his 75 tour victories, is where Woods’s imagination takes flight, as was made plain down the stretch of his closing 72, which propelled him to a four-stroke victory in the Farmers Insurance Open over the defending champion, Brandt Snedeker (69), and Josh Teater (69). Woods now stands seven victories behind Sam Snead’s record 82.“Does it feel good?” Woods said. “Yes. Does it give me confidence? Absolutely. This is a nice way to start the year.”Woods, who finished at 14-under 274, was ahead by eight strokes with five holes left. On a brisk, windy day marked by snail-like play because of the fog-delayed shotgun finish, Woods lost his concentration and his accuracy off the tee but never his lead, which was four at the conclusion of Sunday afternoon’s third round.“I started to lose my patience out there a little bit with the slow play,” Woods said, “and that’s when I made a few mistakes.”Not that he was worried. “I had an eight-stroke lead,” he said. “So I just needed to stay upright and I was going to be fine.”Woods, 37, has won this tournament seven times. After five of his previous six titles, he has gone on to win at least one major.Does Woods have his aura back? “I won this tournament by four shots, so that’s something I’m proud of,” he said, adding, “I would like to win eight, nine times a year.”It took Woods’s threesome nearly four hours to complete its final 11 holes. Until the wind and the waiting wore him down, Woods’s play harked back to his performance here during his injury-shortened season in 2008, when he won his sixth tournament title with a record eight-stroke victory against Ryuji Imada. Five months later, he won the United States Open on the same course.As was the case in Woods’s glory days, he pulled away from the pack on the par 5s. Snedeker played the par 5s in minus-6. Woods played the same holes in minus-12, which was reason enough for him to smile despite his finish: bogey, double bogey, par, bogey, par.“Pretty much did everything well this week and built myself a nice little cushion,” Woods said. “I had some mistakes at the end, but all my good play before that really allowed me to afford those mistakes.”If there was a single shot Monday that signaled that the Woods of old was back, it was his second on the par-5 ninth.On the tee box, Woods backed off his ball after hearing the click of a camera, a common sound in any Woods gallery but particularly so on this day, when the gates were opened to the nonpaying public.After glaring at the offending photographer, Woods set up again for his shot and blocked the ball with a swing so loose his driver flew out of his hands. “Thank you,” he said in a comment directed at the photographer, who had wisely moved on.“It was not a good time to do that,” Woods said later.He was still steaming as he walked off the tee, muttering an expletive under his breath as he walked toward his ball, which was right of the cart path, in a fenced-off area near a temporary tournament tent.After receiving a free drop, Woods took his 3-iron and hit a 217-yard cut shot that landed on the fairway, 85 yards from the pin. He hit onto the green and two-putted for a par that was routine only in his world.When he arrived at No. 15, a 480-yard par-4, Woods was seven strokes ahead of Snedeker, the leader in the clubhouse. He hit his drive into a hazard to the left to set up a two-putt from 13 feet for a double bogey.Woods hit five fairways in his fourth round after finding 12 of 14 in his second. In his best years, Woods was never the straightest off the tee. His genius was evident in his recovery shots, like the one he hit out of the bunker on the par-3 11th that curled to within inches of the cup.“My short game was back to how I know it can be,” Woods said.He added, “That allowed me to save some pars, save some birdies and move my way up the board.”The resumption of the fourth round at 11:10 a.m. local time prevented any of the tour rookies who did not finish Sunday from taking part in the Monday qualifying for this week’s event, the Waste Management Phoenix Open.Among those affected was Brad Fritsch, who began the fourth round in second place and needed to finish in the top 10 to earn a place in this week’s field. Playing in the group directly ahead of Woods, he got off to a spectacular start, sticking his tee shot at the par-3 eighth while Woods watched from a few feet away.“My heart rate was up a little bit on that shot,” said Fritsch, who joked that he appreciated the large gallery, including Woods, turning out to watch him hit.Fritsch missed the birdie putt but squeezed into the next tournament with a 75 that left him in a tie for ninth, seven strokes behind Woods, who, like Fritsch, left the grounds excited about the rest of the year."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/for-new-orleans-bowl-is-a-happy-return-leading-off.html,"Let us be the first to welcome you officially to Super Bowl week, the annual gathering of N.F.L. worship that invades our planet and this year is destined to fill the streets of New Orleans with overindulged people imitating Ray Lewis’s celebration dance. There is nothing that can be done about this. We have already called Super Bowl week customer service. They said we just had to deal with it.Which is why New Orleans is the perfect Super Bowl host: crazy set up shop here long ago and called it home. It’s the overindulgence epicenter, where happy hour flows right past midnight and into breakfast, when you can walk into a voodoo shop and buy a bottle of Love Potion No. 9. A thousand fake Ray Lewises will seem like part of the entertainment.This Super Bowl, though, deserves a moment of more somber reflection. It’s the first one in New Orleans since Katrina nearly drowned it. As Sam Gardner writes on Foxsports.com, in August 2005 the Superdome was not the center of the football universe but a black hole of misery, the hurricane evacuation center that offered no refuge. In those days, the idea that anyone would return here for fun, much less that the Saints would return and call it home or a city would rally around it again was a far-fetched dream. This is why the former N.F.L. commissioner Paul Tagliabue is such a hero here, writes Mike Freeman on CBSSports.com. You do not have to care a whit about football to be cheered that the fun has returned.If you needed a reminder, though, that the on-field part of football is not so much fun and games, we have the story of the former New Orleans folk hero/kicker Tom Dempsey, who, Brett Michael Dykes writes in The Times, is now paying for his reckless style with early dementia. And President Obama rings in Super Bowl week with an interview in The New Republic that includes his prediction that football will have to change to reduce its violent impact on players.But yes, there are plenty of nonsobering stories if you’d prefer to get lost in the fantasy part of the Baltimore Ravens’ playing the San Francisco 49ers for the sport’s biggest prize. The 49ers arrived on the scene on Sunday, seemingly armed against the craziness of the week, Tim Kawakami writes in The San Jose Mercury News, and the Ravens follow them into town on Monday, with running back Ray Rice trying to bark his way back into the spotlight, Les Carpenter writes on Yahoo.com. Most of the noise will come from the invading army of television media, as Richard Deitsch writes on SI.com, all trying to talk over one another. By the end of the week you will be regaled with every possible story line. Don Banks of SI.com tries to help you get a jump on them, including the terrific tidbit that Ray Lewis’s first sack came at the expense of one Jim Harbaugh.There were actual sporting events played over the weekend, too, even a football game of sorts, although the Pro Bowl hardly seems to qualify. It did, however, feature a nice moment in the one last snap shared by Peyton Manning and his longtime center Jeff Saturday — which required Saturday to switch teams for one play.This was more watchable than tennis’s first major of the year only because it happened during normal viewing hours. The Australian Open men’s final was far more mesmerizing, but it happened in the middle of the night. So for the third straight year you missed Novak Djokovic winning it all and making people wonder who on earth is going to stop him, writes Jon Wertheim on SI.com. Andy Murray came respectably close, showing just how far he has come in lodging himself among the best in the game, Paul Hayward writes in The Telegraph, but he has the misfortune of meeting Djokovic at his very best, James Lawton writes in The Independent.The N.B.A. lost one of its key characters for the season over the weekend when doctors declared Celtics point guard Rajon Rondo out for the season with a torn anterior cruciate ligament. That certainly stifled the celebration of the Celtics' double-overtime win over the Heat on Sunday, writes Ian Thomsen on SI.com, and made it feel an awful lot like the Celtics’ last stand, Adrian Wojnarowski writes on Yahoo.com. Because despite all of the Celtics’ protests to the contrary, they are toast without Rondo, writes Steve Bulpett in The Boston Herald.Which means fans in New England might as well tune in for Super Bowl week, even without their beloved Patriots in it.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/football/super-bowl-for-ravens-a-game-away-from-the-game.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Before the Baltimore Ravens left for New Orleans on Monday, they packed up all of their equipment and gear. With a long week ahead of them before the Super Bowl on Sunday, players and staff went to great lengths to include everything they considered most important, everything vital to their performance.So it was a given that their four cornhole boards, which occupied a central piece of real estate in the locker room at their training facility this season, were coming with them.“I think it’s fair to say that it’s been a secret to our success,” said Morgan Cox, the team’s long snapper.Cornhole, a Midwestern pastime also known in some parts of the country as Bags, is a game of stupefying simplicity. Points are scored by tossing a small bag, typically filled with resin, into a round hole cut into a slanted board.The Ravens take the game seriously. They played games before practice and after meetings, the soft thud of the cornhole sack providing a sense of stability — and community — in a roller-coaster season. It was a foregone conclusion that the boards would make the trip to Louisiana.In fact, quarterback Joe Flacco and punter Sam Koch are members of the American Cornhole Organization, the sport’s governing body. Frank Geers, the A.C.O.’s president and chief executive, said Koch called him late last week to stock up on additional supplies — and Koch even saved about $10 by using his membership discount.The Ravens have bonded over cornhole, Koch said. An N.F.L. locker room can be an isolating place, with offensive and defensive players seldom interacting. Why would a starting defensive end strike up a conversation with the third-string quarterback? But inside the Ravens’ locker room, cornhole has been a unifying force — like a Monday night bowling league.“When you pick up a bag and start playing, you have an instant reason to talk to guys and build relationships,” Koch said.Based on the Ravens’ cornhole rankings (yes, there is such a thing), Koch is the team’s top player. The only person who consistently challenges Koch is Darren Sanders, the Ravens’ director of security. Offensive lineman Michael Oher used to give Koch problems, but teammates say Oher’s confidence and technique have waned in recent months. It has not gone unnoticed.“Mike isn’t even in the top five anymore,” Cox said. “He’s really declined.”The Ravens began to play cornhole in 2010, when defensive end Cory Redding introduced the team to the game’s finer points. (Redding, who now plays for the Indianapolis Colts, is also a member of the A.C.O.) It did not take long for cornhole to catch on. The players found that it was an easy way to unwind after practices and pass the time between meetings.The Ravens usually organize several tournaments over the course of the season, with singles and doubles brackets. Flacco and Oher’s team is called the Untouchables.The Ravens even set up a special Twitter account for cornhole-specific updates (@RavensCornhole), though posts this season have been few and far between. The team, by most accounts, has been more concerned with winning games than tabulating rankings.The Ravens’ specialists hold the most cornhole clout. Cox, the long snapper, explained how kickers and punters needed to be precise with their movements — a valid theory, to be sure. “But it could also just be the fact that we have a lot of time on our hands,” he said.Justin Tucker, the team’s rookie kicker, said he benefited from some informal cornhole training before he entered the N.F.L. Once he joined the Ravens, he worked hard to refine his self-described “herky-jerky” throwing motion.Like Oher, Tucker has seen his cornhole aptitude deteriorate during the playoffs. Nailing a winning a 47-yard field goal against the Denver Broncos in the divisional round earlier this month provided some solace, if only temporarily.“I used to be top five around here,” Tucker said. “But I’ve fallen off. It’s a shame.”Koch, who grew up in Nebraska and has been with the Ravens since 2006, said he never played cornhole until it made its locker-room debut three years ago. He realizes this might come as a surprise. “Coming from Nebraska, and it being the Cornhusker State, you automatically think cornhole,” he said.Regardless, Koch said it took him only about four or five weeks to develop a technique that suited him. He now feels most comfortable tossing the bag like a Frisbee, with a slight clockwise rotation. Consistency is what sets him apart. He is the Stan Musial of the cornhole toss, at least in N.F.L. circles.“Sam took it to another level,” Cox said. “He raised the bar for everybody else.”Koch would have a tougher time on the professional cornhole circuit, at least according to Geers, who created the A.C.O. with the goal of spreading the game. The country’s best players are capable of earning up to $10,000 a year. The world champion is recognized as the King of Cornhole.“After the Super Bowl, I’d love to have some of these guys on the front line against our top players in the country,” Geers said. “I bet they’d be floored.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/football/nfl-football-roundup.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco, one of the quietest and most polite players in the middle of two boisterous franchises in New Orleans for Super Bowl XLVII, made some waves Monday night when he was quoted as being critical of the decision to hold the Super Bowl at MetLife Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., next year.Flacco, a New Jersey native, used an offensive term to describe the idea.“I think it’s retarded,” Flacco was reported to have said. “I probably shouldn’t say that. I think it’s stupid. If you want a Super Bowl, put a retractable dome on your stadium. Then you can get one.”Asked to clarify his remarks during media day, Flacco expressed regret for using the term, but did not back down from his belief that the game should not be held in a cold-weather city unless the stadium has a roof.“They’ve done it the way they’ve been doing it for 47 years,” Flacco said. “There’s a lot that goes into this game, more than just playing the game: it’s about the fans and it’s about the players that played for the right to get there. There are a lot of things that go into it and it’s just kind of a crazy decision, I believe.”With average daytime highs in February of about 40 degrees, the Super Bowl in New Jersey will have a chance of breaking the record low for the game, set in New Orleans in 1972, with a temperature at kickoff of 39 degrees.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/hockey/rangers-beat-flyers-and-move-to-500-on-the-season.html,"It was not pretty, as Michael Del Zotto attested after he scored one goal and set up another in the Rangers’ 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. But, as he added, the Rangers found a way to win.Finding a way to win was something the Rangers “did a great job of last year,” Del Zotto said. True. It was also true that this one was not pretty.The Rangers barely escaped with the win and lost their captain, Ryan Callahan, with an undisclosed injury to his left arm or shoulder. They also took “way too many penalties,” as Coach John Tortorella put it, giving up six power plays but killing five.Tortorella seemed more concerned with the excessive penalties than with how the Rangers killed them off. “I focus on the dumbness of Hagelin,” Tortorella said, adding that while he played a great game, it was “washed out by dumbness.”The reference was to forward Carl Hagelin, who led the Rangers with four shots on goal but who also caused a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty in the third period.The victory lifted the Rangers to 3-3 and put them at .500 for the first time this season. It also avenged a listless 2-1 loss in Philadelphia last Thursday.But it could come at a cost. Callahan missed the last 15 minutes of the game. He skated off the ice clutching his left arm after wrestling with the Flyers’ Max Talbot in a pointless post-whistle scrum, for which both players received roughing penalties.Earlier, Callahan scored a goal for his 200th career point.Del Zotto was superb over the game’s first 40 minutes. He scored in the first, his second goal in two games, added an assist on Callahan’s goal and continued his emergence as the Rangers’ best attacking defenseman.“There’s no question Michael’s biggest asset is joining the rush,” Tortorella said before the game. “He’s tending to stand still a little bit with the puck — we want him moving with the puck also. But he’s had a good start. He’s still just a very young kid in this game.”Del Zotto did not stand still much Tuesday. He shrugged off a tremendous body check from Zac Rinaldo and calmly skated away with the puck, drew a key penalty, ran smooth breakouts from the Rangers’ end and jumped into the attack consistently.Del Zotto opened the scoring 1 minute 57 seconds into the game. Philadelphia defenseman Andreas Lilja practically handed the puck to Benn Ferriero in the Flyers’ end. Ferriero passed it back to Del Zotto, whose slap shot from 57 feet, low and along the ice, beat Flyers goalie Ilya Bryzgalov to the near post.“It’s not like the shot was a bomb or anything,” Del Zotto said. “It was a seeing-eye shot — nice when they go in.”It was Del Zotto’s second goal of the season. He was belatedly credited with the Rangers’ fourth goal in the 5-2 victory against Toronto on Saturday night, a goal originally credited to Brian Boyle.It was also Ferriero’s first point as a Ranger, in only his second game with the club.At 11:31 of the second period, Del Zotto assisted on Callahan’s goal, a rare man-advantage strike for the Rangers. Their power play, which started the game at 2 for 22, is now at 3 for 24.Del Zotto was the Ranger who created the power play when he was tripped by Talbot at 11:02.But the Flyers drew to within 2-1 on a power-play goal from Kimmo Timonen at 7:09 of the third period, after the Rangers were caught with too many men on the ice because of Hagelin’s gaffe.Over all, though, the Rangers’ penalty killers played well. That included killing off 1:17 of a two-man advantage in the second period. Despite never clearing their zone once during that stretch, the three penalty killers — Ryan McDonagh, Dan Girardi and Jeff Halpern — allowed only two shots on goalie Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped 26 in all.“I’m getting more and more comfortable,” said Lundqvist, who boosted his season save percentage to .905 from .893. “I’m getting there.”With Callahan gone for the final 15 minutes, the Rangers hung in and staved off the Flyers, whose record fell to 2-5.“A guy like Cally does everything so well, especially blocking shots, and leads by example,” Del Zotto said. “The guys did a good job of gathering themselves after he went off with that injury.”The Rangers’ shutdown defensemen shone in the third period. Girardi played almost 11 minutes. McDonagh played almost 12 and led all players with 30:09 for the game.It was enough to save the win for the Rangers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/football/super-bowl-ravens-center-addresses-concussion-issue.html,"NEW ORLEANS — For nearly 15 seasons, for more than 200 games, Matt Birk has blocked and mauled and protected. He has anchored offensive lines, both in Minnesota and in Baltimore, which meant he has suffered through various neck, elbow and knee injuries. He has made six Pro Bowls. He has opened holes for Adrian Peterson and Ray Rice.Last off-season, Birk had surgery for varicose veins, a procedure that only provided more old-guy fodder for his teammates. None would have blamed Birk if he decided to retire as one of the elite offensive linemen of his generation.Instead, he returned for another season, perhaps longer, because of the Ravens and their roster and the chance to accomplish the one feat that has long eluded him. He returned in the hope he would play in his first Super Bowl, and he will, on Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers, this close to his first championship in a career that began in 1998.“I didn’t think I was going to be here,” Birk said Tuesday of his mind-set when his career started.Only Birk, long among the most outspoken pro football players, the Harvard graduate turned All-Pro center, did more than simply return for another season. He played, Coach John Harbaugh said, better than he had at any point since he arrived in Baltimore from Minnesota in 2009. Smart, Harbaugh called his center. Tough.This was most evident in the A.F.C. title game against New England. A year earlier, Birk had struggled against the Patriots’ Vince Wilfork, but he handled Wilfork this time around. Wilfork assisted on one tackle as Birk’s dream run continued.“He’s had the kind of career we are all chasing,” teammate Marshal Yanda said. “He was healthier this year. He still plays at a high level.”Still, as much as Birk loves football, he is also aware of the narrative shift in regard to concussions, of the toll and damage that repeated hits take on veterans who have endured a similar number of collisions.Birk said his friends tell him how lucky he is. They say he should never retire, that the damage to his body is “already done,” that the real world is overrated.“You realize how lucky you are,” Birk said. “You realize it won’t last forever.”To that end, Birk, 36, spent much of media day on Tuesday talking about head injuries and brain donations and President Obama’s recent comments about the dangerous nature of football. Birk talked about how he has worked with companies to help develop a device that measures the impact of collisions. He talked about his responsibility to future players, to children, to the game.Birk said the device would provide instant feedback on the impact of hits that are not as evident as a broken bone or a twisted knee.“The culture has definitely changed,” he said. “Way back when you didn’t really talk about it, and it wasn’t really considered, in a lot of ways, a real injury by players because that was just the talk in the locker room. You just played through it. You did everything you could to play through it.”In many ways, Birk seemed indicative of the so-called concussion crisis in the N.F.L. He has spent 15 years in the N.F.L., has sustained his share of collisions, has had operations (even missed all of 2005 because of injuries) and yet has come back for more. He acknowledged the risk inherent in that decision, and said that Obama had made a fair point.Yet while Birk said he would donate his brain for research, he also said he would let his children play football. He hoped the game would be safer then, in part because of the actions he has taken now.“Certainly, it is a dangerous game,” Birk said. “We’re finding out more and more, every day, the long-term effects that this game can have. It’s a joint effort to make this game as safe as it can be. Whatever we can do to make it safer.”Despite his career longevity, Birk is under contract through the 2014 season. That is a long time to play in the N.F.L., let alone on the offensive line.“My story and where I came from, I was just trying to hold on every year,” Birk said. “That’s how I always looked at it. It will come to an end. When it’s over, it’s over.”Well, not before his first Super Bowl at least."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/football/49ers-tramaine-brock-goes-from-naia-to-nfls-biggest-stage.html,"NEW ORLEANS — While Sunday’s Super Bowl will feature two quarterbacks from colleges with relatively unheralded football programs, it would be incorrect to say that either Baltimore’s Joe Flacco, who went to Delaware, or San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick, who played at Nevada-Reno, have the most modest college pedigree in the game.That honor belongs instead to 49ers defensive back Tramaine Brock, a third-year player out of tiny Belhaven University in Jackson, Miss. He gave a long laugh Tuesday when asked if he thought any other player might have a similarly small-time background.“I don’t know for sure if anyone here went to a smaller school than me,” Brock finally said. “But I doubt it.”Belhaven, which was known as the Belhaven College for Young Ladies when it was chartered in 1894, is a liberal arts school with about 2,600 on-campus students. It is best known for its Christian foundation, its commitment to the performing arts and, at least to some, its proximity to the International Ballet Competition, which is held in Jackson every fourth year.Certainly it is not known for its athletes. Brock is the first student from Belhaven to play in the N.F.L., an honor which is hardly surprising when one considers that Belhaven is not even a member of the N.C.A.A.; it competes as part of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (N.A.I.A.), which mostly comprises smaller colleges with modest sports budgets.“It’s small-college football,” said Joe Thrasher, the coach of Belhaven’s football team. “You have to love it. You have to have a passion for it. And you have to be able to stretch your dollars.”So how small is small? Thrasher said the Blazers’ football team shares its stadium, H. T. Newell Field, with the local public high schools, as well as with several other Belhaven sports teams. That can make practice timing difficult — “when our time is up, some days we’ll have to make way for the soccer team or one of the high schools,” he said.It also requires the players to make what is known as the Blazer Walk. “We would get dressed for games on campus in our locker room and then walk a little ways down to the stadium for the game,” Brock said. “It was a little weird but it was cool.”Of course, if the Blazers want to practice on campus they can do so, but they will have to use a field that is roughly 20 to 30 yards shorter than regulation and, in Brock’s words, “sort of like a big backyard.” There was no dedicated film room for players to watch tape of their opponents when Brock was there, so Thrasher and the other coaches would set up projectors in campus classrooms for football study sessions.All of it was an adjustment for Brock, who went to Belhaven in 2009 after a stint at Mississippi Gulf Coast Community College and one season at Minnesota, where he finished third on the team in tackles but was suspended for failing to qualify academically and did not return.Leaving Minnesota was difficult, Brock said, because he felt the university “didn’t support me trying to work my way back.” Still, he held on to his goal of playing in the N.F.L. and quickly focused on Belhaven because a few of his teammates from Gulf Coast had ended up there. It was also attractive because he grew up in Gulfport, Miss., which is about 150 miles from Jackson.“I knew it was going to be tougher, but I just wanted to play,” he said. “I thought if I might still be able to get drafted late, like sixth or seventh round. I just had to show people I could play.”He did that, returning two of his six interceptions for touchdowns and recording 51 tackles, including 13 ½ tackles for a loss. Asked for his best memory of that season, Brock said he recalled returning an interception 55 yards for a score with a scout from the Indianapolis Colts in the stands, but admitted that he had no idea which team Belhaven was playing.“I just sort of played,” he said. “I didn’t know our conference or who we played. I just tried to play.”Brock did remember well the lengthy — and sometimes epic — bus trips the Blazers took during their travels in the Mid-South Conference, to colleges such as Cumberland (Tenn.), Faulkner (Ala.) and West Virginia University Institute of Technology.“I remember one that was at least double-digits each way,” Brock said. “At Minnesota, we flew everywhere, even to Wisconsin, and that was like right down the street. But the bus rides weren’t so bad. You just had to have good headphones.”Standing on the Superdome field Tuesday, Brock said he never doubted he would be able to make the N.F.L. from Belhaven. He ultimately was not drafted but signed with the 49ers before the 2010 season. After bouncing back and forth from on the team to released to the practice squad to the active squad, Brock stuck as a reserve on defense and special teams player. He appeared in all 16 games this season.“Everyone here is buzzing about it,” Thrasher said. “Everyone is so proud and it’s a great story. I’ve got some recruits coming in, and if you think I’m not going to tell them about Tramaine, you’re crazy.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/football/super-bowl-there-is-a-harbaugh-sister-too.html,"NEW ORLEANS — When the gossip finally reached the Western Kentucky athletic department — that the daughter of the football coach was dating the young basketball assistant — there was one natural reaction.“I remember laughing to myself thinking, with all the coaches and athletes in Joani’s family, is she sure she wants to get involved with a coach?” said Paul Just, a former Western Kentucky sports information director.“Joani might have had enough.”Apparently not, because Joani Harbaugh, the youngest child of the football coach Jack Harbaugh, and the sister of John and Jim, eventually married Tom Crean, the young basketball assistant she started dating in the early 1990s. He is now the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers, the third-ranked team in the country, and Joani Crean might be the most anxiety-ridden sports fan in the United States this week.“I don’t know how that happened,” she said, laughing, about her fate. “It was not a plan. Twenty years ago, we were all different people. Twenty years ago, we were all scrapping and scraping to make a few bucks.”Those days are long gone, of course, but ever since John Harbaugh’s Baltimore Ravens and Jim Harbaugh’s San Francisco 49ers advanced to the Super Bowl 10 days ago, the Harbaugh family dynamics have been analyzed with a depth usually reserved for a psychiatrist’s sofa.Joani, though, was more worried about basketball. Last week, a few days after her husband had tried to catch a few minutes of the N.F.C. championship game in an airport while his team prepared to leave Chicago after a victory at Northwestern — Crean admitted he would have stood there longer if he had not had 50 people waiting for him — she had a mental checklist for the next few days .“In my mind-set, we have three games before the Super Bowl; my son has a game and he has a science test,” she said last week. “Honestly, I’m more nervous watching Tom’s games. That affects our life every day. That affects my kids going to school every day. I would say Jim and John’s jobs don’t affect my daily life.”The Harbaugh and Crean families are, in many ways, like most others that do not involve powerful figures in tremendously high-profile enterprises. Jackie, Jack Harbaugh’s wife, is the chief executive of the family, Tom Crean said. The three Harbaugh children worry most about seeing their parents, who live in Wisconsin now, and about getting all of their own children together. They do not all get together often enough, they admit, mostly because of the demands of their jobs. When they do, Joani said, “it’s no different than any other family. Diapers need to be changed, babies need to be fed.”Well, not exactly. Other families don’t usually coordinate visits around the N.F.L. scouting combine, the way the Harbaugh brothers do when they are in Indianapolis in February. Crean said the last time he could remember the entire family being together was last year during Super Bowl week. The Hoosiers had just lost on a Wednesday night, and at their practice Thursday, Jim and John showed up and addressed the team.“It was really them talking to our team like they talk to their own teams,” Crean said. “ ‘This is what you need to do to win.’ It was all about attitude.”Crean said it was the jolt the Hoosiers needed to propel them through the rest of the season and into the N.C.A.A. tournament. But the communication among the brothers-in-law goes much deeper. Crean said he receives text messages from the Harbaugh brothers before or after almost every Indiana game asking about the Hoosiers. Crean follows their teams closely, too, reading as much as he can about them. He watches their games live or on tape, in part because he tries to glean things from the way the Ravens and the 49ers play and apply them to the Hoosiers. Crean said that even if those teams were not coached by his wife’s brothers, he would have a file of the things they do because the Harbaughs are excellent coaches.“Some techniques with how you use screens, with using hands and leverage, attacking shoulders, definitely some drill ideas I get from them,” Crean said. “When you talk about leverage and staying low, no question about it, to me those things parallel. The discipline of practice, the structure of practice. I learned a lot when John was in Philadelphia on grading of film; I learned more and more from Jim about how long to be in front of your team. Those are ongoing discussions. I am very, very fortunate in this deal to have them as friends, and certainly as resources.”He also has Joani, who Crean said takes his games hard and who, he added, is at least as competitive as her legendarily competitive brothers. That is a trait she may have picked up from her mother.No referee is “without a bull’s-eye on their back when Jackie is watching the game,” Crean said.Last year, before the brothers’ teams played in a Thanksgiving night game, John lamented the favored-child status Joani held as a child. She was spoiled by their parents, John said. She had her own room. She hogged the back seat of the car, pushing the brothers to squeeze in next to the doors.“I was a munchkin in ‘The Wizard of Oz,’ ” Joani said on a conference call last week. “I was highly, highly offended. I do remember that I was not Dorothy or Glinda, so I decided to memorize the entire play. In case anybody went down with the flu or something, they could put me in there. So I was just ready, ready to go.”Crean said his wife, like her brothers, could have been a C.E.O., or maybe an industrial psychologist. And then he offered a description that made her sound very much as if she could be working in the N.F.L.“She’s opinionated, very smart and she doesn’t like to be wrong; she rarely is,” Crean said. “She’ll race our kids in the pool and she’s not letting our two oldest beat her in anything. She wants to win. Joani is not going to lose an argument. To grow up in that house, you had to be competitive.”Maybe that is why, when Joani was asked who really runs the family, she paused.“My mom is the head of the family,” she said. “But I have control issues, unfortunately, so I would probably try to do it. It’s all good.”Except, perhaps, for this week, when Joani would probably like to have more control over what her husband imagines will be the “anguish” her parents will feel watching the Super Bowl. When the Ravens and the 49ers played on Thanksgiving last season, the Harbaugh family watched the game hidden away in an unused office in the Ravens’ stadium, and Joani said she was emotionless. But Crean said his wife has been emotional since the Super Bowl matchup was set, because now she has two brothers at the pinnacle of their profession.The Crean family will travel to New Orleans on Sunday. But first there is the matter of Wednesday’s game at Purdue and Saturday’s prime-time matchup with No. 1 Michigan at home. Crean did not look at his team’s schedule — and how it matched up with the Super Bowl — until after the N.F.L.’s divisional round games. Joani has made sure her brothers have set aside tickets for her family, but other than a few interviews, the run-up to the Super Bowl for her has been mostly about the Indiana basketball games that are at once more difficult for her to watch, but much easier for the rest of her family to determine their rooting interest.But even in the basketball mecca of Bloomington, Ind., where the fate of Crean’s team is of far more interest than the outcome of this Super Bowl, the brothers she used to shove around at home are never far away.“I get, ‘Which brother are you rooting for?’ ” Joani said. “I’m sure it’s a joke. I’m neutral. I’m Switzerland.”That might be the closest to peace that the Creans get this week."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/football/super-bowl-at-media-day-spotlight-on-head-injuries-grows.html,"NEW ORLEANS — It has become a staple of Super Bowl week, as much a part of the pregame to the N.F.L.’s biggest event as the annual media day: a discussion of how football is being affected by head injuries and the mounting evidence that long-term brain damage can be linked to injuries sustained on the field.Years ago, players rarely spoke about the issue and league officials dismissed suggestions that on-field injuries could lead to life-altering health problems. Now, however, the league is facing lawsuits from thousands of former players, rules are being instituted in an attempt to diminish injuries on the field and even President Obama has said that the way football is played will have to change. This week, Bernard Pollard, a hard-hitting safety for the Baltimore Ravens, created a stir by saying that the N.F.L. would not exist in 30 years because of the rules changes designed with safety in mind, but that he also believed there would be a death on the field at some point.At media day Tuesday, players reacted to the comments made by Pollard and Obama, with some agreeing with Pollard that recent rules changes would change the sport to such an extent that it would be less entertaining and lead to a loss of popularity. Pollard stood by his comments. He added, however, that while he was comfortable with the physical risk he was taking by playing football, he was not sure he would want future generations, including his 4-year-old son, to follow his example.“My whole stance right now is that I don’t want him to play football,” Pollard said. “Football has been good to me. It has been my outlet. God has blessed me with a tremendous talent to be able to play this game. But we want our kids to have things better than us.”He said he did not want his son to go through the aches and pains caused by the physicality of the game.“You keep playing football, you’re going to have your injuries, no one is exempt from that,” he said. “You’re going to have concussions. You’re going to have broken bones. That’s going to happen. But I think for the most part, we know what we signed up for.”The sentiment was echoed by Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco. “I play the game and I understand that I’m going to get hit,” Flacco said. “Just because they fine the guys is not going to stop them from hitting me. I find it tough to fine people who are doing their job.”In a recent interview with The New Republic, Obama expressed concern about on-field injuries, though he added that N.F.L. players were grown men who are “well-compensated for the violence they do to their bodies.”The president added: “I think that those of us who love the sport are going to have to wrestle with the fact that it will probably change gradually to try to reduce some of the violence. In some cases, that may make it a little bit less exciting, but it will be a whole lot better for the players, and those of us who are fans maybe won’t have to examine our consciences quite as much.”While many current players seem focused on rules changes and how they will affect the nature of the game, more than 4,000 former N.F.L. players have filed a lawsuit against the league, contending that it knew hits to the head could lead to long-term brain damage but did not share that information with players. The judge in the case said Tuesday that she would hear oral arguments April 9 regarding the league’s motion to dismiss the lawsuit. The family of Junior Seau, a former star linebacker who shot and killed himself last year, has also sued the N.F.L., claiming it failed to inform players about the risks of brain injury.Pollard’s counterparts on the San Francisco 49ers, safeties Dashon Goldson and Donte Whitner, considered one of the hardest-hitting tandems in the N.F.L., thought the key was not removing big hits, but making sure the hits that are delivered are legal.“You can be vicious and you can hit people hard, but do it the right way,” Whitner said. “For the most part, you know what you can and cannot do. Do you want to go out there and do the right things or do you want to make that big hit to gain a big name? That’s what it comes down to.”Ravens guard Marshal Yanda said he thought the topic was so personal for Pollard because of the unique nature of being a hard-hitting defensive back, one of the positions most affected by the league’s attempts to increase player safety.“I think Bernard is frustrated because he plays a tough position where it’s a bang-bang play and he’s getting fined,” Yanda said. “That’s a tough deal as far as him playing football his whole life knowing how to play one way and then all of a sudden you have to change.”One of the few people to disagree entirely with Pollard’s view that skewing the rules to protect offensive players would harm the league was Warren Sapp, a retired defensive tackle who at one point went by the Twitter handle @QBKilla. He said a desire for points would always result in defenses being limited.“They like points,” Sapp said. “I like it too. You’re going to have to make some key stops here and there but it’s an offensive game, no doubt about it.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/football/alex-smith-no-longer-the-starter-still-a-49ers-quarterback.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Alex Smith put on the headphones and then did what he has done for the past two months with the San Francisco 49ers — he waited without complaint. A minute passed. Then two. Then three. The imminent radio interview was not so imminent anymore. The producer apologized. Smith smiled.Reporters encircled him. The crowd swelled. Smith smiled some more. He knew this was coming — not the delay, naturally, but the crush of news media attention at the Super Bowl, where the backup quarterback is often a fun story, a cute story, and not an avatar of empathy and class.Smith, in the middle of his best N.F.L. season, lost his starting job in November. He was sidelined with a concussion, then demoted in favor of the strong-armed dynamo Colin Kaepernick, creating a situation that, offensive lineman Alex Boone said, “could have gone sideways in a hurry.”It did not. Defusing awkward and uncomfortable situations is a Smith specialty. Eight tumultuous seasons as the 49ers’ on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again, on-again, off-again franchise quarterback steeled him. However stung, he never pouted or griped. He tutored Kaepernick. He encouraged him. He endured.“Tough at times, for sure,” Smith said. “Tough to accept. Tough to watch. But we’re in the Super Bowl, and this has been an amazing experience.”All around him at the Superdome on Tuesday, teammates answered questions about tattoos and Twitter, gumbo and God. Some even focused on football. For more than an hour, Smith expressed how it felt to lose his job. He will do it again Wednesday, and then on Thursday before resuming preparations for the biggest game of his career — which he will watch from the sideline.About that: Smith says he is not bitter. He realizes his good fortune. People around the country are laid off every day, lapsing into straits far more dire than Smith’s. He has earned millions of dollars in his career. “I’m still employed,” Smith said.But listen closely, and subtle cues hint at disappointment. Asked how much time elapsed before his frustration subsided, Smith started to speak, stopped, then said: “Things happen in sports. It’s the deal.” Asked if he had envisioned how different this experience would be if he were starting, Smith said, “Honestly, I mean ... ” Long pause. He continued, “I’m not thinking about it, to be totally honest with you.”Smith’s torn emotions are natural, almost expected. Just ask Brett Elliott, who empathizes with Smith, perhaps as few can. In 2003, as the starting quarterback at Utah, Elliott broke his wrist while diving on a 2-point conversion attempt against Texas A&M. In came Smith. Elliott never played another down for the Utes, transferring to Linfield College, a Division III program in his native Oregon.“On a smaller scale, I know exactly how he feels — or, I think I know,” Elliott, now a graduate assistant at Mississippi State, said in a telephone interview last week. “He’s absolutely bummed out that he’s not playing. He has so much invested in the team and the organization. He was fighting tooth and nail for them. He was in that unique place that you rarely get to.”A year ago, the 49ers came within an overtime field goal of advancing to the Super Bowl. Three months ago, Smith led the N.F.L. in passer rating, propped by a career-best completion percentage, and felt, he said, “the most comfortable I’ve been on a football field in a long time, maybe ever.” He completed 18 of 19 passes for 232 yards in a victory at Arizona on Oct. 29, his last game before sustaining that concussion Nov. 11 against St. Louis. In came Kaepernick, who is 7-2 as a starter.All Smith did was follow the N.F.L. protocol for head injuries, at a time when the league is striving to create more awareness about concussions. He said that from the outset he understood the consequences of his injury — “I fully knew what Colin was potentially capable of,” he said — but that he never regretted disclosing his head injury.“There’s no brain transplants that I’ve ever heard of,” Smith said. “We only get one, and it’s not something to mess around with.”Brian Johnson, a close friend of Smith’s, said they discussed the issue a few times over the past few months, and that Smith has never felt he made a wrong decision. Costly, yes. But not wrong.“He sees the big picture,” said Johnson, the offensive coordinator at Utah. “He knows that football lasts so long. He’s sensitive to that. Often times, people say, ‘Play like it’s going to be your last day because you never know when your last play will be.’ And, I think, Alex realizes that is a very, very true statement.”Johnson was in the stands at Candlestick Park on Dec. 30, for the 49ers’ season finale, against Arizona, when Smith replaced Kaepernick with about six minutes remaining. The crowd chanted his name. He completed his only pass, and when the game ended it was as if his career in San Francisco had, too: the seven offensive coordinators, the coach who called him too soft, the rampant turnover on the offensive line, the struggles, the skepticism, his rise and his fall and his resurrection and, now, this.“When we decided to draft Alex with the first pick, we knew we needed a mentally tough guy because we were going to go through some rough times,” said Jim Hostler, Baltimore receivers coach, who was Smith’s quarterback coach in 2005-6 and the 49ers’ offensive coordinator in 2007. “I think he’s shown that every step of the way.”Where that journey takes Smith next is unclear. Just as Elliott left Utah because, he said, “I’m no dummy, I’m a realist,” Smith, 28, will depart San Francisco to start elsewhere. “I don’t feel like this is my last opportunity,” Smith said.In the meantime, he will continue tutoring Kaepernick, for a few more days at least — in the film room, in the quarterbacks room, on the sideline. “He’s almost an interpreter for him in meetings,” said Greg Roman, the 49ers’ offensive coordinator, who added of Smith, “He understands football is a team sport, whereas the entire world, it seems, tries to make it a sport of individuals.”When Roman finished his response, about two minutes of access remained. A horde engulfed Smith across the field. As his teammates dispersed, he lingered a bit longer, answering questions that had been asked 10 times over. A 49ers employee tapped him on the shoulder. It was time for the team picture. He ran over and joined his teammates. He sat in the front row. He was smiling."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/in-discussion-of-sports-violence-players-keep-quiet-leading-off.html,"The players who have gathered in New Orleans for the Super Bowl took an array of talents with them — passing, running, chasing down quarterbacks — but little did they know that their most useful talent in the week leading up to the big game would be tightrope walking. Denial has come in handy, too. Head-faking the big issue in the room? Invaluable.Because this is what was employed in spades on Monday, when the 49ers and the Ravens were greeted with those unhappy questions about the safety of their game, the cloudy futures that await them when their careers end and their bodies keep paying the price. This is the last place they wanted to deal with that, of course, in the days before their big football fantasy comes true. So what else were they going to say in response to President Obama’s conscience-mining thoughts about the violence of the game? Is this when they are going to open their eyes to the ghosts and shadows gathering around them, when they start trying to connect the dots between Junior Seau and Dave Duerson and Jovan Belcher and Tom Dempsey and Bernie Kosar and all the casualties and sufferers?In a word, no.No, unless you’re Ed Reed — the lonely player to admit that he shared Obama’s doubts — you stay on that tightrope between hearing about the dangers of your sport and pretending they are not there. This is the little wire on which the N.F.L. is teetering, as Ashley Fox writes on ESPN.com, which is maddening when the deaths and misery pile up, as Jen Floyd Engel writes on Foxsports.com, but all in the business of perpetuating the N.F.L. Scott Ostler of The San Francisco Chronicle explains that this is how the players function, how fans and sportswriters manage to accept it as collateral damage of a game they love too much. So they crack jokes the way Jim Harbaugh did, or predict everyone would hate watching an N.F.L. that treated players’ heads like something valuable, as Bernard Pollard did. They cling to the tightrope.Isn’t it so much easier to wax poetic about Ray Lewis, which was the rage of the day? Lewis, the Ravens’ retiring superstar, is, after all, possibly strong enough to hold all the gloom at bay. There was Yahoo.com’s Eric Adelson writing about his humble beginnings and the ailing grandmother who made it all possible. Gregg Doyel of CBSSports.com details how many players in the league can trace their success to Lewis’s influence. Mike Preston of The Baltimore Sun even bemoans what a focal point Lewis always is in Baltimore, while Alex Marvez of Foxsports.com describes how polarizing he is everywhere else.Oh sure, there were other potential distractions on Monday, too. You could have gotten lost in the utter emptiness of the news conference starring San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who seems to have mastered the art of saying nothing people will find interesting or controversial, Dan Wetzel writes on Yahoo.com. Or you could have mined the deep pool of silly Super Bowl prop bets. (Hint: pick the over on how many times the name Harbaugh is uttered during the game.)You could even let your mind wander beyond football to stay in a complete fantasy world. In San Diego for example, people were busy imagining the Tiger Woods of old had come back to rule golf after he won at Torrey Pines for the first time in five years, as Farrell Evans writes on ESPN.com. But while the debate still rages whether this is possible, Alan Bastable of Golf.com describes Woods’s final round as showing equal parts dominance and vulnerability. But that does not mean the myth machine will not try to crank itself back up before the Masters.The Miami Heat were in a different kind of fantasy world altogether, enjoying their White House visit to celebrate last season’s championship, but at least that fantasy world had a little-boy glee to it.Hockey kept working out the kinks on its new season, with the news that Montreal defenseman P.K. Subban ended his holdout and signed for a bargain price, writes Allen Muir on SI.com. And Dallas goalie Kari Lehtonen entered an early candidate in the save-of-the-year contest.There was another save of the year going on in Milwaukee, where Bradley Center workers used all kinds of sleights of hand — and loud music — to save themselves further torment by shooing the bat that had taken up residence in the arena rafters. The bat had made quite a spectacle of itself in Marquette’s last home game.Perhaps now the bat should head to New Orleans. They are in need of as many distractions there as possible.Follow Leading Off on Twitter: twitter.com/zinsernyt"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/sports/golf/an-admission-by-singh-an-opportunity-for-the-pga-tour.html,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.At a time when Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy and Phil Mickelson are among the most revered and highly compensated athletes in the world, it’s easy to forget that professional golf was once considered the province of rogues and ruffians, its reputation shadowy enough that in the late 1950s Jack Nicklaus seriously considered remaining an amateur.Vijay Singh’s admission to Sports Illustrated that he used deer antler spray, which contains IGF-1, an insulinlike growth factor that is on the PGA Tour’s list of prohibited substances, affords the tour a wide-open window to let in transparency and public accountability. These are the last elements needed in its evolution from a profession of hustlers to a respected world player.Nicklaus helped usher golf into the mainstream with his family-man gravitas and 18 major titles. Along came Seve Ballesteros and Greg Norman, who played major roles in expanding golf on the global stage. Woods’s arrival led to bulked-up tour purses — from an average of $1.47 million in 1996 to $6.20 million last year — and the repositioning of golf as a sport cool enough to attract bona fide athletes.And yet, the sport continues to be controlled by groups like the United States Golf Association, the R&A and the PGA Tour that administer the rules as if operating in a smoke-filled back room.Consider the U.S.G.A. and the R&A, which allowed golfers to use the anchored putting stroke for over four decades without a dissenting word. Then, after three players using the style won majors in the span of two years, they acted to ban it, leaving a trail of confused golfers.Unlike the major professional sports leagues and even the men’s and women’s professional tennis tours, the PGA Tour has steadfastly refused to announce fines or suspensions. Tour officials do not publicly acknowledge discipline meted out for acts like throwing a club into the gallery, blowing off a mandatory players meeting, getting into an on-course altercation with another player or walking off the course without finishing a round.Their reasoning is that in the vast majority of cases few people know about the original transgression, so why broadcast it to the masses? How about to send a clear message to players that there is no place in the game for these behaviors? Or to show tour members that they will be held publicly accountable for their misbehavior, which can itself serve as a strong deterrent?The exception is doping offenses, but since the PGA Tour initiated its drug testing policy in 2009, it has ensnared only the journeyman golfer Doug Barron, who tested positive for synthetic testosterone that year.In the summer of 2011, tour officials warned players about using Ultimate Spray, made of deer antler velvet, and advised Mark Calcavecchia, a one-time major winner, to stop endorsing the product.A year and a half later, Singh, a three-time major winner and former world No. 1 with 34 tour victories, is on the record saying he used deer antler spray “every couple of hours.”“I’m looking forward to some changes in my body,” said Singh, a 49-year-old known for his maniacal fitness regimen, in Sports Illustrated. “It’s really hard to feel the difference if you’re only doing it for a couple of months.”In a statement released Wednesday, Singh, who is entered in this week’s Waste Management Open, confirmed that he used deer antler spray but said that “at no time was I aware that it may contain a substance that is banned under the PGA Tour antidoping policy.”“In fact, when I first received the product, I reviewed the list of ingredients and did not see any prohibited substances,” he said. “I am absolutely shocked that deer antler spray may contain a banned substance and am angry that I have put myself in this position.”The tour’s antidoping manual, which includes IGF-1 under the heading “Peptide hormones, growth factors and related substances,” makes plain that ignorance is not a defense. It says, “It does not matter whether you unintentionally or unknowingly used a prohibited substance.” It also states, “It is each player’s personal duty to ensure that no prohibited substance enters his body.”The tour said it had begun a review process, per its antidoping policy. But if Singh does not end up with a suspension, what message will that send about a sport that, for integrity’s sake, expects players to call infractions on themselves?A player committing a first-time antidoping rule violation under the program is subject to up to a one-year suspension and can be fined up to $500,000.Bubba Watson, the reigning Masters champion, was asked Wednesday what he knew about deer antler spray.“I know somehow it’s illegal,” said Watson, who made it clear he could not imagine using deer antler spray as anything but a punch line.“It’s sad that people live and die by their sport and they have to, I guess, cheat and go around it and try to better themselves with deer antler spray,” he said.With its first major doping imbroglio, golf has officially reached the sporting big time. The question is, will its response befit a sport of its stature?"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/world/middleeast/some-fear-a-soccer-teams-racist-fans-mirror-israel.html,"JERUSALEM — The shouting match began long before kickoff, and many of the slogans had little to do with soccer.“The Temple Mount is in our hands,” chanted the notoriously aggressive fans of the home team, Beitar Jerusalem.The visitors from Umm al-Fahm, an Arab-Israeli town, had their own provocations. “With blood and fire, we will liberate Palestine,” they called in Hebrew.The angry, defiant exchanges that punctuated Tuesday night’s unusually tense game here came amid intense protests by Beitar Jerusalem supporters over the team owner’s plans to recruit two Muslim players from Chechnya. Some young men had unfurled a banner at the previous game declaring “Beitar pure forever,” which reminded many here of Nazi Germany’s purging of Jews from athletics in 1933 and prompted statewide discussion about racism on and off the field.“People in Israel usually try to locate Beitar Jerusalem as some kind of the more extreme fringe; this is a way to overcome the embarrassment,” said Moshe Zimmermann, a historian at Hebrew University who specializes in sports. “The fact is that the Israeli society on the whole is getting more racist, or at least more ethnocentric, and this is an expression.”Reaction to the purity banner, perhaps the most controversial in a series of Beitar outbursts, was swift. One of the fans who made the sign was arrested and banned from games for the season. Fifty more were barred from Tuesday’s match, along with banners of all kinds, and the team was fined about $13,500, amid concerns that the episode could threaten Israel’s scheduled hosting of a European Under 21 soccer tournament in June.President Shimon Peres sent the soccer association a sharply worded letter, and Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister who has been one of Beitar’s biggest financial boosters, wrote a much-discussed opinion article in the newspaper Yediot Aharanot declaring he would no longer be seen in the stands.“The competition has long since stopped being of a sportsmanship nature,” Mr. Olmert wrote. “Either we remove this group of racists from our field and cut it off from the team, or we are all like them.”Beitar, which was founded in 1936 and is the only one of Israel’s 30 professional soccer teams never to have had a single Arab player, has a long history of ugly fan behavior. Last March, hundreds stormed a mall near the stadium and beat up several Arab workers. A Nigerian Muslim who joined the team in 2004 quit after a year of harassment.But such conflagrations are not limited to soccer. Last summer, a mob of Jewish teenagers pummeled a Palestinian youth nearly to death in what was widely condemned as an attempted lynching. While last week’s election results were widely seen as slowing Israel’s slide to the right, Yair Lapid, whose centrist party came in a strong second, was criticized for saying afterward that he would not form a coalition with “Zoabis,” a reference to an Arab-Israeli lawmaker.Nor are the tensions only between Israel’s 1.5 million Arab citizens and its six million Jews. A left-leaning lawmaker filed a complaint with the elections commission this month asserting that a campaign advertisement  depicting a blond Russian woman getting a conversion certificate faxed to her under the wedding canopy — as opposed to going through a substantive religious process as now required — was “racist and presents the immigrant population in a ridiculous light.” Last spring, Israeli lawmakers used racial slurs during protests against the influx of migrant workers from Africa, with one eventually apologizing for calling them “a cancer in our body.”Adalah, a legal center for Arabs in Israel, counted 20 discriminatory laws passed by the current Parliament, including one restricting residency in certain communities. Nidal Othman, director of the Coalition Against Racism in Israel, said there had been a 20 percent to 30 percent increase in “racist incidents” in the past two years.“When talking about Beitar, it’s actually showing a mirror for the Israeli society,” said Mr. Othman, a lawyer with the Mossawa Center, which advocates for civil and human rights. “The political leaders and the religious leaders of the community are feeding the society with different racist incitements — against Arabs at all, against Muslims at all and against different groups in Israel.”Soccer, Israel’s national sport, has long been tinged by conflict because, as Professor Zimmermann put it, “In Israel, you cannot disconnect politics from whatever you do.” The major teams — Beitar, Maccabi and Hapoel — began as outgrowths of political movements and remain psychically linked to various parties. Beitar is Likud, the right-leaning faction headed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, though in recent years it has also been associated with extremists amid the growth of a virulent fan group known as La Familia.Abbas Swan, who spent three years on the Israeli national team and about 15 in professional soccer, said playing against Beitar “gave me more energy and more power.”“They want to destroy all the society that I love, that I come from,” explained Mr. Swan, 37, now a youth coach. “Your emotion now plays, not your body and not your head. You can give 120 percent, not 100 percent.”At Tuesday’s match, between singing religious songs and hurling vulgar epithets at their opponents, Beitar fans were blunt about their opposition to integrating their beloved team. They added a new chant to their repertoire, attacking the team’s owner, the Russian-Israeli oligarch Arcadi Gaydamak, as “son of a whore” because of his plan to put the Chechens on his roster.“Arabs are impure people,” said Shlomo Buchbut, a 17-year-old student. “We don’t like Muslims.”Lindy Mizrahi, one of the few women in the young, testosterone-filled stands, said she did not agree with the purity banner but nonetheless wanted only Jews to wear her team’s trademark yellow and black. “Beitar is a group of very Zionist Jews who believes that Jerusalem belongs to the Jews,” she explained. “We are for peace — but not inside Beitar.”Avi Cohen, 22, who works in a warehouse, pointed to the Umm al-Fahm fans chanting “Allahu akbar,” which reminded him of what Palestinian suicide bombers said before blowing themselves up during the second intifada, or uprising. “They support and they represent all the terrorists,” Mr. Cohen said.Hundreds of additional police officers deployed for Tuesday’s game removed 25 fans — 20 from Beitar — for racist behavior, and arrested five from Umm al-Fahm, two for attacking officers and three for raising a Palestinian flag.The 1,000 Arabs at the game were sequestered behind locked gates in one corner, where they banged drums, tooted trumpets and clapped hands overhead.“We didn’t come to watch the game,” said Mahmoud Jazmawe, 21, a road paver who was with two cousins. Added Ahmed Mhamed, 19: “They’re always cursing the Prophet Muhammad, so we came to answer back.”Beitar, ranked fourth in the premier league with a record of 8-5-7, dominated its opponent, which plays in the second tier, scoring its first goal within eight minutes and finishing 5-0. Still, said Mohammed Mahamid, 36, a history teacher, “We won big.”“We came to show them what the culture of soccer is and what playing without racism is,” he explained. “We brought a big crowd, we showed a force and that’s a victory.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/sports/hockey/rangers-callahan-out-10-14-days-with-shoulder-injury.html,"GREENBURGH, N.Y. — The Rangers breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday when they learned that the injury to their captain, Ryan Callahan, was not as serious as some had feared.Callahan will be out 10 to 14 days with a subluxation of his left shoulder, the club said after he had a magnetic resonance imaging exam.If the estimate proves accurate, Callahan will miss four to six games, starting with Thursday’s game at Madison Square Garden against the Pittsburgh Penguins. If he were to miss six games, he would return with 36 of the Rangers’ 48 games remaining.A subluxation is a form of dislocation. Had the dislocation been more severe or required surgery, Callahan could have been out for eight weeks or longer.“You don’t fill his role,” Coach John Tortorella said of Callahan, an all-purpose forward and United States Olympian who skates on the first power-play unit, kills penalties and plays a high-energy forechecking, shot-blocking game.“People get moved up now,” Tortorella added, before the results of the M.R.I. exam were known. “It shuffles the lineup, and it gives other guys chances they probably wouldn’t get if he was playing.”Callahan hurt his shoulder during a postwhistle wrestling match with Max Talbot five minutes into the third period of the Rangers’ 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers on Tuesday night. Earlier in the game, he scored the goal that gave the Rangers a 2-0 lead.Callahan and Talbot tangled after a goal-mouth scramble in the Flyers’ end of the rink. Callahan’s arm was wedged in an awkward position as Talbot was pulling it, and Callahan shouted in pain as he fell to the ice. “We were holding each other up and his shoulder popped out or something,” Talbot told NHL.com. “It was unfortunate. I let him go. I kind of felt it, but then I saw his face as well.”Callahan and Talbot were each given roughing penalties on the play. Tuesday’s game was the first this season that the Rangers (3-3) were not assessed a fighting major.“That’s hockey,” the Rangers’ Rick Nash said Wednesday. “That’s what happens when you play as hard as Cally does. He’s not going to let someone take advantage of him. It’s just kind of a freak thing that happened.”Marian Gaborik had shoulder surgery to repair a torn labrum in the off-season, and it took about seven months for him to fully recover. After talking to Callahan at the Rangers’ practice rink Wednesday, Gaborik said he thought that Callahan’s injury would be relatively mild.“I don’t think it’s going to be a long time,” Gaborik said. “Mine wasn’t as sudden — his shoulder came out.”Still, Gaborik said, Callahan’s absence would be “a big loss.”Callahan has two goals in six games this season and is tied for second in the N.H.L. with 27 hits. He is sixth among league forwards with nine blocked shots.The Rangers cannot rely on Chris Kreider to return to the lineup immediately to replace Callahan. Kreider told reporters Wednesday that he was still day to day with a chipped ankle he sustained when he was struck by a shot in an American Hockey League game in early January. He played with the injury in the Rangers’ first three games.The number of available free agents also shrank earlier this week when Petr Sykora, who scored 21 goals last season with the Devils, signed with Bern of the Swiss National League A.That left another call-up from the Rangers’ A.H.L. affiliate in Connecticut as the strongest possibility. Kris Newbury, Connecticut’s top scorer and a frequent fighter, has already been called up for one game this season. So has another rugged forward, Brandon Segal.Callahan’s shoulder subluxation was the fourth significant injury he has sustained in his seven-year N.H.L. career. In 2010-11 he broke an ankle when he was hit by a Zdeno Chara slap shot in the second-to-last game of the regular season. His absence was glaring as the Rangers fell to Washington in five games in the first round of the playoffs.In 2009-10, he missed 19 games with a broken hand, also the result of being hit by a shot. In 2007-8, he missed a month because of a sprained knee."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/sports/football/in-super-bowl-city-scars-remain-where-the-water-receded.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Back in town for the Super Bowl, Marshall Faulk paid a visit Tuesday to his alma mater, George Washington Carver High School. It was a place both familiar and foreign, a rearranged tableau that he found encouraging and discouraging and, for a second, a bit disorienting.He is the school’s greatest athlete, a Hall of Fame running back, a man who made his living with an acute inner gyroscope. But Faulk needed a moment to recall the exact location of the football field before the playing surface and the school and this area of the Ninth Ward were devastated by Hurricane Katrina.“Here,” he said in the parking lot, getting his bearings, realizing that he was standing in the place where two decades earlier he had run for so many yards and played so many positions that he often left the field only at halftime and after the final whistle.Seven and a half years after the storm, the original Carver High has been razed in an isolated, battered neighborhood that will probably draw few visitors during Super Bowl week except those gawking on disaster tours. Carver’s students still attend class in temporary buildings. Bungalows, Faulk calls them graciously. Trailers is the term used by the principal. The basketball team has no gym. Until the Rams secured a court at a nearby elementary school, they began this season practicing outdoors.When the football team reached the state playoffs in November, someone donated a single generator-powered light to provide meager illumination during late-afternoon workouts. It was only enough to avoid being smothered by a blanket of darkness, but Carver persevered and advanced to the quarterfinals.A plaque honoring Faulk’s 2011 induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame will go on prominent display at Carver when a new school is built. For now, it remains hidden away, secured in a crate.“These trailers are not very safe,” said Isaac Pollack, Carver’s first-year principal. “The way security is on the weekends, it’s not worth the risk.”A new $52 million Carver High is planned, but bids recently came in significantly over budget and were rejected by school district officials. Plans are being redrawn. Meanwhile, officials still hope to break ground soon on a separate project, using $1.4 million in donations to build a football and track stadium that would feature artificial turf, lighting and up to 2,000 seats. The field would be made available to other schools and would allow the track team to quit training along campus breezeways and on the potholed Louisa Street that runs in front of Carver.“It’s a matter of cutting through red tape and hanging on,” said Brian Bordainick, a former athletic director at Carver who has marshaled the stadium project since 2008. “I hope this creates a new normal for a generation of kids who grow up thinking, ‘This is my community; this is what I expect to play on.’ ”Yet aspiration and reality have not always coincided in the recovery from Katrina. The halting pace left Faulk with self-described feelings of ambivalence upon his return to Carver. “When I go back, I still get a little upset at having it be like that,” said Faulk, who will turn 40 next month and is an analyst for the NFL Network. “Those memories, playing here. You can’t get those back. Does that anger me? Yes. It gets the emotions going.”But he also reminded himself that if Carver is not yet rebuilt, at least it remains open. Many schools in the area are closed. Even before Katrina, Faulk noted, it was challenging to convince kids in the impoverished neighborhood to come to school and stay in school and believe that an education would get them anywhere. The parents and alumni who fought to keep Carver open, he said, understood that busing students to other parts of the city would only add another layer of risk and discouragement.“It creates more of an epidemic that we’re trying to get rid of in our country,” Faulk said. Through the years, he has assisted his alma mater with donations for uniforms, playoff travel expenses and renovations to the stadium in City Park, where Carver plays its home games. He is also helping to rebuild a park where he played youth football. Faulk’s presence on campus, where he once worked early mornings in the boiler room and took cold showers to wash off the grit before classes began, brings confirmation of “what can be accomplished with hard work and perseverance,” said Walter Harris, the current athletic director at Carver.An Altered LandscapeEverything has changed in the neighborhood since Katrina. It is not the home Faulk knew. Even before the storm, the place where he grew up as the youngest of six boys, the notorious Desire Housing Project, was torn down. It was a place so threatening that, during Faulk’s freshman season at San Diego State in 1991, his high school coach, Wayne Reese, told The New York Times: “I was worried he and the other kids would get a stray bullet. We tell them, ‘Go home, stay there, don’t come out.’ For one hour, after practice, they would each call me and check in. We never wanted darkness to catch them.”Mixed income housing, known as The Estates, now stands in the Desire neighborhood, colorful duplexes that at least “look much better,” Faulk said as he drove through the area. But it has long been a troubled location. All 425 units in The Estates had water and other storm damage from Hurricane Isaac last August, and residents have complained of shoddy construction and chronic problems with leaks from rainfall, according to reports by thelensnola.org, an independent, nonprofit news site.“It’s just the anger,” Faulk said. “People are upset. They want assistance. They want help.”Just across the Industrial Canal from Carver and the Desire neighborhood, the inundated Lower Ninth Ward became Katrina’s indelible symbol of failed levees and breached recovery. But 15 other neighborhoods “were equally poor and heavily flooded,” said Allison Plyer, the director and chief demographer of the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center. “The Desire area is very similar.”The area surrounding Carver is a jarring incongruity of rejuvenation and abandonment. The high school had about 1,300 students before Katrina and now has 375. A playground is refurbished here, a cluster of homes resettled there. But many houses remain empty, punch-drunk with gaping holes. Just behind the school, three deserted cottages in Easter egg colors still bear search-and-rescue hieroglyphics, the familiar, spray-painted markings written as if in a mortal checkbook. Some have taken to calling the markings Katrina swastikas.The gym at Press Park where Faulk played youth basketball is vacant, discarded, tagged with graffiti, a dumping ground for tires and discarded auto parts. “Could be a dead body in there,” Faulk said. “I ain’t lying.”He pointed out the water mark above the windows on a wrecked home, but there was no locating the house near Carver where Faulk had lived with a friend in his later high school years. “I could have shown you but it’s gone,” Faulk said, his hand sweeping in a gesture of rising, pummeling water.The Savemore Supermarket near Carver is barren, its interior as open as a doll’s house. Many in the area lack transportation and must walk a long distance, or take a taxi, to buy groceries, said Shanda Gentry, the principal at nearby Mays Preparatory School, which is scheduled to close because of poor test scores. The route of the elementary school’s Mardi Gras parade next week was altered, Gentry said, because “we’re in the middle of nowhere.”When Katrina struck early on Aug. 29, 2005, Faulk was in Detroit with the St. Louis Rams, preparing for a preseason game. He remembers nothing about the game, only the television tuned to CNN for days, the despair that his hometown seemed like a third-world country and the dread of not knowing for 48 hours or so that his mother and a brother had safely evacuated to Houston.“It’s like, really, my city?” Faulk said. “You don’t think it can happen. It was tough to look at, tough to understand. Why weren’t the politicians doing anything?”He could not help feeling a twinge of resentment toward what seemed a more urgent government response to Hurricane Sandy on the East Coast. He understands that failures from Katrina led to a greater understanding about disaster response, “but it doesn’t make it any better.” The recovery from Sandy will continue to be used as a measuring stick in New Orleans, Faulk said. “If that surpasses what’s gone on here,” he said, “they’re going to have some issues.”He wrestles with this conundrum: Do ‘they’ care and if ‘they’ do, who are ‘they?’ At the same time, Faulk became a great athlete in part because he sidestepped doubt, always believing that the next touchdown, the next game, would bring a winning result. He is convinced that hosting the Super Bowl is good for New Orleans, validating the sense that it is recovering and remains a major league city.Faulk is hopeful that economic recovery in the French Quarter and the Central Business District will someday spread like the water once did, reaching broken, invisible places like the Carver High area and the Lower Ninth Ward. But he also acknowledges that his life in San Diego is comfortable and distant from his childhood struggles. Those who are still here must live daily with frustrations from Katrina while he does not.It is one thing for him to say that recovery needs more time and patience. He also understands that it can be difficult sharing someone else’s vision of forbearance when you are still waiting to rebuild or living with limited access to health care and fresh food.“You feel sorry for the people that’s living in it because to them, encouraged, discouraged, it doesn’t matter,” Faulk said. “They just want something done. They want a return to normalcy. They want their lives back.”Waiting for the RecoveryOn the St. Claude Avenue Bridge, Faulk drove over the Industrial Canal into the Lower Ninth Ward. This neighborhood, too, bears the jolting contradiction of renewal and desertion.In 2000, just over 14,000 residents lived here; as of the 2010 census there were 2,842 inhabitants, according to figures tracked by the Greater New Orleans Community Data Center. The number of households has decreased from 5,363 to 1,624. Homeownership was higher than the city average before the storm, but the houses were often passed from generation to generation with no legal documentation, which has presented a nightmarish stumbling block to rebuilding. Futuristic houses resembling sci-fi toasters, built by Brad Pitt’s Make It Right Foundation, are juxtaposed with homes exposing their skeletal innards and empty slabs.“You’ve probably never seen stuff growing on top of the roof,” Faulk said as he drove past a house with a tree poking through an attic.Once there were six schools in the Lower Ninth Ward. Now there is only the Martin Luther King Jr. Charter School, which has 800 students in prekindergarten through 12th grade. In the faculty lounge, school officials ticked off a list of services absent from the area: no drugstore, no medical clinic, no barbershop, no grocery store, no fast-food restaurant. The palm trees planted along Claiborne Avenue bring suspicion of temporary Super Bowl sprucing up, not long-term rehabilitation.“We’re the last community to come back,” Doris Hicks, the chief executive and principal of King Charter, said Monday. She posed the question of why and answered it herself. “All you have to do is stop and think: the residents are black.” She added: “Who cares about our situation? I’m not sure the city cares.”Tracie Washington, the school’s general counsel, called the Lower Ninth Ward “the sympathy and money bait” used to entice recovery spending in New Orleans. While no area of the city was more devastated than this one, Washington said: “The money’s not here. That should be a cautionary tale for the recovery from Sandy.”It is hoped that ground will be broken on a separate King High School in March, Hicks said. Meanwhile, the basketball team practices outdoors this winter because the current school has no gym. James Mack, the athletic director and basketball coach, serves as a kind of human thermometer. If he has to put his hands in his pockets, it is too cold to work out.“You can’t practice basketball if you can’t catch it,” Mack said.After more than two hours touring his boyhood neighborhoods, Faulk returned on Tuesday to his hotel in downtown New Orleans. On Sunday, he will attend the championship game at the Superdome, where he once hawked popcorn. His producers at the NFL Network asked whether he had any photographs from those days, but they were lost during Katrina in his mother’s flooded home.Such reminiscing brought “a mixed bag of emotions,” Faulk said. “You feel discouraged with some things, then you feel encouraged by some things. I’m a glass-is-half-full kind of guy. I see that the city is vibrant, bouncing back. A great light is being shined on the city with the Super Bowl being here. I think it’s just a matter of time when those things are going to reach places like the Lower Ninth Ward. I don’t want to say that’s the only area that’s affected. On the outskirts of the city, a lot of areas need improvement. I know there’s people living in those areas who feel like it ain’t happening soon enough. I think, just give it more time. We continue to have Super Bowls here, get the Final Four back, things like we saw today, you’ll start to see more improvement.”Earlier, sitting in the modest bleachers at Carver’s practice field, Faulk tempered the grim surroundings with his favorite high school story. He was a freshman in 1987 and his brother, Joe, was a senior. As older brothers do, Joe ignored Marshall, would not let him even sit at the same table for lunch. Then, during the homecoming game, Faulk entered as a split end. He made a long catch and run down the sideline. His brother, who was not a player, became animated and trailed along the boundary in elation.“I can see my brother acknowledging I was his brother for the first time,” Faulk said, laughing. “I got so excited, I got caught at the 1.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/sports/football/owner-steve-bisciotti-builds-ravens-by-building-relationships.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Just inside the front door of the Baltimore Ravens’ chateau-with-shoulder-pads training center hangs an enormous portrait of the former owner who still hovers over the franchise and the city as surely as that oil painting over the big stone fireplace.You have to look much harder, and down a hallway, to find a picture of the current owner, the one whose dollars financed that lavish building, the one who is quietly accompanying the Ravens to the Super Bowl here this week.That man, Steve Bisciotti, 52, is as low-profile as the 8x10 picture of him at a news conference that hangs on an out-of-the-way wall at the Ravens’ facility. Bisciotti declined interview requests in the weeks leading to the Super Bowl, planning to talk to a few reporters only after he arrived here Thursday.So the conversation this week has been much more about whether the man in the oil painting, Art Modell, who took the Browns out of Cleveland and rebranded them the Ravens in Baltimore, will be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday than about Bisciotti’s first trip to the game as the primary owner of the team.“I’m O.K. if I’m one of the least-known owners in sports,” Bisciotti was quoted as saying in the Ravens’ biography of him.The last time the Ravens raised the Lombardi Trophy, it was in Modell’s hands in 2001. Only months before, Bisciotti had become a minority owner — Modell needed the infusion of cash to secure free agents for that team — with the promise that he could take majority ownership of the team in a few years. He stood unobtrusively in the back of a locker room in Oakland, Calif., as Modell beamed on national television about going to his first Super Bowl.On Jan. 20, when the Ravens beat the New England Patriots to win the A.F.C. championship, most football fans finally got a glimpse of Bisciotti, the league’s second-youngest owner and perhaps its coolest: tanned; hair slicked back; wearing jeans, an open-collared shirt and a duster coat; gently rubbing the arm of Ray Lewis, who was draped over his back while wearing a Modell T-shirt.“In a very positive way, he is engaged,” said Brian Billick, who was the Ravens’ coach when they won the Super Bowl in 2001, was retained by Bisciotti when he took full ownership of the team and then was fired by him after the 2007 season. “He built his fortune on relationships and is very much about that. It’s not a ‘I’m in charge, do what I say’ mentality. It’s an ‘I don’t care if you’re the ball boy or the head coach, we’ve got to create partnerships here.’ He hires people he trusts and then keeps a purposefully, painfully low profile. He never wants to make it about him.”Bisciotti grew up near Annapolis, Md., going to Orioles and Colts games — where he sat on the 10-yard line — with his older brother and sister and with his father, Bernard. They would sometimes go to the Colts’ training camp, where Bisciotti asked players if he could try on their helmets. In the Ravens’ media guide, there is a picture of a young Bisciotti standing beside Johnny Unitas.Bernard died when Bisciotti was 8, but Bisciotti’s mother, Patricia, is a huge fan of Baltimore sports teams and Notre Dame, and she fed her youngest son’s love of sports, although he played football only briefly in high school.According to a profile in Forbes magazine, Bisciotti spent his high school summers building piers near Baltimore. But at 23, after he graduated from Salisbury State University, he started a staffing firm in a basement with his cousin. It provided temporary employees — engineers — to the aerospace and technology industries.Forbes reported that Bisciotti became obsessed with making enough money by the time he was 35 so his wife and children would not have to work if he, like his father, died young. According to the Ravens, the company he started, now known as the Allegis Group, is the largest privately held staffing firm in the country. Bisciotti is worth around $1.5 billion, according to calculations Forbes made last year.In 2000, Bisciotti purchased a minority stake in the Ravens, then largely stayed hidden, trying to learn from Modell. That, Billick said, eased the transition for Ravens employees who might have been caught in a tense situation. Even after Bisciotti took full control of the team in 2004, Modell was a frequent presence, watching games from a suite at the stadium and practices from a perch on a golf cart.“He treated him with dignity, compassion and made him feel he was still part of the organization,” the Giants owner John Mara said. “A lot of owners would not have handled it the same way. They would have loved to push the guy aside.”Those at the Ravens who have worked with Bisciotti say he has a similar gentle touch with his employees. Billick said Bisciotti would come to the team’s training facility about once a week, but was just as apt to talk with the receptionist as he was with Billick or General Manager Ozzie Newsome. Bisciotti is not active in league matters, sometimes skipping meetings and sending the team president Dick Cass in his place. And he has stepped out of owners’ meetings, shutting the door behind him, to smoke one of his cigars.The former Ravens kicker Matt Stover said he once heard Bisciotti say, “I know I don’t know football, therefore, I hire people who do,” a sentiment that Stover respected. Still, Bisciotti put his stamp on the Ravens when he made the unorthodox decision to hire John Harbaugh, a special-teams coach, to replace Billick. That reflected his real skill: making connections.“He’s got a tremendous ability to have a good feel of people,” said the former Maryland men’s basketball coach Gary Williams, who has been a friend of Bisciotti — a passionate Terrapins fan — for 20 years. “That is a big part of his decision-making. One of Steve’s strengths is his ability to read people. I coached a long time, that’s as important as anything I did: getting a feel for people you’re recruiting, coaches you work with. I just watch that, it’s a big part of his organization.”Bisciotti became a sounding board for Williams when he was coaching, but at basketball games Bisciotti is thoroughly a fan, screaming at officials from courtside. Forbes reported that he shuttles friends to Maryland games on a private jet.“He’s a man’s man,” Billick said. “He’ll go drink for drink, cigar for cigar. You’re going to lose that battle, I promise you.”But it is at Ravens games that the full snapshot of Bisciotti appears. He has attended preseason games in shorts and flip-flops, and his closest friends — many of them from his youth — mingle in his box with his mother and an occasional priest, a reflection of his strong Catholic faith and his support of religious charities.“When you get to Steve’s level of success, he worked really hard, you’re really grateful for how far you’ve come, you’re really grateful for the people who helped you,” said Kevin Plank, a friend of Bisciotti’s and the founder of the Under Armour apparel company, which is based in Baltimore. “There’s that idea of sitting around with four buddies in a treehouse — ‘If you hit the lottery what would you do? I’d buy a team and bring you guys to games, we’d still hang out on weekends.’ You’d say, ‘Yeah, right, you’d change.’“Steve is still the guy who sits up in the treehouse with the guys,” Plank said. “He’d probably be playing pool or darts and taking money off his friends. I speak from experience. Not enough to break you, but just enough to remind you who’s in charge.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/sports/baseball/blocking-path-of-baseballs-drug-inquiries.html,"WASHINGTON — As the United States Anti-Doping Agency moved forward last year with its investigation into Lance Armstrong, it used a powerful tool in building its case: the ability to offer other cyclists reduced suspensions if they provided information about Armstrong’s doping.Similar to how prosecutors try to persuade lower-level drug dealers to share information about their superiors, the antidoping agency sat down one by one with cyclists from Armstrong’s teams. Ultimately, 11 agreed to cooperate.Major League Baseball and its players union have declined to operate under the jurisdiction of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, and baseball’s antidoping program gives its leaders no such leverage. That point was painfully clear in the wake of a report on Tuesday from a newspaper in Miami that said Alex Rodriguez and several other high-profile baseball players received banned substances from a South Florida anti-aging clinic.While the league’s investigators are attempting to learn as much as they can about the report, they are hamstrung by players’ longstanding refusals to speak to them and by the federal government’s reluctance to provide baseball with information it has uncovered in its own investigations.Unlike cyclists, major league players are represented by a union that for many years steadfastly refused to adopt drug testing and is a fierce protector of players’ rights.In one of the few instances in which an active player has spoken to the commissioner’s office about drug use, the players union insisted that the player, Jason Giambi, be questioned only about his use and not other players’. Giambi was questioned by George J. Mitchell, who was conducting an investigation into the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball.In Mitchell’s report, which was released in December 2007, he described how “one former player told of annual players-only meetings during which teammates reminded one another that any personal information they learned during the season needed to be kept in ‘the family.’ ”The player told Mitchell that “a failure to abide by this unwritten rule would sound the death knell for their careers.”Another former player told Mitchell through the player’s lawyer “that his career as a major league coach would be harmed ‘perhaps fatally’ if he were required to identify other players who had admitted to him that they had used steroids.”In the years that have passed since the Mitchell report’s release, the only players known to have spoken with baseball’s investigators have been those accused of using drugs themselves. No players have been suspended based on testimony provided by other players.It is not clear whether the commissioner’s office would offer a player a reduced suspension if he provided information on other players — or even if that kind of arrangement is permissible under the collective bargaining agreement, which stipulates the drug-testing protocols.Without such cooperation, Major League Baseball will be forced to rely on federal authorities, who are believed to be conducting an investigation into the South Florida clinic.After it was revealed in 2010 that a Canadian doctor was under investigation for distributing performance-enhancing drugs to professional athletes, investigators for baseball tried on several occasions to persuade the authorities to provide them with information the authorities had found in the course of their investigation.Those authorities refused, citing a continuing investigation. But even after the doctor, Anthony Galea, pleaded guilty in 2011 to smuggling human growth hormone into the United States from Canada, the authorities once again refused baseball’s request for information.Baseball’s frustrations with those authorities were similar to ones they had in 2007 when prosecutors in Albany investigated a string of anti-aging clinics. On several occasions, investigators for baseball asked for evidence they had found that linked nearly a dozen players to purchases of growth hormone. Although several news media outlets were given that evidence, the authorities gave baseball officials evidence on only a couple of players.Baseball officials had the same problem during the federal investigation that started in 2002 into the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative. During that investigation, the grand jury transcripts of Giambi and Barry Bonds were obtained by The San Francisco Chronicle, not by baseball’s investigators.Baseball officials asked federal authorities for copies of the grand jury transcripts, but the authorities said they would be able to hand them over only when the investigation was complete. The investigation has still not officially been closed.The most cooperation that baseball has received from the authorities was during Mitchell’s investigation into the use of banned substances in the game, which he conducted on behalf of Commissioner Bud Selig. The authorities persuaded two New York-based steroid dealers to cooperate with Mitchell in exchange for not going to prison.The dealers provided Mitchell with documents and testimony that linked dozens of players to the use of steroids and human growth hormone. In December 2007, Mitchell named those players — including Roger Clemens and Andy Pettitte — based on information provided by the dealers.The players named in Mitchell’s report, however, were never punished. As part of an agreement to toughen baseball’s drug testing program in response to recommendations in the report, the commissioner’s office and the players union agreed to let the players off.Armstrong, meanwhile, has been barred from Olympic sports for life. In recent interviews, he has complained about the handling of his case, saying it was unfair for other cyclists to receive lesser punishments. Those cyclists, however, agreed to come clean with antidoping officials as Armstrong continued to lie.Baseball officials may wish they could achieve similar results with the current case in South Florida. The players, however, will most likely see little reason to cooperate."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/sports/football/super-bowl-ravens-harbaugh-put-muhammad-ali-in-their-corner.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Jim and John Harbaugh compete on many levels, most notably as coaches of opposing teams in the Super Bowl on Sunday. But when it comes to inspirational first fans, John seems to have the upper hand.After all, the Ravens have had Muhammad Ali in their corner.Before their season opener in September, John Harbaugh, Baltimore’s coach, arranged for Ali to make a surprise visit to the Ravens’ practice. Ali spent about an hour with the players and some of their children, and he posed for pictures and shook some hands. Two days later, Ali watched the Ravens beat the Cincinnati Bengals.Although Ali was with the Ravens only briefly, the players continued to talk about his visit during the season, especially his message to them about the need to earn respect.“Any time you get support from someone like that, it definitely means a lot,” Jack Cornell, an offensive lineman on the Ravens’ practice squad, said Tuesday. “For him to stand up and do the things he did, it really took sports and this country to another level.”Ali and his wife, Lonnie, struck by the team’s passion and energy, have continued to follow the Ravens.“We were totally taken,” Lonnie Ali said in an e-mail. “It wasn’t one thing but everything about the Ravens that impressed us, starting with the coach. They are a family, and we felt like family. We became fans.”The Alis even sent Harbaugh a text message before the Ravens beat the New England Patriots in the A.F.C. championship game that said they were proud of the team. In the note, Muhammad Ali also said, “If I had wings, I’d be there with you.”Harbaugh invited the Alis to New Orleans to watch the Super Bowl this Sunday, the Ravens spokesman Kevin Byrne said, but they decided to watch the game at home in Arizona instead.“I’ll be shouting and screaming and acting like a crazy fan rooting for the Ravens,” Lonnie Ali wrote. “Muhammad will be doing his usual thing: watching quietly and intently and hopefully praying when I ask him.”Muhammad Ali is no stranger to Jim and John Harbaugh. Their father, Jack, used to watch boxing on television with their grandfather, who was a big fan of the sport. It was then that “it all came together how Muhammad Ali, he used boxing as a platform for love, especially with children, especially with the downtrodden and people who were at a little bit of a disadvantage,” Jack Harbaugh said Wednesday. “He became my hero.”Jack Harbaugh coached football for more than a decade at Western Kentucky in Bowling Green, Ky., about a 115-mile drive south from Louisville, Ali’s hometown.When his sons were young, Jack used to recount Ali’s title bout against Ernie Terrell in 1967. Like Floyd Patterson before him, Terrell called Ali by his given name, Cassius Clay, even after Ali had changed it to reflect his devotion to Islam.As he hit Terrell during the lopsided bout, an angry Ali yelled, “What’s my name?”About a dozen years ago, Jack Harbaugh started incorporating the story into motivational speeches he gave to different teams, including those coached by his sons. In 2008, John’s first year as the coach of the Ravens, Jack came to talk. As a coda, he told the players that no one knew their name and that they would have to win to earn their rivals’ respect. During team huddles thereafter, John Harbaugh would yell, “What’s my name?” The players would respond, “Baltimore Ravens,” three times.The story caught on. The Ravens’ marketing staff promoted the line, and fans started wearing T-shirts that bore the phrase “What’s my name?”When Jack addressed the team in September, John arranged for Ali, who was in Baltimore to promote his charity, to drive onto the field in a golf cart just as his father was reaching a peak. As the golf cart approached, the players realized who was in it. When Ali arrived, he nodded for Jack to finish the story.“When I saw him, I was just shocked,” Ravens fullback Vonta Leach said of Ali. “Just to be able to shake his hand was awesome. Just spending a lot of his time with us, that was really special.”The 49ers have their own inspirations. A few weeks after he spoke to the Ravens, Jack flew to California to meet with Jim. After a practice, Jim said he would drive his father home, but he made an unexpected stop at a different house.After knocking on the door, they were taken to a study where Willie Mays — “the greatest baseball player to ever live, in my opinion,” Jack said — was watching the San Francisco Giants play the Cincinnati Reds in the playoffs.Not wanting to favor either son, Jack declined to say which team had the better inspirational hero.“I’m not going there,” he said. “No one trumps anybody.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/sports/football/ravens-ed-reed-returns-to-louisiana-for-the-super-bowl.html,"DESTREHAN, La. — This is the place that gave Ed Reed the feeling he does not want to lose, where the gray door opens to the narrow tunnel with the wooden benches on each side.Reed would line up here with the rest of the Destrehan Wildcats on humid Friday nights, the tall banks of lights visible from way back on the two-lane road that leads to the school. He would pass under the red tin sign over his head — “Earn Respect Tonight” — and out onto the field ringed by a track and the bleachers full of his neighbors.Jeanne Hall wants Reed — Edward, she still calls him — to retire. She is an academic counselor at Destrehan High School and has known the boy who became one of the greatest safeties in football history since he was a youngster, when he always hung out with the older players at her home.She cooked a lot of spaghetti for those boys, and Reed eventually moved in with Hall’s family so that she could make sure he got to school on time.She hates to see him, in his 11th N.F.L. season, hit people now. Reed sometimes jokes that she should have let him play baseball when a major league organization came calling with an offer and Hall reminded him that he had already committed to play football at the University of Miami.She has told him he will know in his heart when it is time to go, but she knows that is not true. In his heart, Reed will always want to play. The decision to go will have to come from his head. In his head now, though, are the memories of those Friday nights.“I said, ‘Remember, play like it’s a Friday night,’ ” Hall said this week. “He tells me all the time: ‘It’s like coming up the tunnel at Destrehan — the Friday night lights on, everybody in the stands. That’s what’s fun. That’s what’s football.’ All through Miami, through Baltimore, he says you never want to lose that feeling in your gut before you run out.”Reed has come home for his first Super Bowl, past the old sugar plantations that now provide tours, past the looming grain elevator, to this tiny town of small, neat homes hard by the east bank of the Mississippi River, about 25 miles west of the Superdome, where Reed will take the field Sunday with the Baltimore Ravens.Destrehan High — buy your yearbook, the reminders at the front entrance say — is about 10 minutes down River Road from St. Rose, the small town where Reed grew up, and right past Harry Hurst Middle School, the site of the old Destrehan campus and of violent protests during integration in the 1970s. A white student was killed there, after a white mob attacked a bus full of black students and a shot rang out. A black teenager was sent to prison, and somehow the white supremacist David Duke became involved.This is where Reed grew up and still returns each off-season, for his golf tournament and his football camp for 300 local children. This is where he was the high school charmer whom all the girls loved, able to buffalo anybody, Hall said, and make his coaches and friends laugh. Reed was hoping to get back this week — it would have to be on the sly, Hall said — in between the practices and the news conferences.But the truth is that Reed never really leaves for long, and Destrehan certainly has not left him. Not the shaves the coaches make the players have before games, not the discipline they teach by forbidding them to go beyond the red floor tiles in the doorway from the locker room to the coaches’ office.“There is so much that the South has been through that I knew about that really prepared me for the process that I have gone through up until this point in my career,” Reed said in an interview last week. “Just being from Louisiana, being from the southern part of Louisiana, Metairie, close to New Orleans and growing up in St. Rose. There are a lot of things to overcome.“Just the whole process, like I said, from where I’ve come through, what my people have been through, what my dad has been through, going to my high school back in the ’60s and ’70s. It was different growing up there. You drive past plantations. I ride past plantations. But there were so many people from either side of race that helped me get to where I am at. It wasn’t about racism that prepared me the way I am. It’s more about good people and good hearts that really helped me to get to where I’m at.”A few days ago, Hall was on the phone with Reed. She was in charge of placing the order for the crawfish boil he had in mind for 30 of his teammates, so she spent the morning going over what they needed.Seventy pounds of crawfish, 25 pounds of shrimp, 60 pieces of corn. Do you do turkey necks? she asked the place that would deliver all the food to the team hotel. Fifteen pounds of turkey necks, and 30 pounds of boiled potatoes, because all the guys — even the ones like Anquan Boldin, who Hall said would not touch the rest — would eat those.While on the phone with Reed, Hall mentioned something about him coming out of the tunnel at the Superdome on Sunday night and said she thought she might cry.“I said, ‘Hold on, am I going to be there, huh, baby?’ ” Hall said. “He said, ‘I gotcha.’ ”Reed will have a crowd at the Super Bowl. His parents will be there, as will Hall’s brood of eight and Reed’s three surviving brothers. Two years ago, Reed’s younger brother Brian apparently jumped into the Mississippi while fleeing a sheriff deputy who had stopped to help Brian move a car, which had run out of gas. Then the deputy got a call that the car was being used without authorization; Reed’s parents had called the authorities, fearing for their son’s safety.When the deputy went back to pat Brian down, Brian ran. His body was found a few weeks later in the water. Local reports said Brian had been struggling with mental illness.“It hit hard,” Stephen Robicheaux, Destrehan’s football coach, said of the effect Brian’s death had on Reed. “I think he felt that because he wasn’t around — not guilty, but he felt he could have helped out.”Reed is very spiritual, Hall said, and he believes Brian’s death is part of God’s plan. On Monday, just after the Ravens arrived in New Orleans, Reed spoke briefly about him.“He’s looking down on me right now, I already know,” Reed said. “He’s here with me.”Reed then added what his brother’s message to him might be: “Knock a head off or two.”That, Reed has always been able to do. Just inside the front entrance to the high school is a photograph of him — he is running with the ball against the Jets — tacked to a board of renowned students. Another image of Reed, down on one knee as a college freshman in the orange jersey of the Hurricanes, posing with the team’s coach at the time, Butch Davis, hangs by the locker room.Reed’s legend started here, maybe on the day at rival Thibodaux High when a district track meet and a baseball game were taking place side by side. Reed played both sports, so he shuttled back and forth, playing ball, then throwing the javelin, then returning to the diamond.When the high school retired his jersey in 2005, before a Ravens preseason game against the Saints, Ray Lewis, Deion Sanders, Ozzie Newsome, Brian Billick and Rex Ryan turned out.In a red No. 1 uniform that day, waiting to unveil the plaque, was Reed’s baby brother Edwin, a receiver.“If you watch Ed walk, he’s so pigeon-toed,” Robicheaux said. “His little brother was getting ready to play. He came in, the very first thing I looked at was how he walked. I said, ‘Yes!’ He had the same walk as Ed. I thought he could be a good player for us.”Reed said his father, a welder who did not want him to grow up to have the same job, gave him his athleticism and his love of playing. His coaches describe Reed as an old soul — his favorite musician is Frankie Beverly — and he has always gravitated toward adults.“My dad was playing softball and basketball, intramural sports that still go on in Louisiana at parks,” Reed said. “He brought me everywhere with him. I was at every park watching him play sports or playing sports on the side. My older brother, he did everything. He played baseball, he played basketball. Just being able to watch him as a youngster, wanting to be like him, wanting to play on the team with him and watching those older guys in my neighborhood play sports.“I was always that young kid on the side watching him and wanting to be in the game but was never picked. The old G’s, or the gangsters, turned me away from the street because they knew my dad, and they had a lot of respect for my dad, but because I was an athlete. I was the one being pushed away from the drugs. It was more of a family community then than it is now for the youth.”Reed has gray in his hair now, but he remembers those days so vividly that it informs his decisions to donate to the neighborhoods around Destrehan. He finances a scholarship for a football player who does not otherwise receive one. He sent clothes when a rival high school was flooded. At his camp — a four-day amalgamation of football and spontaneous bowling trips; of coaching from the likes of Lewis and Reggie Wayne; and of a stand serving snowballs, a New Orleans ice dessert — he often supplies shoes.Reed will run out of the tunnel Sunday night. But he has never strayed too far from home.“I know the hustle that is in Louisiana,” Reed said. “Knowing where you are from, really where you’re from, helps you to help the community. That’s every city, but New Orleans is just different. We have big hearts, but it’s just a matter of us having the information, having the people to push you along like I had.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/sports/football/ravens-joe-flacco-and-49ers-colin-kaepernick-match-in-strong-arm-tactics.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Neither quarterback in Super Bowl XLVII will win any Mr. Universe competition. Baltimore’s Joe Flacco boasts the muscle tone of an insurance salesman. San Francisco’s Colin Kaepernick looks more like a surfer. Both are tall and gangly and somewhat awkward, built more like cyclists than football players.Yet these quarterbacks also possess two of the strongest arms in the N.F.L., two million-dollar limbs that draw hyperbolic comparisons to cannons and shotguns and catapults, basically anything that shoots objects really far or really fast.The matchup of two physically unimposing players who are also so physically gifted underscores important matters in regard to throwing mechanics and the term “arm strength.” The latter is something of a misnomer; arm strength has little to do with the size of a quarterback’s biceps or the actual strength of the arm. The former involves the entire body and starts not with the arm but with the feet.Case in point: Flacco. Case in point, Part 2: Kaepernick.“Look at someone like John Elway, like Brett Favre,” said Jim Miller, a retired quarterback and an analyst for SiriusXM NFL Radio. “They could do physically what other players could not do. Both Colin and Joe Flacco are like that.”Growing up, Kaepernick played baseball. Naturally, he pitched. His fastball reached 94 miles per hour, and he threw two no-hitters in high school. The Chicago Cubs drafted him despite his greater interest in football, which seemed misguided way back then.Kaepernick received one offer of an N.C.A.A. Division I football scholarship, from Nevada. He blew away the Wolf Pack coaches in only one regard: arm strength.“That’s the one thing that stood out,” said Chris Ault, his college coach. “He had a gun. His passes actually whistled.”Kaepernick’s throwing motion, though, left much to be desired. He delivered passes sidearm, without an arc. Early in his career, Kaepernick threw often while rolling right, because he could easily launch the ball deep and back across the field. One of his darts left an imprint of laces on a receiver. Another hit a tight end in the face mask from more than 50 yards away.The 49ers tell similar stories of an arm they have come to fear in practice and revere in games. Receiver Michael Crabtree said players would rotate back in line during passing drills to avoid Kaepernick’s turn to throw. Tight end Vernon Davis described Kaepernick as a “freak,” adding, “He’ll take your fingers off if you don’t watch it.” Davis also said that sometimes, he needed to chase Kaepernick from the weight room.Flacco’s arm strength is less obvious but no less potent. He also played some baseball. He once fired a 40-yard out route against Miami that traveled no more than six feet off the ground, toward a receiver near the sideline, according to Gil Brandt, a longtime N.F.L. personnel evaluator and a SiriusXM analyst. Flacco’s 70-yard touchdown pass to receiver Jacoby Jones this postseason traveled beyond where Denver’s secondary believed Flacco could heave it. Safety Rahim Moore fell as the ball sailed over his head.Despite Flacco’s and Kaepernick’s ability to throw far and fast, however, Brandt and others argued that arm strength on its own garnered too much attention. When Brandt worked for the Cowboys, they used a radar gun on potential prospects. One player, whose name he could not recall, registered throws at 60 m.p.h. Phil Simms clocked in at 49.Guess how that turned out.Brandt was more interested in quarterbacks who threw accurate passes, who had strong work ethics, who did not linger on mistakes. He ranked arm strength as the eighth- or ninth-most fundamental attribute in a quarterback. For every rifle-armed Elway, there was a Joe Montana, king of the soft touch. Brandt said Rudy Bukich was the hardest thrower he ever saw. Bukich played 14 seasons in the 1950s and ’60s, but he threw more interceptions than touchdowns.“Arm strength is not as important as you’re often led to believe,” Brandt said.It helps, though. Just ask Warren Moon. He ranked arm strength, after accuracy and the ability to make every throw, third among his most important attributes. He could zing passes accurately more than 50 yards. This helped carry him into the Pro Football Hall of Fame.Moon knew his arm strength came from his throwing motion, not his figurative guns. That is why he read books by Nolan Ryan and Orel Hershiser, why he studied Roger Clemens’s training methods. The throwing motion, Moon said, was like a concert, with so many disparate parts in harmony.Dr. Glenn Fleisig, the research director at the American Sports Medicine Institute, a biomechanics research laboratory, has studied and analyzed such matters, mostly in regard to pitchers but also for quarterbacks. In one study, Fleisig’s team looked at both throwing motions to determine whether it was helpful for high school and college athletes to pitch and play quarterback at the same time. They also studied Texas Rangers pitchers, who threw footballs to warm up.The researchers found the throwing motions largely similar. Quarterbacks held the ball closer to their heads, stood more upright, took shorter strides. The researchers studied what they called “optimal” football mechanics, throws made during drop-backs, not off balance or on the run. They found that both pitchers and quarterbacks planted their feet, rotated their hips and upper trunks, and flipped their shoulders forward, creating a whiplike motion.“It’s the full body, not just the arm,” Fleisig said. “It’s a kinetic chain, a series of coordinated events. The arm is actually the last part of that chain.”Fleisig’s team found that throwing a football was less stressful than throwing a baseball, that it was less harmful to the arm. Still, the research did not support the idea that athletes would benefit from throwing baseballs and footballs during the same season.It did, however, reinforce the notion that a quarterback’s ability to throw far or fast should be defined as arm power, not arm strength. Strength refers more to force. Power is force multiplied by velocity. This is high school physics, translated into the N.F.L.“Quarterbacks need power, which is different than strength,” Fleisig said. “In my business, we see thousands of throwing athletes without their shirts on. They don’t look like muscleheads. They don’t have strength, necessarily. But they have power.”If arm power is not the most important trait in a quarterback, it still factors greatly into how teams design their offenses. A stronger-armed passer allows coordinators more options; they can use more of the field. The passer’s throws are faster but flatter, and they are often harder to haul in.This is evident in the modern N.F.L., which features more downfield passing than when the short passes of the West Coast offense, all that precision and timing, ruled. Last season, three quarterbacks threw for more than 5,000 yards. None did so in 1990 or in 2000.Five quarterbacks tossed more than 30 touchdown passes last season. In 1990, that number was two; in 2000, three.Baltimore in particular is indicative of this trend. The Ravens like to run and run and run and then let Flacco strike deep. He might attempt this six times a game, or eight, or four. But because of the potential for a pass-interference call, which Moon noted was far higher than in his day, and because of the payoff from a long complete pass, such attempts carry a great reward. A weaker-armed quarterback is more limited. So is that quarterback’s offense.As receivers become taller, stronger and faster, as more athletes play quarterback, as fewer teams run the ball as often, as the rules change to favor the offense, “the ability to throw deep,” Moon said, “becomes even more important.”Perhaps the country will see that in the Super Bowl, when Flacco and Kaepernick, two skinny, unimposing men, launch passes in high arcs, or whiz bullets between defenders.Strong arms, those two. Not arm strength."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/sports/baseball/giants-pablo-sandoval-powers-magallanes-to-championship-in-venezuela.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela — The Kung Fu Panda is now a championship series most valuable player in two countries.Three months after winning the World Series M.V.P. award in the United States while leading the San Francisco Giants to a four-game sweep of the Detroit Tigers, Pablo Sandoval did it again Wednesday night, propelling Navegantes del Magallanes to the championship in his native Venezuela.In October, the burly Sandoval hit three home runs in Game 1 for San Francisco, tying a World Series record first set by Babe Ruth. In Venezuela, he hit three home runs for the event, each of them coming at a crucial moment in the seven-game series against the Cardenales de Lara.It was the 11th title for Magallanes in the Venezuelan league, but the first for the team since 2002. Sandoval had planned to play for Magallanes for several weeks this winter. After the team qualified for the championship, the Giants gave him permission to stay — but only for four games.But when the series was tied, 2-2, after those four games, Sandoval said he asked for another extension from the Giants, and got it.“One permission after another,” Sandoval told a television reporter on Wednesday during a wild clubhouse celebration in which ecstatic teammates poured cans of beer on one another. “It was worth it.”In the deciding game, in the Magallanes ballpark in Valencia, Sandoval hit a two-run blast. And Magallanes won the game, 11-9.Venezuelan fans tend to throw cups of beer in the air when their team hits a home run, and there was plenty of beer flying around Wednesday night. There were eight home runs hit in the game.When Sandoval made headlines with his three-homer feat in October, Venezuela’s president, Hugo Chávez, posted a celebratory comment on Twitter.But Chávez has been out of sight since then, having had cancer surgery in Cuba on Dec. 8, and although he is a Magallanes fan, there were no new Twitter messages Wednesday night.Sandoval was ecstatic nonetheless. “This is a dream,” he told the newspaper El Meridiano. “I always wanted to win a title in Venezuela.”Comparing his October triumph with his latest accomplishment, Sandoval said: “It’s not the same. In your own country it’s sweeter.”Magallanes had several major leaguers on its roster besides Sandoval, including Texas shortstop Elvis Andrus. The manager was the former Yankee Luis Sojo.Magallanes advanced to the Caribbean Series in Hermosillo, Mexico, where it will play against the championship teams from winter leagues in the Dominican Republic, Mexico and Puerto Rico.Sandoval will get ready to join the Giants in Arizona for spring training. But he will leave fairly quickly to join the Venezuelan team in the World Baseball Classic. The team, which will begin play in Puerto Rico, has a roster that includes Seattle’s star pitcher, Felix Hernandez; Detroit’s Triple Crown winner, Miguel Cabrera; and Sandoval’s Giants teammate Marco Scutaro."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/sports/soccer/david-beckham-joining-french-soccer-club-paris-st-germain.html,"The next stop on David Beckham’s glamorous and jet-setting soccer career seems like a logical one: Paris.On Thursday, hours after his private plane landed in the French capital, Beckham announced at a news conference that he would join Paris St.-Germain for the rest of the Ligue 1 season. He said he would donate his salary for the five-month deal to a local children’s charity.For Paris St.-Germain, a club whose ambitions have swelled over the past year under the control of a new Qatari ownership group, the signing represents a major public relations coup, if not an actual boost for the team on the field.Beckham, 37, one of the world’s most famous athletes, an Englishman who became a household name for his devastating right foot but also because of his good looks, was chased by several teams around the world. After finishing a six-year commitment with the Los Angeles Galaxy of Major League Soccer in December — he won back-to-back league titles in the last two seasons — he reportedly heard offers from at least one club on every continent where professional soccer is played.“It’s an exciting city — it always has been, and it always will be,” Beckham said of Paris. “But now there’s a club that’s going to have a lot of success over the next 10, 15, 20 years.”Wielding loads of fresh cash, Paris St.-Germain has added star players like Zlatan Ibrahimovic, Thiago Silva and Lucas Moura, as well as the respected coach Carlo Ancelotti. Ligue 1 has long been seen as a second-tier competition in Europe, but the club has looked determined to change that image on its own.Beckham played down his arrival, saying he did not expect to be thrust into a featured role. But Paris St. Germain seemed happy to play him up, decorating the home page of its Web site with a black-and-white photograph of Beckham in a tie and jacket along with a headline proclaiming, “Beckham in Paris.”Beckham, a former captain of England’s national team, has already played for some of the world’s biggest clubs. After rising through the youth system of Manchester United, where he won six league titles, he made a career stop with Real Madrid, where he won one league championship. His stay in Los Angeles included two winter loans to the Italian club A.C. Milan.Fabien Barthez, a former goalkeeper for France’s national team who played with Beckham at Manchester United, said the move was good for French soccer.“It shakes things up,” he told France Info radio. “It’s true that there are some who will always talk,” he went on, referring to criticisms that Beckham represents little more than a grab for publicity. “But we know that music.”Barthez added, “You mustn’t forget what the guy has lived, and all the experience, all this lived experience that he can bring to the young players and the team.”Even as Beckham’s athleticism has deteriorated, he has remained a global star. Wherever he and his family have lived, the attention of soccer fans, journalists and paparazzi has followed. This time, Beckham’s wife, the pop singer turned fashion designer Victoria Beckham, and three sons will remain in London, where the children attend school.Beckham’s stay in Paris, meanwhile, will require some refresher language courses.“I haven’t spoken French for quite a few years, since I was in school,” said Beckham, sending cameras clicking as he flashed his signature smile. “So, yeah, that’s quite a few years. I’m definitely going to have to brush up on it.”But one reporter practically begged Beckham to say a sentence, or even just a word, in French.After a pause, Beckham said, “Bonjour.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/sports/football/owner-steve-bisciotti-builds-ravens-by-building-relationships.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Just inside the front door of the Baltimore Ravens’ chateau-with-shoulder-pads training center hangs an enormous portrait of the former owner who still hovers over the franchise and the city as surely as that oil painting over the big stone fireplace.You have to look much harder, and down a hallway, to find a picture of the current owner, the one whose dollars financed that lavish building, the one who is quietly accompanying the Ravens to the Super Bowl here this week.That man, Steve Bisciotti, 52, is as low-profile as the 8x10 picture of him at a news conference that hangs on an out-of-the-way wall at the Ravens’ facility. Bisciotti declined interview requests in the weeks leading to the Super Bowl, planning to talk to a few reporters only after he arrived here Thursday.So the conversation this week has been much more about whether the man in the oil painting, Art Modell, who took the Browns out of Cleveland and rebranded them the Ravens in Baltimore, will be voted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday than about Bisciotti’s first trip to the game as the primary owner of the team.“I’m O.K. if I’m one of the least-known owners in sports,” Bisciotti was quoted as saying in the Ravens’ biography of him.The last time the Ravens raised the Lombardi Trophy, it was in Modell’s hands in 2001. Only months before, Bisciotti had become a minority owner — Modell needed the infusion of cash to secure free agents for that team — with the promise that he could take majority ownership of the team in a few years. He stood unobtrusively in the back of a locker room in Oakland, Calif., as Modell beamed on national television about going to his first Super Bowl.On Jan. 20, when the Ravens beat the New England Patriots to win the A.F.C. championship, most football fans finally got a glimpse of Bisciotti, the league’s second-youngest owner and perhaps its coolest: tanned; hair slicked back; wearing jeans, an open-collared shirt and a duster coat; gently rubbing the arm of Ray Lewis, who was draped over his back while wearing a Modell T-shirt.“In a very positive way, he is engaged,” said Brian Billick, who was the Ravens’ coach when they won the Super Bowl in 2001, was retained by Bisciotti when he took full ownership of the team and then was fired by him after the 2007 season. “He built his fortune on relationships and is very much about that. It’s not a ‘I’m in charge, do what I say’ mentality. It’s an ‘I don’t care if you’re the ball boy or the head coach, we’ve got to create partnerships here.’ He hires people he trusts and then keeps a purposefully, painfully low profile. He never wants to make it about him.”Bisciotti grew up near Annapolis, Md., going to Orioles and Colts games — where he sat on the 10-yard line — with his older brother and sister and with his father, Bernard. They would sometimes go to the Colts’ training camp, where Bisciotti asked players if he could try on their helmets. In the Ravens’ media guide, there is a picture of a young Bisciotti standing beside Johnny Unitas.Bernard died when Bisciotti was 8, but Bisciotti’s mother, Patricia, is a huge fan of Baltimore sports teams and Notre Dame, and she fed her youngest son’s love of sports, although he played football only briefly in high school.According to a profile in Forbes magazine, Bisciotti spent his high school summers building piers near Baltimore. But at 23, after he graduated from Salisbury State University, he started a staffing firm in a basement with his cousin. It provided temporary employees — engineers — to the aerospace and technology industries.Forbes reported that Bisciotti became obsessed with making enough money by the time he was 35 so his wife and children would not have to work if he, like his father, died young. According to the Ravens, the company he started, now known as the Allegis Group, is the largest privately held staffing firm in the country. Bisciotti is worth around $1.5 billion, according to calculations Forbes made last year.In 2000, Bisciotti purchased a minority stake in the Ravens, then largely stayed hidden, trying to learn from Modell. That, Billick said, eased the transition for Ravens employees who might have been caught in a tense situation. Even after Bisciotti took full control of the team in 2004, Modell was a frequent presence, watching games from a suite at the stadium and practices from a perch on a golf cart.“He treated him with dignity, compassion and made him feel he was still part of the organization,” the Giants owner John Mara said. “A lot of owners would not have handled it the same way. They would have loved to push the guy aside.”Those at the Ravens who have worked with Bisciotti say he has a similar gentle touch with his employees. Billick said Bisciotti would come to the team’s training facility about once a week, but was just as apt to talk with the receptionist as he was with Billick or General Manager Ozzie Newsome. Bisciotti is not active in league matters, sometimes skipping meetings and sending the team president Dick Cass in his place. And he has stepped out of owners’ meetings, shutting the door behind him, to smoke one of his cigars.The former Ravens kicker Matt Stover said he once heard Bisciotti say, “I know I don’t know football, therefore, I hire people who do,” a sentiment that Stover respected. Still, Bisciotti put his stamp on the Ravens when he made the unorthodox decision to hire John Harbaugh, a special-teams coach, to replace Billick. That reflected his real skill: making connections.“He’s got a tremendous ability to have a good feel of people,” said the former Maryland men’s basketball coach Gary Williams, who has been a friend of Bisciotti — a passionate Terrapins fan — for 20 years. “That is a big part of his decision-making. One of Steve’s strengths is his ability to read people. I coached a long time, that’s as important as anything I did: getting a feel for people you’re recruiting, coaches you work with. I just watch that, it’s a big part of his organization.”Bisciotti became a sounding board for Williams when he was coaching, but at basketball games Bisciotti is thoroughly a fan, screaming at officials from courtside. Forbes reported that he shuttles friends to Maryland games on a private jet.“He’s a man’s man,” Billick said. “He’ll go drink for drink, cigar for cigar. You’re going to lose that battle, I promise you.”But it is at Ravens games that the full snapshot of Bisciotti appears. He has attended preseason games in shorts and flip-flops, and his closest friends — many of them from his youth — mingle in his box with his mother and an occasional priest, a reflection of his strong Catholic faith and his support of religious charities.“When you get to Steve’s level of success, he worked really hard, you’re really grateful for how far you’ve come, you’re really grateful for the people who helped you,” said Kevin Plank, a friend of Bisciotti’s and the founder of the Under Armour apparel company, which is based in Baltimore. “There’s that idea of sitting around with four buddies in a treehouse — ‘If you hit the lottery what would you do? I’d buy a team and bring you guys to games, we’d still hang out on weekends.’ You’d say, ‘Yeah, right, you’d change.’“Steve is still the guy who sits up in the treehouse with the guys,” Plank said. “He’d probably be playing pool or darts and taking money off his friends. I speak from experience. Not enough to break you, but just enough to remind you who’s in charge.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/sports/baseball/yankees-near-deal-to-sign-travis-hafner-as-dh.html,"The Yankees apparently found their latest designated hitter Thursday, closing in on a one-year deal with the former Cleveland Indians slugger Travis Hafner. He has agreed to an incentive-laden deal with the Yankees with a base salary close to $2 million.Hafner will replace Raul Ibanez as the left-handed D.H. Ibanez left to join the Seattle Mariners as a free agent. Hafner will have a hard time matching Ibanez’s late-season heroics for the Yankees, but he does have a memorable postseason hit that figures prominently in Yankees lore.On Oct. 5, 2007, Hafner lined a two-out, 11th-inning single off Luis Vizcaino to win Game 2 of the American League division series between the Yankees and the Indians. That game was  interrupted by a swarm of midges that changed the course of that series and indirectly contributed to the Boston Red Sox’ winning their second World Series this century.Thanks in part to the midges, the Indians tied the score off the previously impenetrable Joba Chamberlain in the eighth inning. Hafner’s single three innings later propelled the Indians to a 2-1 victory and a 2-0 lead in a series they would win. But they lost to the Red Sox in the American League Championship Series, and Boston swept the Rockies in the World Series.Hafner, 35, never returned to the postseason, but he had a productive 11-year career, with the Texas Rangers (for one season) and the Indians, hitting 201 home runs in 1,101 games, with an .888 on-base plus slugging percentage. Injuries have limited him the past five seasons; last year, he played in only 66 games because of back and knee problems. He hit .228 with just 20 extra-base hits.But over his career, he has hit .287 against right-handers with a .381 on-base percentage. His O.P.S. against right-handers is .925.The Yankees tried to get Hafner last year in a potential deal that would have sent A. J. Burnett to the Indians. Instead, Burnett was traded to the Pittsburgh Pirates, and Hafner remained in Cleveland. The Indians bought out his contract for $2.75 million after last season, making Hafner a free agent.The Yankees also announced their spring training invitees, including Matt Diaz, Juan Rivera, Dan Johnson, Thomas Neal and Bobby Wilson, all of whom signed minor league deals. They have also invited the minor league outfielders Slade Heathcott and Tyler Austin and catcher Gary Sanchez."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/sports/baseball/baseball-officials-navigate-puzzle-of-anti-aging-clinics.html,"MIAMI — Revive Miami, an anti-aging clinic, was tucked at the end of a hallway on the fourth floor of an office building on a bustling street crowded with restaurants and stores.The clinic’s door was locked this week; the company had apparently shut down. But a business card was wedged against the door. An investigator for Major League Baseball had stopped by, seeking answers.Baseball officials and law enforcement officers are trying to penetrate the often opaque world of anti-aging clinics, which have proliferated in the Miami area in recent years and have become linked to some of the sport’s biggest stars. Anthony Bosch, a former partner of the Revive Miami founders, is at the center of the growing baseball doping scandal.In this region’s teeming medical industry, with businesses offering promises of weight loss, muscle gain and mood enhancement, the clinics can take on a glamorous sheen in their efforts to entice wealthy clients. But that was hardly the case behind the scenes at the clinic where Bosch, 49, treated patients in recent years, according to a business partner.Bosch was a “disaster,” disorganized and unreliable and at times “incoherent,” said Xavier Romero, a former patient of Bosch’s who later invested with Bosch.A newspaper, Miami New Times, reported this week that it had obtained medical records from the clinic Biogenesis of America that linked six major leaguers, including Alex Rodriguez and Melky Cabrera, to the use of banned substances. Biogenesis was run by Bosch.Bosch, through a lawyer, has denied the claims, and several of the players whose names appeared in the article have issued statements denying involvement.The allegations have once again tied baseball to performance-enhancing drugs and left the sport’s officials scrambling. Without more substantial evidence, they are limited in their actions.Romero’s connection to the anti-aging industry began in mid-2011, when a friend recommended he see Dr. Tony Bosch at a clinic called Biokem. Romero, 28, had always been skinny and was trying to bulk up. Soon after seeing Bosch, he began to put on weight, adding about 30 pounds.“He was God to me,” said Romero, who later learned that Bosch was not a licensed doctor. “No one could do that for me, no matter what I ate.”Romero said he was so impressed by the results that he decided to invest with Bosch and his partner Carlos Acevedo, who were interested in expanding. Using capital Romero provided, the three set out to launch Revive Miami L.L.C., which initially shared space with Biokem.It was Bosch’s job, Romero said, to use his contacts to get the prescriptions necessary to fuel the business, although it remains unclear how he obtained chemicals like human growth hormone. However, Romero said he quickly grew uncomfortable with Bosch and his work ethic, and in the spring of 2012, he and Acevedo decided to move Revive Miami to its own offices a few miles away, leaving Bosch behind to launch Biogenesis of America.Romero said that when they parted, Bosch told him, “You are going to come back to me in six months because you failed — because I’m the king.” The two have not spoken since, and both clinics appear to be out of business.Bosch’s lawyer, Susy Ribero-Ayala, declined to respond to Romero’s comments.Hernan Dominguez Jr., who said he was a longtime friend of Bosch’s, said the portrayal of Bosch in the news media was unfair.“Because a businessman fails in various ventures does not make him a failure,” Dominguez said in an electronic message. “Because a man and a woman fail in a marriage doesn’t make them failures. It makes them human. He has a fantastic relationship with his ex-wives and all his children. Public records may be accurate, but they do not reflect a person’s relationship with his friends and family.”Choosing a Different PathBosch grew up in a wealthy Miami neighborhood filled with majestic banyan trees and graduated from one of Miami’s best-known preparatory schools, Christopher Columbus High, an all-boys institution founded by the Marist Brothers, a Catholic organization.Bosch’s father, Pedro Publio Bosch, has been a doctor for more than 36 years. In a statement issued through his lawyer to reporters, he denied involvement with the players mentioned in the Miami New Times article. He did not respond to phone messages seeking comment.Pedro Bosch’s success gave Anthony access to Miami’s well-connected Cuban-American social circle, which has produced many of the city’s power brokers. But Anthony seemed to choose a different path, one that prized quick money and instant gratification, a decision that over the years led him into a spiral of divorces, broken partnerships, businesses gone bust and dishonesty, according to court records and business associates. The latest split came last year, apparently prompting him to launch Biogenesis.Biogenesis is in Coral Gables, across U.S. 1 from the University of Miami, among a group of offices on property that used to be a motel. The swimming pool is still there, as well as old concrete picnic tables. A canal runs along the back.Major League Baseball investigators believe that many of the players never met face to face with Bosch there, receiving substances instead through intermediaries, according to two baseball officials briefed on the matter. The investigators’ suspicions have been stoked in recent days by several denials from players who said they never had direct contact with Bosch.In recent months, the investigators have uncovered evidence that an employee for the player agents Sam and Seth Levinson was one of those intermediaries. Last summer, investigators discovered that the employee, Juan Carlos Nunez, had helped Cabrera hatch a cover-up scheme to avoid being suspended for testing positive for elevated testosterone. Cabrera received a 50-game suspension.Baseball officials believe that the Levinsons knew about the plot, although the players union has cleared them of wrongdoing. After discovering the plot, Major League Baseball began to more closely scrutinize Nunez and the Levinsons. That led investigators to clinics in Florida.Three of the players identified in the Miami New Times article — Cabrera, Gio Gonzalez and Nelson Cruz — were clients of the Levinsons.The two baseball officials said Friday that many of their investigators were trying to learn more about the clinic. “It’s all hands on deck,” one official said.The investigators have sought to talk to Romero and Acevedo, among others, the officials said.When baseball’s investigators began looking into Nunez, the Levinsons and the clinic last summer, they created an improvised war room in the commissioner’s Park Avenue office in New York, where they mapped out a web of people tied to the clinic. Acevedo was among those people, according to one of the officials.A Facebook page linked to Revive Miami said Acevedo was its founder, calling him an “avid health specialist and program director for the hormone therapy treatment.” It continued, “His experience comes from years of research and experience at some of South Florida’s most reputable health and rejuvenation clinics.”Acevedo could not be reached for comment, and the Facebook page is no longer visible to the public.Romero, who said he cut ties with the anti-aging business last year and turned Revive Miami over to Acevedo, said he was surprised to learn of the allegations that Bosch had professional athletes spending thousands of dollars on treatment. He said that such money did not flow back to the business when he was affiliated with Bosch. There had been rumors that Bosch treated such people, he said, but he was not familiar with any baseball players who were patients.“It was a side thing, I guess,” Romero said, referring to Bosch.A Challenging IndustryThe Miami New Times article, which Romero said he read three times, explained that Bosch had notebooks full of patient notes. The newspaper said that it received records from an unnamed former employee of the clinic, and that the records included handwritten notations of drugs that were supposedly given to players. The newspaper displayed some of the records on its Web site, but the documents had not been independently authenticated.Romero said that he was familiar with the notebooks and that the handwriting looked like Bosch’s, adding that it looked almost like “hieroglyphics.” He said he was not privy to the contents of the notes.He said it was hard to believe that an athlete of Rodriguez’s caliber would trust Bosch. “I don’t know how the guy can tie his shoes, let alone have A-Rod as a client,” Romero said.For many reasons, Romero said, the anti-aging business amounted to a losing proposition. Despite the inherent challenges, plenty of people have tried it in recent years. Drive around or search the Web and the number of clinics is obvious, although statistics in Florida are elusive because the centers are not licensed or regulated by the state.“The Florida Department of Health does not license a facility type known as anti-aging clinics, and does not recognize this type of facility in our state,” said Ashley Carr, a spokeswoman with the department.The state does regulate pain management clinics, massage establishments and electrolysis facilities, among other things. Many of the doctors are legitimate.Bosch started a number of failed medical businesses before returning from Belize in 2009 with a degree from the Central America Health Sciences University, according to Miami New Times. He wore a white lab coat with “Dr. Tony Bosch” embroidered on it, the article said, and a medical degree from the university hung on his wall.Many believed he was a medical doctor, including Romero, and by looks alone, he played the part well. He was smart and sounded well informed when he spoke about treatment, Romero said.A growing number of physicians in South Florida are pursuing anti-aging practices full time or dabbling in them.“Part of that is because people are tired of being sick and tired and are looking for something that can help them look better, feel better and have great sex,” said Dr. Mitchell Ghen, who has been practicing anti-aging, or integrative, medicine in South Florida for three decades. Ghen has written several textbooks on the subject for other doctors.It can also be lucrative.Sales of hormones and androgens around the country have jumped in the last five years. In 2011, 5.3 million hormone and androgen drugs were dispensed. In 2007, that number was 2.9 million, according to data from IMS Health, a company that provides market research to the pharmaceutical and health care industries.Florida, which had rampant sales of prescription painkillers through so-called pill mills until a recent crackdown, has also seen a spread of clinics that dole out hormones for unnecessary reasons. In recent years, there have been several high-profile arrests of doctors, pharmacists and clinic operators. The practitioners and clinics were also selling painkillers like oxycodone, turning the establishments into one-stop shops.In most cases, the doctors were complicit in allowing clinics to use their prescription pads to access the drugs. The pharmacists dispensed the drugs without question."

Jamison, who had reached a 20-year, $308 million lease agreement for Jobing.com Arena last year, said he would continue to work toward buying the team and hoped to renegotiate the agreement with Glendale.The league has run the Coyotes for more than three years.“Mr. Jamison will continue to work with the N.H.L. and the city of Glendale to close a deal that will keep the Coyotes in the Valley,” the team’s chief operating officer, Mike Nealy, said in a statement. “Although there is no set timetable, hopefully it will be soon.”BRUINS’ THORNTON OUT The Boston Bruins said forward Shawn Thornton would miss 7 to 10 days because of a concussion.Thornton was injured in a fight Thursday during Boston’s 7-4 loss to the Buffalo Sabres.SUBBAN REJOINS CANADIENS Defenseman P. K. Subban returned to the Montreal Canadiens’ lineup, but it was not clear whether he would play Saturday against Buffalo.Subban missed training camp and the first six games of the season while negotiating a two-year contract. He received a crash course in the new coach Michel Therrien’s system Friday in practice.Montreal’s Max Pacioretty skated for a full practice just six days after an emergency appendectomy."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/sports/soccer/playing-for-tottenham-and-united-states-clint-dempsey-rarely-stands-still.html,"LONDON — For club and country, Clint Dempsey will do what has to be done.His club team, Tottenham Hotspur, is vying for a vital top-four finish in the English Premier League. His United States team is about to begin the final stage of its bid to reach next year’s World Cup in Brazil.As a prominent member of both squads, Dempsey is being tugged from one side of the Atlantic to the other, and then back, and being asked to play a preposterous number of important games in a condensed time period. It is the kind of schedule that would leave the most hardened business traveler exhausted, but the 29-year-old Dempsey, whose toughness has been a constant of his career, is taking it all in stride.After playing in a 1-1 draw against Norwich City on Wednesday, Dempsey could be back on the field on Sunday, when Tottenham plays at West Bromwich Albion. A day later, the midfielder will board a plane to Miami. He will then fly to Honduras with the United States squad for Wednesday’s World Cup qualifying match and fly back to Florida immediately after the game.From there, he will board another plane on Thursday that will land in London early Friday, allowing him just enough time to reorient himself before a lunchtime game on Saturday against Newcastle.That’s four games in 10 days (or five in 14, if you count the F.A. Cup game that Tottenham played last Sunday in Leeds, a non-Premier League contest that Spurs lost, 2-1, with Dempsey scoring his team’s goal).“It is what it is,” Dempsey said in an interview earlier this week at Tottenham’s new $70 million training center on the outskirts of London. “Everybody has to deal with these kind of situations, and all you can do is try to take care of yourself and make sure you’re doing what you can to stay as fit as possible for your next game.”Dempsey’s career has demonstrated that he is not averse to going where he has to go. Even as a child growing up in Nacogdoches, Tex., his parents would drive him to Dallas and back — a six-hour round trip — twice a week for soccer practice.He then joined Furman University in South Carolina — “We didn’t have money put away in the bank for a college fund; soccer was our lottery ticket, our gamble,” he said — before the M.L.S. draft took him to Foxborough, Mass., home of the New England Revolution.In 2007, at the age of 23, he became the most expensive American export to the Premier League when he joined Fulham, a London club with which he played at a high level for a half-dozen seasons, becoming to some extent a one-man ambassador for the capabilities of American soccer.But ultimately, Dempsey wanted a little more. Namely, he wanted to move up from Fulham’s perpetual role as a midlevel English club to a team that would qualify for the Champions League, Europe’s elite club competition and the most prestigious annual tournament in all of soccer.So in effect, he forced his way out in a tough, painful, drawn-out process that bruised some feelings, again demonstrated his inner resolve and landed him at Tottenham, 20 miles away in a different part of London and any number of rungs higher on the Premier League ladder.Dempsey had helped Fulham to its best-ever Premier League finish of seventh place, as well as to the final of the Europa League, sort of a poor man’s Champions League. But Tottenham took him right toward the top.“You always want to play at the highest level possible and make the most of your career, and I felt like I did everything I could,” he said. “I just felt it was time to move.”Tottenham is fourth in the 20-team Premier League, behind Manchester United, Manchester City and Chelsea and ahead of Arsenal, Everton and Liverpool. If Spurs holds on to fourth place, the last spot that gains entry to the Champions League, Dempsey will have played no small part in the achievement.After scoring twice in his first 20 games for his new team, he has six goals in his last eight games, including one in the final moments against Manchester United that tied the game at 1-1 and earned Spurs a key point at home. Back in September, he scored what turned out to be the winning goal in a 3-2 upset at Manchester United’s Old Trafford.“Any point you can get is an important one,” said Dempsey as he talked about the last-second tying goal. “So it was great from a team standpoint and also an individual standpoint of coming up big in a big game.”But as he talked at the Tottenham site, as he pondered Premier League positioning and the improbability of not losing to mighty Man U in either matchup this season, he was also just a week away from stepping on the field for the United States in San Pedro Sula, Honduras.And when he does, he will, along with his fellow midfielder Michael Bradley, be one of the team’s two engines, the players who will be responsible for driving the Americans forward in some sort of cohesive fashion.It is not a new assignment. And now, in his 10th year on the United States roster, Dempsey finds moving between countries, and priorities, as simple as flicking a light switch.“When you’re with whoever you’re with, you give everything you have, so it’s not difficult,” he said.“That’s the way it’s been the whole time I’ve been over here — you have club and you have country,” he said. “All you can focus on is doing your best.”It was while attending matches at the Cotton Bowl during the 1994 World Cup, when he was 11, that Dempsey said he no longer felt like a sporting outsider.“I got to go to some of those games and it was awesome,” he said. “It was where I felt I belonged, because my whole life growing up in Texas I really felt that the game I was interested in, everybody else wasn’t. So I found my niche.”And now?“I see every year as a year where you’ve got to prove yourself,” he added. “And, as an American, you’re trying to be the first American to win the Champions League, the first American team to get to a final of a World Cup.“These are goals you’ve got to shoot for and hope that one day you can get there. It’s a difficult task, but if you don’t have dreams and you don’t work towards it, you’ll never get there. That’s the mentality I have.”And he will have it for four games in 10 days, on two continents."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/sports/baseball/earl-williams-baseball-star-dies-at-64.html,"Earl Williams, a slugging if ambivalent catcher and infielder — “My favorite position is batter,” he once said — who won the National League rookie of the year award in 1971 but whose promise went unfulfilled amid a welter of minor controversies, died early Tuesday at his home in Somerset, N.J. He was 64.The cause was acute myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood, his wife, Linda, said.Playing for the Atlanta Braves in his first two full seasons, Williams hit 61 home runs — including 33 in 1971, his rookie year — and drove in 174 runs, impressive numbers for a player still in his early 20s. He was only the second catcher, after Johnny Bench in 1968, to win the top rookie honor in the National League. (Four others have won the award since, most recently the Giants’ Buster Posey in 2010.)But Williams was traded to the Baltimore Orioles of the American League before the 1973 season, and his career spiraled down so quickly that he was out of the big leagues for good by the time he was 29, an age when many players are entering their prime. Never a hitter for high average, he nonetheless reached double figures in home runs every year of his career on four different teams, averaging nearly 20 a year and hitting 13 in 100 games for the Oakland A’s in 1977.But during spring training in 1978, he was waived by the A’s and not claimed by any other team — a surprising turn, especially to Williams. That June he took the remarkable step of placing a job-seeking advertisement in The New York Times.“Employment wanted by baseball player,” the ad said, adding: “Excellent Health — No Police Record. HAVE BAT — WILL TRAVEL — WILL HUSTLE.”“I don’t understand how I got in this position,” Williams said at the time. “How can I sit on the shelf? How did this happen to me? If you look at my statistics, you’d see I’m a proven hitter.”The ad didn’t work. He never played in the big leagues again.Earl Craig Williams Jr. was born on July 14, 1948, in Newark, and grew up in East Orange and Montclair in New Jersey. His father was a factory worker. His mother, Dolores Reilly, known as Bobbi, served for a time on the Montclair City Council. Earl was a star athlete in high school and spent three years at Ithaca College studying journalism, leaving just short of graduation to play ball. He was drafted by the Milwaukee Braves in 1965. (The franchise moved to Atlanta the next season.)Williams began his minor league career as a pitcher but played mostly at first base and third base. The Braves saw him as a future catcher, and their trouble filling the position led them to rush Williams into action at the major league level. Williams said he never felt comfortable there — in 1972 he had 28 passed balls (though 21 of them came while catching the knuckleballs of Phil Niekro) — and he was not shy about expressing his discontent.The Braves traded Williams to Baltimore, where he butted heads with the Orioles’ equally temperamental manager, Earl Weaver, who died last month. They clashed over Williams’s arriving late for games, resisting catching instruction, yelling at umpires and heckling fans. Still, Williams led the Orioles in home runs in 1973 with 22, but his production fell in 1974, and in 1975 he was shipped back to Atlanta, then sent to the Montreal Expos in 1976. In his last year, on a last-place Oakland team, Williams irritated management by criticizing the coaching staff.Before the trade to the Orioles, Weaver had once said that if he had Earl Williams, the Orioles would win the pennant. Williams later acknowledged that the pressure on him to perform in Baltimore was enormous, and that he felt it especially because he was black. The fans he argued with, he said, were calling him offensive names. Asked by The New York Times in 1981 if race had been a factor in his becoming something of a pariah, he said, “Being a black person has to have an effect on everyone’s career.”In addition to his mother and his wife, the former Linda Montgomery, Williams is survived by a sister, Pamela Reilly; a stepdaughter, Raquel M. West; and a step-granddaughter, Ruqayyah M. Williams.Williams finished his career with a .247 batting average, 138 home runs and 457 runs batted in. He played two years in Mexico before leaving professional baseball for good, after which he worked for more than 20 years as a warehouse supervisor for a cosmetics and pharmaceutical company.After the 1980 season, Williams wrote to 10 major league teams in a failed effort to find a spot on a roster.“Time and experience have certainly taught me that baseball is more than a game of numbers,” he wrote. “But statistics do make an unbiased statement. Why, then, am I out of baseball? I think you know. In a word: controversy.”Controversy “pinned the label ‘undesirable’ on Earl Williams,” he continued.“That label, as baseball labels do,” he wrote, “haunted me to the end of my major league career.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/sports/football/lineman-steve-wright-was-model-for-walter-payton-award.html,"The N.F.L. will present its Walter Payton Man of the Year award on Saturday, an honor that goes to a player who excels on the field and is known for his charitable activities off it.The winner gets a trophy. But it is not of Payton. Instead, it’s of an obscure 6-foot-6-inch, 250-pound offensive tackle who modeled for it when it was originally sculptured in 1969. His name is Steve Wright.“I’m the poster boy for being in the right place at the right time,” Wright, now 70 and a retired salesman living in Augusta, Ga., said in a phone interview.In college, Wright won a national title with Alabama, and he was a member of the Green Bay Packers teams that won the first two Super Bowls under Vince Lombardi.Wright became a minor celebrity in the mid-1970s when he wrote the irreverent memoir “I’d Rather Be Wright,” chronicling his misadventures on and off the field. In its frank assessment of what it was like to be an uncelebrated player on the Packers, the Giants and a handful of other teams, it was seen by some as football’s answer to Jim Bouton’s “Ball Four.”And then there is the award. Johnny Unitas won the first Man of the Year award in 1970. Payton won the award in 1977, and the N.F.L. named it for him after his death in 1999. But the trophy never changed. The sculpture was created in 1969, by the artist Daniel Bennett Schwartz.Schwartz, 83, said the N.F.L. executive David Boss gave him the commission because he was familiar with a Schwartz painting of Jim Brown that appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated and a series of portraits he did of Baltimore Colts players.In response to Boss’s commission, Schwartz sculptured what he called “The Gladiator,” a lineman standing with a cape draped across his shoulders.“I decided to place it in the era that I grew up in,” Schwartz said.He added: “Nobody expected a cape. Capes had been done away with. To me he looked like a Greek soldier or a gladiator.”The N.F.L. approved the concept but wanted the statue to have a bronze tint and the figure to have a more up-to-date look.The league contacted the Giants to send a model to Schwartz’s studio in Manhattan. Wright, who was in the middle of his two-year stint on the Giants, was chosen, though the reason is lost to time.Wright said the pose he took was inspired by a photograph he remembered of his former Packers teammate Forrest Gregg with his face and helmet covered in mud.In his book, Wright wrote: “The award goes to the ‘outstanding citizen-athlete’ in the league every season. The statue is supposed to represent the ideal football player, a composite of every man who ever played, or will ever play, professional football.“Boy, they sure picked a bummer of a guy to pose for it, didn’t they? The guys who won would turn over in their graves if they knew it was me.”He added: “Johnny Unitas, John Hadl, Willie Lanier. They all won a statue of me.”Wright sees football as merely a game and not a way of life. Although he describes his seasons in the league as “the time of his life,” he is not sentimental about his years in the game. In 2011, he auctioned off his ring from Super Bowl I for $73,000.Wright, especially in his book, has little reverence for the game’s icons, including his coach at Alabama, Bear Bryant.“Bryant’s an impressive person until you know him,” Wright wrote. On a visit to the coach’s house, he noticed, “The whole place was covered with nothing but pictures of him.”He went on: “I was surprised there weren’t just plain wall mirrors instead. It would have saved a lot of trouble.”While there are many targets for Wright’s ire in his book, Lombardi is not one of them.“He was a strict disciplinarian,” Wright wrote, “yet he was able to bend enough because he had an end: he wanted to win football games. It didn’t make any difference to him what you looked like, where you came from or what you did in the off-season, just as long as when you walked on that field with a Packer uniform on, you were the best.”Wright, however, had a knack for angering Lombardi. In his book, he includes a passage Lombardi wrote in Look magazine that recounted how the coach, in a fit of anger, hit Wright repeatedly, flailing away at the lineman with his fists during a practice.“What was I doing?” Lombardi wrote in the piece. “Did I hate him, or even dislike him? No, not for a moment. I’m fond of him. He’s one of the most likable men on our squad. That’s his problem. He has all the size and ability to be a great one, but he loves everybody.”Wright credits the coach’s approach with helping him in his successful career selling veterinary pharmaceuticals and insurance after football.“I still operate on Lombardi time,” he said. “I’m always 10 minutes early, no matter where I go.”Wright carries other legacies from his football career every day. He met Sandy, his wife of 38 years, while he was playing. He walks on two prosthetic knees. He still has his Super Bowl II ring.And, of course, both Wright and Schwartz are connected to the N.F.L. through the Man of the Year statue. Schwartz receives a commission from the league for recasting the statue every year.For Wright, the reminders of his stint as a model are unpredictable. He recalled, for instance, watching an interview with the retired quarterback Kurt Warner on television. The camera was in Warner’s living room, and behind him could be seen the Man of the Year trophy Warner won in 2008.“Hey,” Wright remembered saying to himself, “I know who that is.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/sports/football/jim-harbaugh-says-it-all-without-a-word.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Jim Harbaugh can scream when he is silent and pose questions without words. He can say anything without saying anything. His facial expressions are part of his charm, a window into his personality and coaching style, a way for Harbaugh to express the full spectrum of human emotion.His San Francisco 49ers players love to imitate the cartoonish nature of their coach: the clenched teeth, the dropped jaw, the wide eyes, the narrowed brow. Each has their favorite Harbaugh face.Take defensive end Aldon Smith. He leaned backward in his chair and scrunched his forehead as if someone had replaced his Gatorade with swamp water. His eyes bulged. Harbaugh makes this face, Smith said, when he disagrees with a referee, when a player misses an assignment, when an assistant sets him off. It has become his default expression, as omnipresent as his black fleece.“That face is the classic,” Smith said.Those Harbaugh expressions, the most pronounced element of his animated sideline demeanor, will reach an international audience Sunday in Super Bowl XLVII. Fans in China and Europe are in for some theater, a game of football that prompts a game of charades. Harbaugh will smile and mock and rage, appear confused, argue calls, lecture players and applaud touchdowns, and he will do all of this less in the manner of a football coach and more like a one-person play.His parents held a news conference Wednesday in which Harbaugh’s father, Jack, said such “emotion, passion and love” was passed down from his wife, Jackie. Someone asked if she ever instructed her sons — Jim and his brother, John, coach of the Baltimore Ravens and Jim’s Super Bowl coaching counterpart — to tone it down.“No,” she answered.Jack, a longtime coach himself, continued: “We were around Bo Schembechler for a long time, and there were coaches that tried to emulate him. The first time you weren’t yourself, you were exposed and somewhat a fraud. So, always be who you are and don’t follow anyone else.”Jim Harbaugh certainly heeded that advice. His personality is written all over his face.At media day on Tuesday, he sat atop a stage, surrounded by cameras and reporters and comedians and more than a few interviewers dressed in tights. His face registered boredom, happiness and contempt, and sometimes seemingly all three at once. He treated this like any other news conference, with disdain. Someone asked about his brother’s clairvoyant powers, an odd question that brought out the Jim Harbaugh those in San Francisco know best.He leaned forward. His eyebrows arched. If looks could injure, this one would have hurt.“Pardon?” he asked.The question was repeated.“Worried about a lot of things,” he said, dismissively, as his face appeared to fill with annoyance. “I’m not aware of any clairvoyant powers. No.”While entertaining, the many faces of Jim Harbaugh represent more than pure theater, according to experts in the art of facial expression. One is Dr. Dan Hill, a speaker, author and consultant. Years ago, he watched Rafael Nadal in a tennis match and called an upset because “Nadal’s face showed sadness, and he never shows sadness.” Sure enough, Nadal lost.Sports, Hill said, can showcase a full range of emotions, like Phil Jackson’s mock amusement at a blown call, or Bill Cowher’s jaw thrust forward as “if auditioning to be the fifth face on Mount Rushmore.” Hill’s company, Sensory Logic, worked with an N.B.A. team, an N.F.L. team before the draft and a major league baseball team in regard to its pitchers.Then there is Harbaugh.“For a facial coder like me,” Hill said, “he’s kind of a feast.”Harbaugh’s signature expression, Hill said, is when his mouth drops like an elevator toward the turf in surprise. His eyes seem to double in size. He might look angry, might be angry, but he is also conveying to his players that he cares as much as they do about the result. What Hill did not see on Harbaugh’s face was disgust or contempt, the kind readily displayed by Bill Belichick, the famously surly coach of the New England Patriots.“In the simplest terms, Harbaugh’s face says he’s all in,” Hill said. “It shows he’s engaged. None of his players can doubt for a moment that this is a coach who cares. He’s like the Ray Lewis of coaches. His emotion also indicates respect.”Erika Rosenberg, who holds a Ph.D., is an expert in facial expression and emotion who works at the Center for Mind and Brain at the University of California, Davis. She lives in the Bay Area. She cautioned against reading too far into Harbaugh’s expressions but added that “he certainly provides a lot of behavior to consider.”She found Harbaugh “emotionally intense” and “completely under-controlled, which means he doesn’t regulate his behavior to create an impression; it’s raw and more intense.” Sometimes, when he stomped and raised his arms and screamed at referees, he reminded her of a 4-year-old, but not in terms of maturity; more because his behavior suggested he cared little of how others thought he should behave.Rosenberg was particularly drawn to Harbaugh’s eyes. She noticed he lifted his upper eyelid often, which “is not something most people do when they’re walking around in the world.” That happens, she said, when people express anger, or fear, or several other emotions. “But,” she added, “it’s also a form of intense engagement.”Throughout Super Bowl week, Harbaugh’s players imitated and mimicked and described their coach. Their impressions meshed with how Hill and Rosenberg analyzed Harbaugh based on what they noticed about his face.The 49ers returned to the same words: intense, energetic, passionate, unique. Gil Brandt, a longtime N.F.L. executive who knew Harbaugh before he could throw a football, said Harbaugh had always been that way, even as a child.Offensive lineman Joe Staley said: “What you guys see all the time, how he is in front of the cameras, how he is on the football field, that’s how he is with us. He never changes. I love that about him. I love the consistency. I love that he cares.”In an HBO Real Sports segment on the Harbaugh family, Jim described himself as a “Neanderthal type of guy” and joked that John was “probably my only friend growing up.” John then told a story about a girl Jim beaned with a fastball back in Little League.Jim Harbaugh said little after his brother told that story. He made a crack about how she had crowded the plate. His expression, that smile, the eyebrows, the way his eyes danced, seemed to provide more of a window into how he felt. It was an unmistakable expression, in a life filled with unmistakable expressions, with a face that screams joy and screams anger and screams, period.It was another Harbaugh face."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/for-bill-parcells-a-career-with-many-stops-but-one-true-home.html,"Most members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have two or three team logos in their past, but Bill Parcells was elected Saturday with five on his résumé: coach of the Giants, the Patriots, the Jets and the Cowboys before joining the Dolphins as director of football operations.Because of Parcells’ success in leading all five to the playoffs, each of those franchises is entitled to list him as what the Hall of Fame considers a primary contributor to its history, compared with someone who had a brief secondary role.With the Giants, he earned two Super Bowl rings with victories over the Broncos after the 1986 season and the Bills after the 1990 season. His 1996 Patriots team went to the Super Bowl before he departed to the Jets as coach and chief of football operations.At the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., the bronze facial plaque of a player or manager features the cap of his predominant franchise. At the pro football shrine in Canton, Ohio, the bronze bust of each inductee has no helmet, no uniform, no franchise identification.But if Parcells, who has a 183-138-1 record as a coach, could select a logo for his bust, he would surely choose the Giants’ “NY.” Growing up in northern New Jersey, Parcells was a Giants fan going back to when the team played at Yankee Stadium. As a Wichita State linebacker, he was drafted by the Lions and cut, then coached at several colleges before taking over as head coach at Air Force. He moved to the Patriots as an assistant coach, then joined the Giants as a defensive coordinator in 1981 and was named head coach in 1983. His 1986 and 1990 Super Bowl teams established his Hall of Fame credentials well before his travels to the Patriots, the Jets, the Cowboys and the Dolphins.Parcells is the Giants’ 19th primary member of the Hall of Fame along with 9 secondary members. Only three teams have more primary members — the Bears with 27, the Packers with 22 and the Steelers with 20.If asked, Parcells could probably name many, if not most, of the Giants’ primary members. The honor roll includes the owners Tim Mara, who founded the Giants by buying a New York franchise for $500 in 1925, and his son Wellington, who died in 2005 after supervising the franchise for more than six decades. (The other father-son Hall of Fame members are the Steelers’ Art and Dan Rooney).Steve Owen, a two-way tackle on the champion 1927 Giants, who held their opponents to 20 points, a record low for a season, coached the Giants from 1930 to 1953, building a 155-108-17 record with two titles. He was credited with devising the A-formation offense and the umbrella defense.Two of Parcells’ linebackers in Super Bowl victories, Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson, were the most recent Giants inductees.Running back Frank Gifford, defensive back Emlen Tunnell, tackle Roosevelt Brown, defensive end Andy Robustelli, linebacker Sam Huff and quarterback Y. A. Tittle starred on some, if not most, of the Giants teams that won the 1956 championship and five divisional titles from 1958 to 1963.Old-timers will remember the eight-time All-Pro center/linebacker Mel Hein, quarterback Benny Friedman (pro football’s first pure passer), running back/kicker Ken Strong (who came over from the disbanded Staten Island Stapletons), running back Tuffy Leemans and end Red Badgro.The Giants also count Fran Tarkenton and Arnie Weinmeister among their primary Hall of Famers. Tarkenton, obtained in a trade with the Vikings, was the Giants’ quarterback in the often dismal seasons from 1967 to 1971 before returning to Minnesota. Weinmeister was an All-Pro defensive tackle from 1950 to 1953.Among the Giants’ secondary Hall of Famers, those who appeared for a season or two, are fullback Larry Csonka, end Ray Flaherty, running back Joe Guyon, tackle Fats Henry, quarterback Arnie Herber, tackle Cal Hubbard, wide receiver Don Maynard, running back Hugh McElhenny and, surely surprising to some, Jim Thorpe.Yes, that Jim Thorpe, the Sac and Fox American Indian from Oklahoma who put Carlisle (Pa.)

But the Canton shrine does not count assistant coaches on a franchise’s primary or secondary list.As for Parcells, don’t be surprised if, when nobody’s looking during his Aug. 3 induction, he slaps a Giants logo on his bronze bust."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/parcells-is-chosen-for-pro-football-hall-strahan-falls-short.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Bill Parcells, the only coach to lead four teams to the playoffs and the winner of two Super Bowls with the Giants, highlighted a class of seven inductees to the Pro Football Hall of Fame on Saturday.Joined by Larry Allen, Cris Carter, Jonathan Ogden, Warren Sapp and two senior candidates, Parcells will go in without another prominent Giant, Michael Strahan, who failed to make the cut in his first year of eligibility.“It’s just unbelievable,” Parcells said in a phone interview that was played during the presentation. “It’s a great thrill.”The members of the voting committee present at the announcement said Parcells inspired the longest and liveliest debate of the 17 finalists, with the discussion over his candidacy lasting more than one hour.“I don’t think there’s any question that Bill Parcells is a Hall of Fame coach,” said Tom Coughlin, the current Giants coach. “He has Hall of Fame accomplishments throughout his entire career.“Parcells coached for a long time, he worked for a lot of different franchises. It was kind of surprising to me, after the first go-round, I thought, ‘Why isn’t he in?’ ”John Mara, the Giants’ president and chief executive, concurred. “I’m very happy for Bill,” he said. “This is long overdue. He’s one of the best coaches in N.F.L. history.”Parcells, 71, ever the irascible coach, engaged in some repartee with a fellow inductee.“You were one of the finest coaches to ever coach in the N.F.L.,” Ogden, a longtime left tackle for the Baltimore Ravens, said of Parcells. “I want to congratulate you.”“I guess I have a different perspective on you,” Parcells replied. “I always thought you were a pain in the neck.”Ogden and Allen were on the ballot for the first time, and the two low-key offensive linemen seemed happy and relaxed onstage, saying they had not considered their chances all that much and that they were happy to be there.Their casual demeanor served as a sharp contrast to Carter and Sapp, both of whom displayed plenty of dramatics.Carter seemingly had the most cause to be excited because it was his sixth time on the ballot. His enshrinement makes him the first of three high-profile wide receivers — the others are Tim Brown and Andre Reed — to break through after failing to make the Hall in recent years despite excellent statistics.“One of us had to get in,” Carter, the longtime Minnesota Vikings star, said to laughs from everyone on stage. “It’s becoming very difficult to judge the skill of a wide receiver in today’s game. But one thing you can judge them on is the numbers.”In terms of numbers, Carter’s candidacy was hard to argue with. He retired second to Jerry Rice in nearly every receiving category and is still in the top five in receptions and receiving touchdowns.His 13,899 receiving yards are ninth in N.F.L. history.Over the past few years, Carter, Brown and Reed had appeared on the ballot a combined 17 times without getting in. The writers cited the inflation of statistics as the main reason for the struggles of wide receivers in the voting.The fifth modern candidate, Sapp, was his typical boisterous self, but he took time to credit his Tampa Bay Buccaneers teammates, saying that without Derrick Brooks, John Lynch and others, he knew he would not be sitting there.Still, he did take time to congratulate himself as well.“Marshall said it was heaven,” Sapp said his co-worker at the NFL Network, Marshall Faulk, had told him of being elected. “Where’s my wings at? I want to fly.”A larger-than-life personality, Sapp was a dominant defensive tackle for Tampa Bay, helping turn around the fortunes of a moribund franchise while collecting 96.5 sacks. He was named to the N.F.L.’s All-Decade team for both the 1990s and the 2000s, a feat also accomplished by Allen.The two senior candidates, Curley Culp and Dave Robinson, were not part of the broadcast, but their careers were just as impressive as those of the modern candidates. Culp, a defensive star for the Kansas City Chiefs and the Houston Oilers, was a six-time Pro Bowler and was the 1975 defensive player of the year. Robinson, a member of Vince Lombardi’s Green Bay Packers, was a first-team All-N.F.L. player three times and was named to the N.F.L.’s All-Decade team of the 1960s.For Strahan, the only first-time finalist who did not get in, enshrinement will have to wait another year despite the fact that he holds the single-season sacks record and that he led the Giants to one of the biggest upsets in Super Bowl history, the 17-14 defeat of the New England Patriots on Feb. 3, 2008. Also not making the cut were the former owners of both of the franchises set to face off in Sunday’s Super Bowl, with neither Edward DeBartolo Jr. of the San Francisco 49ers nor Art Modell of the Ravens making it in.The seven new Hall of Famers will be officially inducted Aug. 3."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/soccer/us-mens-soccer-team-facing-crucible-of-cup-qualifying.html,"The taut drama of the World Cup can be enjoyed only by teams that emerge from the more rugged slog of regional qualifying, and though the United States is a tournament regular now, having participated in the previous six editions, regarding qualification as a formality still feels like a taboo.This mind-set seems rooted in the idea that advancing through this part of the world is more an endurance trial and psychological crucible than an assessment of pure soccer talent. And so, as the American team begins the final round of qualifiers with a match Wednesday afternoon in Honduras, its wariness toward these types of games has remained.“Those games in Concacaf qualifying are physical battles, full of emotion, social tension,” Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said in a recent interview. He described the approach of the smaller regions as, “We want to show the big team, if it’s Mexico or the U.S., we can compete with them, and we’ll find anything to make their experience as ugly as possible.”Ask players, staff members or journalists who have experienced these qualifying games, and familiar stories emerge: of soul-sapping heat and operatic downpours, of failures of electricity and plumbing, of pocked fields and questionable officiating, of partisan fans hurling insults and objects, and of partisan foreign reporters subverting press box norms. Featuring all this and more, the final Concacaf round will unfold over a period of more than eight months, from Wednesday until Oct. 16. After the six teams play one another, home and away, the top three will earn automatic entry into the World Cup. The region’s fourth-place team will advance to a two-game intercontinental playoff against the winner of the Oceania region.From the individual qualification tournaments around the world, 31 teams will emerge to join the host, Brazil, in the final field. The World Cup will begin June 12, 2014, in São Paulo.Inside Concacaf, the competition on paper appears light. The United States (ranked 28th in the world by FIFA) will face Mexico (15th), Panama (46th), Jamaica (58th), Honduras (59th) and Costa Rica (66th). And for all the talk of unseen dangers and potential missteps, it would be a shock if the United States did not qualify from the group to reach its seventh consecutive World Cup.Understanding the task, Klinsmann has toggled his stance quickly between confidence and caution.He asserted, for instance, that the United States, man for man, was superior to Mexico, its greatest rival. He said his team should approach its game March 26 in Mexico City as one to win, not simply draw. That match, at the uninviting Estadio Azteca, represents the marquee date of the region’s qualifying round. The United States will host Mexico on Sept. 10 at a location to be determined.But Klinsmann spoke, too, about the risk that his players would not have the proper attitude — “a giving approach, a fighting approach,” he called it — entering these games. “It’s more a mental topic,” Klinsmann said of Concacaf qualifying.Klinsmann, not quite a year and a half into his tenure, is still forming impressions of the American player pool. He said some countries had a sense of the core of their squad from the start of a World Cup cycle. Such a characterization, he said, does not apply to the United States. Particularly, he has been looking for players who can step into leadership roles.“Even if you say we will undoubtedly have starters like Michael Bradley or Jermaine Jones or Clint Dempsey or Tim Howard, are those our leaders?” Klinsmann said of what his team would look like next year. “It doesn’t really mean that he will also fulfill that role, he will set the tone, he will give direction or he will lead the group. There might be somebody else that is not on the page yet.”Whether the exclusion of Landon Donovan from the list of stalwarts Klinsmann rattled off the top of his head was intentional or not, Donovan’s involvement with the national team will be one of the more intriguing story lines.Donovan, 30, who has represented the United States at three World Cups, has largely disappeared this winter after saying that he needed an extended break from the game. He was not present last month when the Los Angeles Galaxy opened its training camp.Galaxy Coach Bruce Arena said he was certain Donovan would play for the team this year, but Donovan has made no assurances to the national team, and Klinsmann has not yet been able to integrate him into his plans.For the United States, it will be another factor complicating what appears to be a simple task."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/in-louisianas-river-towns-a-flow-of-nfl-talent.html,"HAHNVILLE, La. — Hahnville High School was surely one of the few teams in the country to hold full-contact spring football practice in January, only two months after the previous season ended. That is not its only distinction.“We might be the only public school in America with a pond full of live alligators on campus,” Coach Lou Valdin said.Alligators slow their metabolic activity in winter, but there is no such torpor with football in southern Louisiana, which has an outsize influence on the N.F.L. relative to the size of the population.The presence of Baltimore safety Ed Reed and the receiver/return specialist Jacoby Jones will provide a 16th consecutive Super Bowl with players from the region. They have hailed from the river towns, cypress swamps, bayous, sugar cane fields and crawfish ponds near Interstate 10 as it follows the Mississippi up from New Orleans to Baton Rouge and then ribbons westward toward Lafayette in the Cajun country.As the 2012 N.F.L. season opened, Louisiana had 61 players in the league — more per capita than any state (though slightly fewer than Washington, D.C.) for the fourth consecutive year, according to USA Football, the national governing body. In settings both urban and rural along the I-10 corridor, football fits seamlessly into an outdoor culture that takes its fun seriously, be it sports, cooking, imbibing, hunting or fishing.“We’ve got kids who can play on the offensive line and put together a motor on a boat blindfolded,” said John Lambert, an assistant at Hahnville High who grew up in West Virginia and sometimes wonders to himself, “Did I just really yell, ‘Leave the alligator alone?’ ”The regional craving for football is fed by a well-organized youth development system, sophisticated and long-term coaching at the high school level and liberal rules that, in effect, allow Louisiana’s prep teams to practice year-round within certain limits.Only 10 other states permit spring practice. The best recruits from this area are ready to play as freshmen in the Southeastern Conference, college football’s best and most demanding league.John Curtis Christian School of suburban New Orleans was voted the 2012 national high school champion in a number of polls. Leonard Fournette, a running back at St. Augustine High in New Orleans, is considered by some the country’s top high school prospect in 2013. Even after the devastation of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, the talent in New Orleans that produced Super Bowl champions like Marshall Faulk and Eli and Peyton Manning remains as plentiful as Mardi Gras beads hanging from oak trees along St. Charles Avenue.“Some of these programs, even the cheerleaders run 4.4,” said Frank Monica, the coach at St. Charles Catholic, which won the Louisiana Class AAA title in 2011.St. Charles Catholic is upriver from New Orleans in a fevered, blue-collar region of cane fields and chemical plants known as the River Parishes. Of the eight high schools in the area, seven have won state football championships. The Ravens’ Reed played at Destrehan High. Corey Webster, a Giants cornerback, played at St. James High. As the quarterback in a no-huddle offense, Webster baffled defenses by calling plays at the line of scrimmage in French, even if his best friend, a running back, usually needed a translation.“He would stand next to me and say, ‘Give it to me in English; I ain’t got that French,’ ” Webster said, laughing, in a telephone interview.The passion at nearby West St. John High is so high that one father demanded his son be benched because he dropped too many passes, Coach Robert Valdez said with a chuckle. The school has 10 coaches for 40 players, not one but two weight rooms and an indoor blocking sled called Big Bertha. The community expects each season that the Rams, who have three state titles and three runner-up trophies, will advance deep into the playoffs, at least until Thanksgiving, preferably until mid-December.“I think every coach in this region that’s part of a successful program understands that this is almost like the SEC,” Valdez said. “You’ve got to win. I know if I’m still playing around Thanksgiving, we don’t have to put the house up for sale. We’re good for another year.”Although West St. John is one of Louisiana’s smallest football-playing high schools, with 210 students in Grades 8-12, the Rams draw as many as 2,500 fans for their biggest games, Valdez said. That means 300 to 500 pounds of fried chicken must be supplied to the concession stand, along with a huge vat of jambalaya.“I can sit comfortably in the pot myself, and I’m 320 pounds,” Valdez said, adding, “Friday night, you’re going to get good food, you’re going to get good football and you potentially are going to watch somebody that you’re going to see on TV on Sunday.”On Friday nights, there are often two games of tackle played in River Parish stadiums — one by the varsity on the field and another by young boys outside the field. It is a ritual followed for decades at these schools, where many family names reappear on rosters year after year.These pickup games are extensions of backyard contests where younger brothers play against older brothers, friends and cousins in an atmosphere that forges something more important than chalkboard technique: toughness, fearlessness and competitiveness.“Today in Pop Warner and Little League, parents want their kids to have fun; when I played in the backyard, if you dropped a ball someone would slap you in back of the head,” said Terry Robiskie, the Atlanta Falcons’ receivers coach, who attended an all-black high school in the River Parishes before becoming one of the first players to integrate Louisiana State in the 1970s. “We weren’t out there to have fun; we were there to win.”In urban neighborhoods, street football rules often call for touch on the pavement, tackle on the grass and no out of bounds. Timeouts are allowed for passing cars. Structured football begins around age 6. One of Faulk’s brothers formed a youth team. Eventually, players are funneled into an extensive system of municipal recreational leagues known as park ball.Junior high schools form tributaries that flow into varsity teams. Hahnville, a six-time state champion from the River Parishes, is fed by two junior highs, each featuring an A team and a B team. Hahnville’s varsity squad dresses 100 players, who are cheered on by 800 season-ticket holders. Four players from the school are currently in the N.F.L., including the brothers LaRon Landry of the Jets and Dawan Landry of the Jacksonville Jaguars. When one player makes it to the league, others grow confident that they can follow.In Louisiana, “you are always one or two players removed from the N.F.L.,” Webster said. “These are guys that come back to the community, somebody you can put your hands on, not just a dream.”Interstate 10 provides recruiters easy access to these football-rich high schools, where players are encouraged to participate in multiple sports to enhance their athleticism. On Thursday, Doc Gamble, an assistant at Kent State in Ohio, visited West St. John, which hopes to have eight players sign scholarships this week. Once, Gamble said, he thought one or two high schools in this fertile crescent of Louisiana were worth recruiting. Now, he said, “it’s like 28 schools.”Football coaches in Louisiana’s public schools can supplement their base teaching salary by 25 or 30 percent. This allows many in this area to have long careers at the same school and keep abreast of the latest trends and techniques. They become mentors and father figures to players, who can be the first in their families to attend college, viewing football as an escape from factory life.“We have to be more than prizefight trainers,” said Rick Gaille, who coached Webster at St. James. “You think of the old black-and-white films. They trained fighters by just having them fight each other. We have to be more than that. We have to be students of the game and teachers of all the components that go into the game.”Louisiana allows 10 days of workouts in pads for high school teams in January or May. A spring game is also now permitted. The rest of this period is used for speed and conditioning work — lifting weights, explosive plyometric jumping, running stadium steps.Many schools also have what is called athletic P.E., which permits spring football activities like passing drills, games of touch football and hitting blocking sleds without equipment. (At Hahnville, even the cheerleaders run and lift weights.) Through the summer, teams often work out four or five days a week, including participation in seven-on-seven passing leagues, before putting on full gear in August.“Basically, we can do whatever we want, as long as we don’t put on pads, all summer long,” said Valdin, the Hahnville coach. This includes taking his players to a weeklong retreat in a remote area of the state where they can train without distraction. “It’s called Camp Living Waters. The kids call it Camp Living Hell.”Curtis Johnson, the Tulane coach who in a previous job recruited Reed to the University of Miami, said he found the New Orleans and River Parish area similar to Miami in its football fanaticism, except for one crucial difference.“I don’t see any betting in Louisiana on Pop Warner games,” Johnson said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/bernard-pierce-ravens-rookie-running-back-is-fitting-in-nicely.html,"NEW ORLEANS — When evaluating game film of prospective Baltimore Ravens, the running backs coach Wilbert Montgomery abides by a singular philosophy.“You have to make me like you,” Montgomery said.Wait. There is an addendum. “You have to make me like you fast.”His time is valuable, so after pressing play, Montgomery needs to see tackles broken and linebackers fooled and yards after contact. He needs to see acceleration and elusiveness and something special. He needs to be given a reason to tell his boss, Ozzie Newsome, that Baltimore must draft this running back even though the Ravens start a Pro Bowler, Ray Rice.This is how the team came to select Bernard Pierce last April, trading up in the third round to take him. In Montgomery’s estimation, Pierce was more explosive in the first 20 yards of runs than any other back he had seen since the two-time rushing champion Edgerrin James, who was drafted in 1999.Like James, Pierce is 6 feet and about 220 sculptured pounds, and the comparisons do not end there. Pierce does not welcome contact as much as invite it, squaring his shoulders to barrel over defenders, then sprint past them. His physical style, with a flourish of speed, serves as an ideal and, perhaps, necessary complement to the slippery, stockier Rice, who understands the value of having a dynamic backup in the current N.F.L. climate.“I don’t have to inflict that kind of pounding on my body when you’ve got a guy who’s 220 pounds or more and coming at you with downhill action,” Rice said, adding: “When you’re spelling yourself, one thing you’re afraid about is, ‘Is the offense going to run the same?’ You have to play the Baltimore Ravens the same when Bernard Pierce comes into the game.”More than half of Pierce’s 135 rushing attempts during the regular season and the playoffs have come since Jim Caldwell replaced Cam Cameron as offensive coordinator. In two of Baltimore’s three postseason victories — against Indianapolis and at New England — Pierce gained more yards, and on fewer carries, than Rice. Pierce’s 6.3 yards per rush ranks first this postseason among running backs.“We liked him a lot,” Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said, “but I don’t think we thought he’d be this good of a player.”Harbaugh is seeing a more evolved version of the player — and the person — who at 16 was sent to Glen Mills, a residential school outside Philadelphia for juveniles referred by courts. Pierce said he was “young and immature” then, with a coterie of troublemaking friends. His role in a brawl at his high school, Lower Merion, landed him at Glen Mills, where students were held to a strict code of conduct.The worst part? “No females,” Pierce said.The acclimation was difficult. He would skip class. He would leave campus. He trusted few. But Pierce bonded with Kevin Owens, his football coach, and Rick Badanjek, the running backs coach. Badanjek encouraged him to join the track team, to start power lifting. Badanjek said he felt, at times, like a surrogate father; Pierce, raised mostly by his mother and his grandmother, rarely saw his birth father, who died in a 2008 car accident. Whenever he flouted the rules, refused to behave, Badanjek would call Pierce’s mother, Tammy, in front of him.“You’re not listening to me; you’ve got to listen somebody,” Badanjek recalled telling him. “It took a long time of me just staying on him, telling him, ‘This is the way it’s got to be, this is the way it’s going to be; it can’t be your way.’ He came to understand that.”Owens said he detected a change in Pierce when he opted to stay for a second year, his senior year, at Glen Mills.“That’s very unusual,” Owens said. “We build a new football team every year.” Pierce’s decision, Owens said, showed he realized how much he had benefited from Glen Mills’s structure.Several colleges recruited Pierce, but none harder, Owens said, than Temple, whose defensive coordinator at the time, Mark D’Onofrio, watched Pierce as often as N.C.A.A. rules allowed. At a county track meet during Pierce’s junior year, D’Onofrio hand-timed his 100-meter dash in 10.6 seconds. D’Onofrio called Al Golden, Temple’s coach at the time, immediately.“For such a big guy, just the way he ran, to see that flat-out breakaway speed on top of everything else that he had was unbelievable,” said D’Onofrio, who is now Golden’s defensive coordinator at the University of Miami. “When you watch his football tape, he was a football player who ran track — not the opposite.”In three seasons at Temple, Pierce rushed for 3,570 yards and 53 touchdowns, and staying close to home allowed him to maintain his relationships with Badanjek and Owens. They communicate every so often now, mostly through text messages, but Badanjek traveled to Baltimore for the Ravens’ game Dec. 2 against Pittsburgh. Pierce said Badanjek rarely praised him, but that night Badanjek told him how proud he was of him.“I said: ‘It’s all coming true for you, isn’t it?’ ” Badanjek said, recounting the conversation. “ ‘It’s all coming together for you. You’re where you want to be. You always claimed you were a man, but you never were. Now you are.’ ”About twice a week, Badanjek speaks with Tammy Pierce. He said he always ends their conversation by asking her to pass along a message to her son: run the way you know. Pierce has in Baltimore, where he made Montgomery — and Rice, and Harbaugh — like him, and fast."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/joe-flacco-will-become-university-of-delawares-second-quarterback-to-start-a-super-bowl.html,"NEW ORLEANS — For all the Heisman Trophy winners and national championships that Ohio State, Texas and Southern California have combined to produce, those marquee football programs have never had one of their quarterbacks start a Super Bowl. The same is true for Oregon, Auburn and a host of other traditional powerhouses.Delaware, however, which competes in the Football Championship Subdivision, has now produced two: Rich Gannon of the Oakland Raiders in Super Bowl XXXVII and Joe Flacco, who will start for Baltimore against San Francisco on Sunday. The only colleges to produce more are Notre Dame, Purdue, California and Alabama, each of which has had three. (Colin Kaepernick, the 49ers’ starter, went to Nevada, and will be that university’s first Super Bowl starter.)Even outside of Super Bowl starts, Delaware, led for years by the Hall of Fame coach Tubby Raymond, has produced an almost staggering number of N.F.L. quarterbacks for a university that does not play in the Football Bowl Subdivision. Including Flacco and Gannon, Delaware has had five quarterbacks drafted by N.F.L. teams, and a sixth, Pat Devlin, signed as an undrafted free agent. While U.S.C. may have had a whopping 21 quarterbacks drafted over the years, Texas, for all its storied history, has had only six.“I think it has a lot to do with being put in a situation with a little more freedom,” Scott Selheimer, Delaware’s sports information director, said of the team’s unusual success. “There’s also a certain amount of luck involved in ending up in the right situation.”The right situation for Flacco was a team that would give him a chance to get on the field. Having initially gone to Pittsburgh, he found himself stuck on the bench with little hope of getting off it.“The bottom line is they had Tyler Palko that year who was the starting quarterback,” Flacco said. “I wasn’t and I just felt like I had the ability.”After redshirting his first year, and then serving one season as Palko’s backup, Flacco initiated the transfer process to Delaware, sitting out a year before he was eligible to play for the Blue Hens.He had reasonable success in his first season with Delaware, but became a star in his second and final season, breaking a number of Blue Hen records, leading the team to the F.C.S. national title game, and attracting enough attention from scouts for him to be selected by Baltimore with the 18th pick of the 2008 draft.Both Selheimer and Flacco speculated that a key to Delaware’s success in quarterback development was finding players who were stuck elsewhere and looking for a place where they could be creative and thrive.“Historically, it’s been a pretty good program for a I-AA school,” Flacco said, referring to the previous name for the F.C.S. “It’s also a pretty good recruiting tool, for a I-AA school to have 22,000 fans show up to every one of your games.”Founded in 1743, Delaware has had plenty of famous alumni, including three signers of the Declaration of Independence and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. But Darelle Riabov, the president of the university’s alumni association and a former Blue Hens cheerleader, thinks the student body will be incredibly excited to see one of their own on football’s biggest stage.“We have 157,000 alumni worldwide and we expect that many of their eyes will be glued to the Super Bowl,” Riabov said. “Flacco is closely followed throughout Delaware and the region. At both Blue Hens and Ravens games, it’s not uncommon to see a mass of UD and Ravens No. 5 jerseys.”After Gannon’s poor showing for Oakland, throwing five interceptions in a loss to Tampa Bay, Blue Hens fans will have to hope that Flacco can do their university proud."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/a-fan-who-knows-how-it-feels-to-win.html,"At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the swimmer Michael Phelps took time out from his pursuit of Mark Spitz’s gold medal record to talk about his N.F.L. fantasy draft. Born and bred in Baltimore, Phelps counts as one of his most cherished mementos from Beijing a Ravens jersey, signed by all the players, which he received early in his race to eight gold medals.Phelps, 27, who retired after last summer’s London Games with 22 Olympic medals for his career, including 18 golds, will be at Super Bowl XLVII on Sunday fulfilling obligations for a sponsor, Visa, and realizing a dream by watching his hometown team play for the Vince Lombardi Trophy.After playing in a pro-am at the Waste Management Phoenix Open on Wednesday in Scottsdale, Ariz., Phelps talked about Ravens football. KAREN CROUSEQ. You’ve attended other Super Bowls in a corporate capacity, but does this one feel special?A. The Super Bowl is one of my favorite sporting events to go to because I love football, but New Orleans is going to be unbelievable. My mother and sisters will be with me, and we will be cheering our hearts out for the Ravens.Q. Whose imminent retirement got bigger play in Baltimore, yours or Ray Lewis’s?A. Probably right now it’s Ray’s just because of everything around him and how the team’s season evolved: him coming off a 10-week injury and leading the team down an amazing road. I’m ecstatic for the team, but especially for Ray. I literally couldn’t be more happy. He has made a very large impact in my life and my career.Q.  Do you remember when you first met him? A. It was way, way back, after the 2000 Olympics. I don’t remember the exact circumstances, just that when we first met I was literally a puny kid and he was a man. Our relationship didn’t grow until 2006, 2007, when I was older and could talk to him on a more adult level, I guess.Q. At the Beijing Olympics, you threw your support behind Joe Flacco, who was just beginning his rookie year as the Ravens quarterback after being drafted 18th over all. Why were you so high on him?A. I had all the faith in the world in Ozzie Newsome and the Ravens’ front office. If Ozzie thought he was the guy, then that was good enough for me.Q. What do you make of his career so far?A. Obviously, Joe has had a tough career in Baltimore. Baltimore fans are very tough. They start to point their finger when things don’t go the way they want. It’s funny. When Peyton Manning became a free agent, I was always joking, “Why don’t we pick up Peyton, and then we’d have two amazing quarterbacks.” I’m glad we didn’t. Joe’s really grown up as a quarterback this year. He stepped up in a lot of pressure situations.Q. Flacco’s first home game, against Minnesota in the preseason, was the night of your eighth and last gold-medal race in Beijing. Your race was shown on the giant video screen at the stadium. Five years later, Flacco is in the Super Bowl, and you’re retired. What’s that like to contemplate? A. It is kind of a lot to think about. It’s kind of cool. I still remember looking at pictures taken at the stadium that night when the Ravens showed my race, and the signs that some of the fans were holding up. I love my hometown and my hometown football team."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/super-bowl-xlvii-49ers-innovative-pistol-offense-keeps-defenses-guessing.html,"NEW ORLEANS — At bottom, football is math. A brutal, ruthless form of it, but math. The offense schemes to gain an advantage — more blockers than defenders — while the defense plots to foil those plans.Which is why sometime during the Super Bowl on Sunday, San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick will line up four yards behind center, a running back directly behind him, and receive the snap. He will shove the ball into the running back’s stomach and, from there, do one of three things: hand the ball off, fake and run outside, or prime for a play-action pass.All of these options are appealing to the 49ers. None of them, in sum, are appealing to their opponents. It is a hellacious challenge, defending this Pistol formation, operated by this San Francisco team, with its speedy quarterback and its read-option tendencies and its general proficiency at scoring a lot of points and gaining a lot of yards.“You name it, we got it,” the offensive coordinator Greg Roman said. “We’re like the diner.”In the last two playoff rounds, Green Bay and Atlanta pored over the 49ers’ menu but could not eat. The choices overwhelmed them. The Baltimore Ravens, next up, found a corner booth and have yet to leave. After flummoxing Peyton Manning and Tom Brady, the Ravens have spent the last two weeks practicing and preparing, honing instincts and concocting strategy, steadfast in their belief that for all of San Francisco’s success with the Pistol — and despite the near-mythical status it has attained recently — it is hardly unstoppable.“Like every offense, it has its strengths and its weaknesses,” said the former Nevada coach Chris Ault, who conceived the Pistol in 2005.One of its prevailing strengths is that the placement of the running back — in a neutral position, not beside the quarterback — prevents defenses from gleaning presnap clues. When defending the read-option, teams generally seek to thwart the dive (the handoff up the middle) first, then the quarterback, then the potential pitchman. Dean Pees, the Ravens’ defensive coordinator, has preached the importance of discipline to his players, who, he said, will have specific instructions and assignments: someone focuses on Kaepernick, someone else keys on the inside run.By its nature, Pees said, the Pistol will put the most stress on Baltimore’s outside defenders, intentionally left unblocked at the line of scrimmage. The defenders — likely the linebackers Terrell Suggs and Courtney Upshaw — will determine how Kaepernick proceeds by their immediate reaction at the snap. If the linebacker stays put, Kaepernick hands the ball off or runs play-action. If he funnels inside, Kaepernick sprints around the end.“If you watch the film, you can tell that a lot of people who played against the read-option just played as individuals,” Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis said. “It’s really hard to play that type of package as individuals. You have to play it as a group.”The Ravens gathered such intelligence on Dec. 9 in an overtime loss to Robert Griffin III and the Redskins, who also use the Pistol. Griffin’s speed surprised the Ravens; it took them the first quarter to get acclimated, said Pees, who called their performance on Washington’s first two drives “about as bad as it possibly could have been.” Lewis, along with the other starting inside linebacker, Dannell Ellerbe, missed that game because of injury, but he will be critical on Sunday in limiting running back Frank Gore’s effectiveness.Warren Sapp, the former defensive tackle, said that stopping Gore is more important than stopping Kaepernick, a sentiment echoed by his colleague at NFL Network, the former cornerback Eric Davis. Explaining his reasoning, Davis noted that the 49ers, after falling behind by 17 points in the N.F.C. championship game against Atlanta, never abandoned their running game.“You take Frank Gore away, you take away the running aspect of the Pistol,” Davis said. He added that he expected to see the Ravens call an aggressive series of slants, stunts and blitzes on Sunday. Of Kaepernick, Davis said, “You make him throw the ball.”That was a popular approach during Kaepernick’s early years under Ault at Nevada. In October 2007, he was an unknown commodity — unknown, at least, to Boise State, which had prepared for a different quarterback heading into its game against Nevada. The Broncos won, 69-67, in four overtimes, despite a brilliant game by Kaepernick, who rushed for 187 yards, averaging 6 yards per carry, and accounted for 430 yards of offense.“We tried to play traditional defense,” said Justin Wilcox, Boise State’s defensive coordinator at the time, “and he absolutely ripped us.”With more than a year to adjust, Wilcox devised a plan — a plan that other teams would soon adapt and adopt. In Boise State’s next game against Nevada, Wilcox involved a safety in run support and put his cornerbacks almost exclusively in one-on-one coverage. The linebackers, in passing situations, dropped back into a zone. Sometimes, Wilcox aimed to bait Kaepernick with defensive fronts that would dictate whether he would run with the ball — “because he was so fast, we tried to make him run laterally” — or hand it off. The coverage was aimed to entice Kaepernick, not yet a polished passer, into throwing. Boise State won again, this time limiting Kaepernick to 38 percent passing (19 of 50) and 70 yards rushing, on 4.4 yards a carry.“How do you make the offense play left-handed? How do you make them do something that they don’t want to do?” said Wilcox, now the defensive coordinator at Washington. “That’s always the goal. But it’s never easy. Teams adjust.”And Nevada did. Several teams attempted to counteract the Pistol by isolating receivers in man-to-man coverage, sending one safety deep and another into the slot to assist in run defense or defend passing routes underneath. But when defenses sought to negate Kaepernick, Nevada gave the ball to its backs.“We always taught Kap that the running back is paid to run the football, he’s the guy we want to give it to,” Ault said. “The good teams we played against, instead of trying to defend the whole world, they would force Kap to hand the ball off inside to their linebackers and big defensive tackles and see if they could hold up from there. But you keep feeding that back, eventually there’s going to be a mistake, and that’s when he goes.”Those mistakes did come in San Francisco’s victory against Green Bay, when the Packers overpursued on the fake inside, and Kaepernick shredded them for 181 yards. The Falcons, after watching that performance, were intent on neutralizing him, so they deployed a strategy that ultimately backfired. By sending the edge defender at Kaepernick, Atlanta did deter him from running: he had two carries for only 21 yards. But Kaepernick, ever patient, reacted by handing off to Gore and LaMichael James, who feasted on the interior space by combining for 124 yards and 3 touchdowns.Such is the beauty of the Pistol and the problem for the Ravens: when one option vanishes, another appears.“Just because you have a schematic that works on a grease board doesn’t mean you’re going to stop the guy,” Wilcox said. “You have to have the guy there to tackle him, and Kaepernick’s the fastest guy on the field. Even when you’re right, you might be wrong, you know?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/hockey/ice-hockey-at-soldier-field-its-like-youre-a-kid-again.html,"CHICAGO — The weather was picturesque for hockey at Soldier Field on Friday. Snow fell on a clear and cold winter night on the shore of Lake Michigan. The rest of the scene was less conventional. Two teams made up of adult recreational league players, some who only recently learned the sport, skated before more than 60,000 empty seats.With ice laid over the Soldier Field turf for the first time in at least 60 years, in preparation for a college hockey doubleheader on Feb. 17, the Chicago Outdoor Hockey League helped to begin more than two weeks of hockey festivities. Friday night’s hockey game was thought to have been the first played at Soldier Field, according to the organizers of the event.“It’s a surreal feeling,” said Tom Walsh, 30, who took up the sport two years ago and skated Friday. “I think I’m a little embarrassed that some of us are playing this special game, given our skill. We’re lucky to be here.”Friday’s honor is the highlight of the brief existence of the C.O.H.L., a unisex adult hockey league that caters to players and novices of all skill levels. Sean Campbell founded the league last winter as a way to bring the thrill of pond hockey he played in his youth to adults around Chicago.“The open air and the open atmosphere is an entirely different feel,” Campbell said. “It’s like you can breathe more. It’s like you’re a kid again.”Campbell, a 35-year-old Chicago native who works in information technology, created an online resource for pickup hockey games after the Blackhawks won the Stanley Cup in 2010. He said interest in hockey had been on the rise since, and when he found out two new outdoor rinks were opening last winter, he started the league.A year ago, the league had 16 teams and 200 players. This year, it expanded to 26 teams and 368 players. Participants range from 18 to 68. There are also now 12 women, up from 6 a year ago.“They don’t treat me any different,” said Mary Mycyk, 37, and a participant in Friday’s game. “And if they ever did run me into the boards, my teammates would be looking out for me.”To participate in Friday’s game, players were voted in by their peers, and all skill levels were represented. Each team had four lines, carefully selected to keep the action fair and competitive.The game followed an opening ceremony for the rink and a Chicago Blackhawks charity event, and did not begin until after 10 p.m. Temperatures hovered just above single digits. Players’ friends and families watched from metal benches next to the rink, bundled in sleeping bags and extra layers, and they held mugs of hot chocolate in their hands, giving the evening a quaint, small-town feel, even as the stadium rose around the ice with the lights from the downtown skyline beyond.“This is totally awesome,” Mycyk said. “I’ve been a Bears fan all my life, came to a lot of games as a kid, so it doesn’t get much better than this.”By the end of the night, the game yielded nine goals, countless smiles and one jealous Hall of Famer.“I would have loved to play here,” said Tony Esposito, the former Blackhawks goalie who played in the N.H.L. from 1968-84. “If you would have said 20 years ago that you’d have people skating around at Soldier Field, they would have said you were crazy.”"

Gallacher (1-under 71) led Sterne by three shots to begin the day but bogeyed the first two holes while Sterne (71) birdied the second.¶ Karrie Webb won her eighth Australian Ladies Masters title, coming from two strokes behind in the final round with birdies on three of her last five holes for a five-under 67 at Gold Coast.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/super-bowl-joe-flaccos-precision-typical-of-elite-quarterbacks.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Neither of Joe Flacco’s two brothers was on the field in the Super Bowl on Sunday night. Flacco, the Baltimore Ravens’ quarterback, was not part of any pregame controversies involving deer antler spray, and he did not turn this game into a much-publicized finale of his retirement tour. At this point, there is no such thing as Flacco-ing.So yes, most of the Super Bowl’s story lines had little to do with Flacco. But this was nothing new for Flacco, who, despite his own professions of self-confidence, has rarely been seen as a member of the N.F.L.’s coterie of top quarterbacks.After the Ravens’ victory over San Francisco, however, the facts can no longer be ignored: at 28, Flacco now has the same number of postseason wins (nine) and Super Bowl titles (one) as Peyton Manning, who happens to be one of the three explosive quarterbacks that Flacco outplayed during the Ravens’ magical run to their franchise’s second Super Bowl championship.First, Flacco beat Manning on a bitterly cold day in Denver. Then he knocked off New England’s Tom Brady on the road two weeks ago in the A.F.C. championship game. Finally, after taking down two icons, Flacco beat the wunderkind Colin Kaepernick, whose read-option versatility may well be the wave of the future but was not the style of the moment here Sunday night.Quite simply, Flacco was better: he completed 22 of 33 passes for 287 yards and 3 touchdowns and, perhaps most important, did not throw an interception. Flacco, whose contract expires after this season, was named the game’s most valuable player in what might be the best start to a player’s free agency in the history of professional sports.“Joe was phenomenal,” Ravens Coach John Harbaugh said. “He’s got the guts of a burglar. He was doing it all night making plays.”Last April, Flacco was almost universally mocked when he said he did not think he was among the top five quarterbacks in the league, but rather, that he was the best quarterback of all, better than Brady and Manning and Green Bay’s Aaron Rodgers. “I don’t think I’d be very successful at my job if I didn’t feel that way,” he said.Now, the sentiment does not seem so absurd. Flacco made every kind of throw on Sunday, from in-the-pocket strikes to on-the-run heaves. There was the 30-yard pass to Anquan Boldin in the first quarter where Flacco slipped out of San Francisco linebacker Aldon Smith’s flailing grasp. There was the 56-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones in the second quarter in which Flacco flung the ball 50 yards in the air.Then there was, finally, the critical fourth-quarter third-and-1 completion to Boldin on a perfect back-shoulder throw that moved the Ravens into position for their final field goal.“I don’t think it’s going to settle in for a while,” Flacco said afterward. “We’ll have this thing forever.”When it was over, and the Ravens poured out on to the field, Flacco’s typically understated personality was on display. While linebacker Ray Lewis and safety Ed Reed pranced and preened, sprinting up and down the field, Flacco stayed mostly low-key. He exchanged a few hugs and high-fives and embraced the Ravens’ owner, Steve Bisciotti.In a rare moment of candor for him, television cameras appeared to catch Flacco utter an exuberant expletive, but otherwise he was mostly at ease.Of course, this is Flacco’s style. He generally deals in platitudes and bromides, leaving the visible signs of leadership to other players. Before the game, Lewis was the one in the middle of the Ravens’ huddle, shrieking and swaying, whipping his teammates into a frenzied lather.After the game, too, Flacco seemed content to stay in the background. When the Ravens gathered on the stage for the presentation of the Vince Lombardi Trophy, Jim Nantz of CBS had to call Flacco up to the front for the typical interview with the game’s M.V.P. and, after giving a short answer to one question, Flacco again made way for Lewis to step up to the microphone.“It’s just who I am,” Flacco said of his personality. “I don’t really know if your demeanor off the field impacts that but it may.”Certainly it did not hurt Flacco, who thrived during a season in which he saw negotiations on a new contract break down and had to adapt to a new offensive coordinator after Harbaugh fired Cam Cameron and moved Jim Caldwell into the play-calling role in December. Then, on Sunday, he did not allow the Ravens to break after a power failure seemed to spark the 49ers to a late-game rally.Unruffled, Flacco shone when it mattered most. He did not throw an interception in the postseason (his last one was on Dec. 16) and he threw 11 touchdown passes in the Ravens’ four playoff wins.“The moment doesn’t get too big,” Flacco said. “We are comfortable. We’ve been there before. We’ve failed before. We’ve succeeded before. We are not worried about the outcome. We just go out there and play football, execute and we believe that if we do that, and do that to our ability, then eventually it is going to work out.”Is he the best quarterback in the league? Some will surely continue to say no. But it is impossible to deny what Flacco accomplished this season. And even though history may remember Sunday as Lewis’s last ride or the Harbaugh brothers’ reunion, it may also have been the true beginning of Flacco’s legacy."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/super-bowl-for-jacoby-jones-trip-home-and-2-trips-into-end-zone.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Jacoby Jones is not the most notable native Louisianian on the Baltimore Ravens; that would be safety Ed Reed. He is also not the Ravens player best known for on-field dancing; that honor goes to the retiring linebacker Ray Lewis.On Sunday, though, as the Ravens beat the San Francisco 49ers, 34-31, in the Super Bowl, Jones starred in his home city and shimmied with a rhythm that surely made Lewis proud. Jones caught one touchdown pass and returned a kickoff 108 yards for another, setting an N.F.L. postseason record, in providing the most explosive moments of the Ravens’ victory.In a prescient moment, Jones warned the 49ers early in the week not to give him an opportunity in the return game.“If I were them, I wouldn’t kick it to me, not at all,” he told reporters. But San Francisco kicker David Akers apparently did not get the news. On the opening kickoff of the second half, Akers blasted the ball deep into the Ravens’ end zone, and Jones, eschewing a touchback, brought the ball out.There was little subtlety to his path. He essentially went right up the middle, sprinkling in a few sidesteps but mostly sprinting straight ahead as if he were on an interstate highway. Once he got past Akers, there was little hope for the 49ers to catch him, and he swayed in the end zone, doing a version of Lewis’s dance, known as the Squirrel.How did it feel for Jones? “Like a million dollars,” he said afterward. “I saw daylight because of my blockers.”It was the first kickoff return for a touchdown in the Super Bowl since Devin Hester ran one back for Chicago in 2007. During the buildup to the Super Bowl, Jones said he recalled watching Hester’s run and had thought of doing the same thing “hundreds of times.”He added: “On returns that go for a touchdown, they happen when you least expect it. In games like this we just want to work for good drive starts and field position. So if one pops open, that’s a blessing.”Jones also took advantage of an opening in the 49ers’ secondary in the second quarter, slipping behind Chris Culliver and pulling in a pass that quarterback Joe Flacco heaved some 50 yards in the air. Jones, who also caught the critical 70-yard late-game touchdown pass that allowed the Ravens to force overtime against Denver in the divisional round, pulled in Flacco’s floater as he fell to the ground just inside the 10.That would have been an important gain if the play stopped there, but Jones realized that Culliver had not touched him. Jones jumped to his feet and dashed into the end zone.“He had a little space, went up and made a great catch,” Flacco said. “He was a beast out there.”Jones’s performance was an upbeat conclusion to an experience that began with a return home. Jones grew up in New Orleans East and attended Abramson High School, but his family’s house and his high school were destroyed in Hurricane Katrina. Still, Jones’s mother remained in New Orleans, and she cooked dinner for Jones and several of his teammates last Monday.Gumbo, jambalaya, macaroni and potato salad were among the items on the menu, Jones said, and the feast was the perfect way to begin a week that Jones, who was cut after five seasons with Houston and signed with the Ravens last May, had imagined for some time.“I can’t explain it,” he said amid the celebration afterward. “We got the W. I got the W at home, and, Monday morning, I’m headed to my second home, which is Baltimore, and bringing that win.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/power-outage-in-superdome-delays-super-bowl.html,"NEW ORLEANS — It was not New Orleans’s brightest moment. About 90 seconds into the second half of Sunday’s Super Bowl, the lights on one half of the Superdome’s roof suddenly went out. Internet connections in the press box were cut, and the scoreboards went dark.After the sudden break in the action, many of the 71,024 fans started murmuring. The public-address announcer made several muffled statements about the power failure. Strangely, the cheerleaders for the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens continued to shake their pompoms.The roughly 35-minute power failure, which came just moments after the Ravens’ Jacoby Jones returned the second-half kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown, was one of the oddest moments in Super Bowl history.In choosing New Orleans to host the game, the N.F.L. wanted to signal that the city was back in business after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The Superdome, which was turned into an emergency shelter after the storm, had been overhauled and rebranded through to a sponsorship deal with Mercedes-Benz.The blackout is certain to add to the legend of the Superdome. Some New Orleans residents believe the building is cursed because it was built near the old Girod Street Cemetery, which had fallen into disrepair. Some Saints fans believe this is why their team was unsuccessful for so long.Either way, the N.F.L., which runs the Super Bowl with an iron hand and brutal efficiency, is not used to random events during games, which are tightly scripted for television networks and the hundreds of millions of viewers at home. Two years ago, hundreds of fans were denied entry to the game in Arlington, Tex., because temporary stands were not safe. Weather has been unpredictable over the years, but rarely are games delayed for anything more than the occasional hiccup.Michael Burns, a spokesman for Entergy Services, the local utility, said that his company’s distribution and transmission feeders that serve the Superdome were never interrupted. Power did not go out elsewhere in the city.CBS, which broadcast the game, said in a statement that it had “lost numerous cameras and some audio powered by sources in the Superdome.” The network switched to backup power and remained on the air. CBS said it would honor all its commercial commitments.Entergy and SMG, the company that manages the Superdome, issued a joint statement explaining the power loss:“A piece of equipment that is designed to monitor electrical load sensed an abnormality in the system. Once the issue was detected, the sensing equipment operated as designed and opened a breaker, causing power to be partially cut to the Superdome in order to isolate the issue. Backup generators kicked in immediately as designed.“Entergy and SMG subsequently coordinated start-up procedures, ensuring that full power was safely restored to the Superdome. The fault-sensing equipment activated where the Superdome equipment intersects with Entergy’s feed into the facility. There were no additional issues detected. Entergy and SMG will continue to investigate the root cause of the abnormality.”The power failure immediately spawned an Internet frenzy. Bobby Hebert, a former Saints quarterback, called the game the Power Outage Bowl on Twitter. One enterprising fan created the hashtag, SuperBowlBlackOut, on Twitter.Patrick Rishe, a columnist for Forbes, said the blackout would hurt New Orleans’s chances of hosting another Super Bowl, although Mayor Mitch Landrieu quickly engaged in a bit of damage control, issuing a statement.“The power outage was an unfortunate moment in what has been an otherwise shining Super Bowl week for the City of New Orleans,” Landrieu’s statement said “In the coming days, I expect a full after action report from all parties involved. For us, the Super Bowl isn’t over until the last visitor leaves town, so we’re focused on continuing to show our visitors a good time.”Indicative of the lopsided score at the time — the Ravens were ahead, 28-6, when the lights went out — the Ravens’ sideline remained bathed in light while the 49ers were in the shadows.In the Superdome, the unexpected blackout led to several quick decisions. The players could have gone to their locker rooms, but they chose to stay on the field. Many of them stretched on the ground and tossed footballs to stay limber. A few looked as if they were relaxing on a park lawn.“It was the first time I had to stretch in the dark with my teammates,” Bernard Pollard of the Ravens joked. His teammate Cary Williams said with a smile that he thought Beyoncé, who sang at halftime, “blew out the power.”Confused fans who had been watching the 49ers try to forge a comeback started doing the wave. A number of them started screaming for the players to start playing again. As each bank of lights popped back on, the players put their helmets back on and worked out in earnest. The crowd roared as the stadium gradually brightened, and the air conditioning started blowing again, too.“I just alerted them of the time and to stay loose, and our spark would come and we wouldn’t look back,” said Jim Harbaugh, the 49ers’ coach, recounting what he told his team during the delay.The break in the action may have been just what the 49ers needed. After the lights came back on, they scored 17 straight points.After 35 minutes in the dark, a game in danger of turning into a blowout had suddenly been given a jolt."

McManus could have told them to be bolder, to tell us what we didn’t see, to make us take notice.While praising the offense of the Baltimore Ravens, who led, 21-6, at halftime, they were not nailing what was wrong with the San Francisco 49ers’ defense.Were the 49ers missing assignments or missing tackles? Was the Ravens’ game plan simply so much better?Was Coach John — as Simms and Nantz insisted on calling him — outcoaching Coach Jim?Why, after 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver was burned for a touchdown by Jacoby Jones, did neither announcer mention that last week he had to apologize for making antigay comments?Why, with so much hype about Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis playing his final game after 17 years, did they pay so little attention to what he was doing (or not doing) on the field?Lewis, that most ubiquitous of men, was rediscovered in the fourth quarter, with a statistic (four tackles) and a discussion of the murder charges against him that were dropped in 2000 and his polarizing personality. That’s a long time not to notice someone so integral to the Ravens.But Justin and Aldon Smith, two of the 49ers’ defensive stars, stayed missing.Why did Simms flat-out say that he wouldn’t second-guess Baltimore Coach John Harbaugh’s risky decision to call a fake field goal, which failed to yield a first down? Second-guessing is Simms’s job. More important, he should be first-guessing.The second half began with Jones’s 108-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and a blackout at the Superdome that gave CBS a chance to replay, ad nauseam, the makeout session between the supermodel Bar Refaeli and the curly-haired nerd in a GoDaddy.com ad.But it went to commentary from its on-field studio crew in the dim light.Without a game to televise, James Brown, CBS’s studio host, and the sideline reporters Steve Tasker and Solomon Wilcots competed to tell viewers how long — 15 minutes? 20 minutes? “any moment”? — before the game could resume.The delay, and the Ravens’ 28-6 lead, conspired against keeping the audience, and approaching viewership records.(Through the end of the game, Simms and Nantz made no issue out of the failure of an N.F.L. official to appear on the sideline to explain the blackout to Tasker or Wilcots. Even without a full explanation, the N.F.L. should have provided someone to tell CBS what it knew.)Once the game resumed, Simms did not seem to draw inspiration from Beyoncé or studying highlights in the dark. He offered a trite truism about the 49ers, who were trailing badly: “When you’re down, you have to make great catches.”Simms then added this tortured analysis: “One thing I’ve taken out of this game, and really all through the playoffs, is if you watch it, the number of big plays in the games are because the quarterbacks are throwing the football.” (Yes, yes!) Arm strength, he emphasized, is important.Then, after the 49ers had amassed 105 post-blackout yards and 14 points, to the Ravens’ 15 yards, Simms said that the power failure had not hurt the Ravens but that it had helped the 49ers.That just sounded wrong.Later, he would all but refute his analysis when he said that the Ravens might have been thinking that they were close to winning the Super Bowl — a reason to play as if stuck in neutral.At the Super Bowl, a network’s announcers and production crew should be in sync. But when Simms praised how little effort 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick expended on a hot, sharp pass, there was no replay to show that easy delivery.Simms sounded out of sorts. He said that the Ravens came after Kaepernick with a “bunch group,” but did not say which defenders they were or if that was some sort of strategy.And with a fourth-and-goal for the 49ers at the Ravens’ 5 and 1 minute 50 seconds left, Simms did not venture a guess about the type of play that San Francisco should call, and he did not interrupt Nantz when he saw the defense the Ravens were setting up, which he said he detected afterward.He also delayed taking note, for too long, the contact made by the Ravens’ secondary against 49ers receivers in the end zone on Kaepernick’s incomplete pass.The game, which promised a great finale for much of the fourth quarter, ended without much of a bang — although one of CBS’s strong on-field microphones picked up Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco’s exuberant expletive, which he followed with the word “awesome.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/with-a-son-on-each-sideline-the-harbaughs-remain-neutral-to-the-end.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Two days before Thanksgiving in 2011, Jack Harbaugh received an unsolicited phone call from Archie Manning. Harbaugh’s sons, Jim and John, were about to face each other as coaches of the San Francisco 49ers and the Baltimore Ravens. Over the years, Manning had watched two of his sons, Peyton and Eli, battle each other and he wanted to sympathize.Archie said that because both his sons were quarterbacks, he simply rooted for whichever team was on offense when the Colts played the Giants. Harbaugh’s sons, on the other hand, were coaches, which made it harder for Jack and his wife, Jackie, to remain neutral.“He said, ‘I can’t imagine how it’s going to be for you and Jackie when the head coaches are in charge of the game on both sides,’ ” Jack recalled Archie saying that day before Archie offered some advice. “ ‘I promise you it will be over on Friday,’ and sure enough it was great advice and that’s exactly how it happened.”Jack and Jackie kept Manning’s words in mind in the frenzy leading up to and after Sunday’s Super Bowl, in which John’s Ravens beat Jim’s 49ers, 34-31.“I knew it was going to be a hard-fought game, very, very competitive,” Jack said as he stood to the side of the podium while John spoke after the game. “I’m so proud of John; we talked about how he started at Western Michigan University as a graduate assistant, and then to stand on this stage with the ultimate prize, I’m so proud of him and I’m so proud of Jim. I knew he was going to fight back and he did and made it a great football game, maybe one of the greatest in Super Bowl history.”During the week before the game, Jack and Jackie were on their own whirlwind tour, paraded from news event to news event to answer what amounted to two basic questions: What did it feel like to have their sons go head to head? Did they favor one over another?Relentlessly upbeat parents, the Harbaughs answered the first question with giddy aplomb. As they have done hundreds of times, they asked crowds, “Who has it better than us?” before they yelled, “Nobody!” They steered well clear of answering the second question. They declined to say where they would be sitting during the game and said they would not wear Ravens or 49ers team colors on Sunday. They claimed not to have talked about football with their sons last week and declined to describe the differences in their personalities.“Well, we are neutral in this situation,” Jackie said.As they left with a security entourage to meet Jim, they remained neutral to the end."

A few booming serves later, the Americans were headed for the quarterfinals.Querrey beat Alves, 4-6, 6-3, 6-4, 7-6 (3), to give the United States a thrilling 3-2 victory over Brazil in Jacksonville, Fla., winning after his teammate John Isner lost to Thomaz Bellucci to send the countries to the deciding fifth match.“I was very happy with the way I battled through,” Querrey said. “I fought through the tough points and got breaks in the second, third and fourth sets. I was just happy to get through it.”Also advancing Sunday to the quarterfinals were Canada (over Spain), Italy (over Croatia), Kazakhstan (over Austria) and the Czech Republic (over Switzerland). Clinching spots on Saturday were France (over Israel), Serbia (over Belgium) and Argentina (over Germany).Canada is in the Davis Cup quarterfinals for the first time. It defeated a five-time-champion Spanish team that was missing Rafael Nadal, David Ferrer and Nicolas Almagro because of injuries and fatigue.It was the first time since 2000 that a United States team needed to win the fifth match to advance, and Querrey started fast, breaking Alves in the second game. But Alves, ranked No. 141, responded with breaks of his own in the third and ninth games to take the opening set.Querrey responded with a consistent array of crosscourt winners to control play the rest of the way.Isner got off to a fast start in the first match of the day, then went on to a 2-6, 6-4, 6-7 (7), 6-4, 6-3 loss to the 25th-ranked Bellucci.“This hurts a lot,” Isner said. “I could have won this match. I just couldn’t quite win the big points. It’s almost like I wanted it too badly.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/ray-lewiss-legacy-of-greatness-and-contradictions.html,"NEW ORLEANSFor a month, Ray Lewis had spoken quite a bit about his so-called last ride, and the first question posed to him here Monday was whether he had found himself thinking about the end: his last game, his last speech, his last pregame prayer, his last question about a double murder and distractions.He said that he hadn’t, that he wouldn’t, that he couldn’t. But only Lewis knows where his mind meandered Sunday night while he spit fury at his teammates; while he sat alone on the edge of the Ravens’ bench with his head bowed; while he chased after San Francisco receivers who ran him ragged across the middle of the field; while the 49ers spun a 22-point deficit into a dazzling comeback that expired at the Baltimore 5-yard line.Even in this festive city, the mood all week for Lewis’s retirement party had been subdued. The celebration began anew after the Ravens eked out a 34-31 victory in Super Bowl XLVII, sending Lewis out in style, as a champion for the second time. From his podium afterward, Lewis called out to running back Ray Rice, seated across the interview area: “Raymond! We made it!”“I can think about myself a little bit now,” Lewis said. “What better way to go out?”Two of his sons soon joined him, and a group of relatives waited nearby. They waited for dad, son, nephew, a man who preaches and preens, steers and struts. Lewis is victim and hypocrite, community pillar and obstructer of justice, a God-fearing man who fathered six children with four women.“I don’t know anybody, honestly, who has lived a perfect life,” Lewis said.No one does, and no one has. Taking the measure of any man is complicated, but even more so when all his fortes and foibles are on such public display, of such public interest. The temptation is to draw an overarching conclusion, because it is convenient to do so, when in truth Lewis — and, to be fair, for different reasons — is perhaps more polarizing than another professed Christian, Tim Tebow.So far, Tebow has not been linked to any performance-enhancing substances. Twice last week, Lewis strongly rebuffed an article by SI.com stating that he had taken a deer antler extract that contained IGF-1, an insulinlike growth hormone banned by the N.F.L., to help him recover from a torn triceps. The implication agitated him, but Lewis said he was “too blessed to be stressed.”He refrained then from quoting Scripture, to him a pastime as common as karate, cycling, swimming or any of his other cross-training pursuits.“I never got to a point that I stayed the same,” Lewis said. “Every year, I was always getting different, climbing, climbing and climbing.”Lewis arrived in Baltimore in 1996, the year the franchise relocated from Cleveland. He has seen the Ravens reach two Super Bowls and four A.F.C. championship games in nine playoff appearances. He has also seen them finish 4-12 and 5-11 and 6-10. A lot happens in 17 years.One day, he is the snarling leader of an ascending defense. The next, at 24, he is accused of murder. Two people dead. Future uncertain. Reputation stained. Perception altered, then and evermore. Lewis eventually pleaded guilty to a lesser charge, serving no time in prison, paying a $250,000 fine levied by the N.F.L. But that night in January 2000 is no less a part of his legacy than his two defensive player of the year awards. It is the equivalent of an armpit birthmark — out of view but always there.“I live with that every day,” Lewis said. “You maybe can take a break from it. I don’t. I live with it every day in my life.”The episode strengthened his faith. It also turned into one of those accessible redemption narratives the next season, when the Ravens won the Super Bowl and Lewis was selected as the game’s most valuable player. He is different now, he said. Less of a follower. More of a leader.“He just wanted us all to feel what it feels like to win this thing,” quarterback Joe Flacco said after Sunday’s victory. “He felt it, and of course, he wanted us to feel it again.”Lewis’s influence on his teammates is genuine, as is their veneration of him. Rice calls him Mufasa, after the strong and courageous father from “The Lion King.” Terrell Suggs, when asked whether the deer antler accusations had distracted the Ravens, bristled, then said of Lewis, “We know our general.” Suggs, a loquacious linebacker, shared his first interaction with the 6-foot-1, 245-pound Lewis at a commercial shoot before Suggs was drafted in 2003.“I thought Ray Lewis was 6-foot-6, 275 pounds, all muscle,” Suggs said, adding, “I was like, ‘Oh, you’re not that tall.’ It’s just something about the guy.”That something — mystique and magnetism to some, arrogance and self-importance to others — has trailed Lewis from that first day of practice 17 years ago to Sunday’s kickoff.“I was here long enough to see the beginning and actually feel the end,” Lewis said. “I’ve watched people’s careers end totally differently. I’ve watched injuries take out people, and I’ve watched the sad stories. I always said that I never wanted to go out that way.”Every day, Lewis said, teammates try to persuade him to play another season. Ed Reed is not convinced.“Ain’t no telling,” Reed said. “He might make a comeback. He may play 10 games next year.”Maybe, maybe not. The attention of a return would flatter him, but Lewis stressed that he was done. He wants to tend to his family and his community.“And,” he said, “I have run my course in the game.”The 49ers, no doubt, respect Lewis, but they do not fear him. They picked on him early and often, exposing his coverage skills in the open field. First, Michael Crabtree, then Vernon Davis, exploited him for long gains. Lewis was on the field for the Ravens’ late stand, but he neither undermined them nor boosted them to victory; he just played.His career could have ended a month ago in Baltimore, wrapped in the embrace of an adoring city. Or in chilly Denver or blustery Foxborough, Mass., where the Ravens toppled the top seeds. It did not. Instead it ended in the Superdome on Sunday, in a victory in the final game of the N.F.L. season, the most important on its calendar, the ultimate stage for the ultimate showman, like him or not."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/showing-guts-49ers-colin-kaepernick-falls-just-short-of-glory.html,"NEW ORLEANS — San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick slumped forward toward the microphone, his eyes aimed downward, his face blank. Reporters pressed in all around him. They wanted to know how it felt for his final drive to end 5 yards from the end zone, 5 yards from a lead in Super Bowl XLVII.Kaepernick mostly shrugged and spit out the shortest kinds of answers. He took no solace in this title game experience, in only his second season, only his 10th start. He said repeatedly that he never felt overwhelmed. He shrugged again.“We were trying to put points on the board,” he said.The last two months had unfolded as if crafted by a screenwriter, as Kaepernick went from backup to fill-in to full-time starter to N.F.L. sensation. In the fourth quarter Sunday night, he charged off left guard, up the middle, straight into Baltimore’s Ray Lewis. He lowered his shoulder, went right at Lewis, and picked up a short gain.On the next play, Kaepernick sprinted around left end and scampered into the end zone and trimmed a once-insurmountable deficit to 31-29. Here he came again. But it was the play before the touchdown that spoke more to his mentality, to the fear he lacked on the biggest stage in sports.The comeback attempt ultimately ended when Kaepernick’s fourth-down pass fell harmlessly to the turf. It was a mixed performance, with Kaepernick nearly perfect for the second half and mostly shaky in the first.Halfway through the game, Kaepernick looked frayed. His passes had sprayed all over the field, away from intended targets. His team had struggled to move the ball against Baltimore’s formidable defense, which contained and sacked and confused Kaepernick, made him look like a second-year player and not the second coming of Joe Montana. The Pistol offense that San Francisco had used since Kaepernick became the starter in late November looked more like the Water Gun.Then the third quarter started. Then most of the lights at the Superdome went out. Then Kaepernick and the 49ers’ offense came alive.“We thought we were going to win the football game,” offensive tackle Joe Staley said.Here was Kaepernick, the player who captivated the N.F.L. in December and January, the player who helped introduce to professional football the Pistol, who became the fourth quarterback in the Super Bowl era to start in the championship game in the season in which he made his first career start. Tom Brady also holds that distinction. So does Kurt Warner.What all three hold in common is a certain level of obscurity before they became household names. Kaepernick was drafted in the second round in 2011, but he came from Nevada and spent most of his first season and much of his second as a backup.Then, this. Late in the game Sunday, Kaepernick and the 49ers got the ball back, behind by 34-29. He scrambled for a first down. He found receiver Michael Crabtree for another. He watched running back Frank Gore bound up the left sideline, toward the end zone, the 49ers so close to obtaining their first lead.At the two-minute warning, Kaepernick was 5 yards from the end zone, from joining Montana and Steve Young and all the 49ers from the glory years. Already in the second half, he had thrown for one score and run for another. He had accumulated more than 300 passing yards (he finished with 302).The 49ers fans stood and clapped and screamed. Kaepernick rolled right, missed an open Randy Moss and threw an incompletion. On third-and-goal, Kaepernick slung a throw toward Crabtree in the right flat, and again it fell incomplete.Fourth down. Kaepernick dropped back, felt heavy pressure from his left and lobbed a fade toward the end zone. That pass also hit the ground. Coach Jim Harbaugh threw his hat in disgust and screamed at the referees. Kaepernick stood on the sideline, on top of a 49ers logo, left hand on left hip, stunned.Safety Donte Whitner later said he was “a little surprised” that the 49ers never ran the ball down there, so close to the end zone. Harbaugh said simply of his strategy, “The thinking was that we could get the touchdown.”Kaepernick and the 49ers had won seven of his first nine starts. He picked up two playoff wins. He threw 13 touchdown passes in those games and rushed for more than 400 yards. He inspired what they now call “Kaepernicking,” a kiss on the right biceps after a big play.“If Colin Kaepernick plays well in the Super Bowl, he is going to change the face of the quarterback position,” said Deion Sanders, an NFL Network analyst.The question that loomed during Super Bowl week was whether Kaepernick could handle all the accompanying pressure and hoopla and hype. Early on Sunday, the answer to that question appeared to be no.On the 49ers’ first offensive play, Kaepernick faked a handoff, rolled left and lobbed a touch pass to tight end Vernon Davis. An illegal formation penalty wiped out the completion.The first half played out along those lines. At times Kaepernick flashed the speed and arm strength and freakish physical gifts. The rest of the time he looked much more like a quarterback making his 10th start.He threw passes into double coverage and over the heads of his receivers. He seemed jittery, overwhelmed, swallowed by the moment. He locked in on Moss, forced too many throws in that direction.“We just didn’t finish our drives,” Kaepernick lamented.On the 49ers’ fourth possession, Kaepernick looked for Moss downfield. His pass sailed high, over Moss and right to safety Ed Reed. It marked another first for Kaepernick in a year filled with them: first interception by a 49ers quarterback in a Super Bowl.Later, on the podium, he tried to explain what he could not yet fully grasp, tried to put into words this magical season and the unfortunate way in which it ended. He shrugged again. Reporters continued to press in.“I don’t know,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/baseball/lavonne-paire-davis-baseball-pioneer-dies-at-88.html,"Lavonne Paire Davis, a star in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League of the 1940s and 1950s and a consultant for the hit movie “A League of Their Own,” died on Saturday in the Van Nuys section of Los Angeles. She was 88.Her death was confirmed by Jeneane Lesko, a board member of the league’s players association.Davis, who was known as Pepper Paire in her playing days, entered the league in 1944, the year after it was formed by Philip W. Wrigley, the chewing-gum magnate and owner of the Chicago Cubs. Wrigley had worried that World War II would deplete professional baseball of male players and force it to fold. That never happened, but his women’s pro league became popular anyway, and Davis became one of its most enduring players.She was 19, working as a welder in a shipyard and going to college part time, when her hobby playing softball in local leagues bore unexpected fruit: she and a friend, Faye Dancer, were recruited to join the Minneapolis Millerettes of the new league. Davis would eventually play for four teams over 10 seasons; the others were the Fort Wayne Daisies, the Racine Belles and the Grand Rapids Chicks.Playing catcher as well as shortstop and third base, she won pennants with all but the Millerettes, and her 400 career runs batted in tie her for fourth in league history. In 1950, she drove in 70 runs in 110 games for the Chicks.“Pepper was a fine catcher in the A.A.G.P.B.L., and she had a very high fielding average, .977,” said a playing summary on a Web site run by the league’s players association. “She was a steadying influence behind the plate and handled the pitchers very well and was always able to get the best out of them.”Players wore short skirts, took classes in etiquette and charm, were often accompanied by chaperons. (Davis, who boasted of having boyfriends in various cities, had a reputation for eluding hers.) They played a grueling schedule of up to 120 games a season.Davis, who grew up playing baseball with her older brother and later played on local softball teams, was one of relatively few players in the league from beyond the Midwest, but she fully embraced it. In 1944, she co-wrote a league anthem that players still sing at reunions, “Victory Song”:Our chaperons are not too softThey’re not too toughOur managers are on the ballWe’ve got a president who really knows his stuffWe’re all for one, we’re one for allWe’re All-Americans!The song was featured in “A League of Their Own,” which was released in 1992. Davis served as a consultant to the director, Penny Marshall, and was one of several players who helped inspire the fictional Dottie Hinson, a beautiful, power-hitting crowd favorite played by Geena Davis.Davis, the player, said that another player,  Dorothy Kamenshek, who died in 2010, was the league’s best player and also an inspiration for Hinson.Lavonne Paire was born on May 29, 1924, in Los Angeles. In the early 1940s, she and Dancer played amateur softball on a girls team in the Los Angeles area called the Dr. Peppers, which was named for and sponsored by the soft drink company.Davis is survived by two sons, William and Robert; a daughter, Susan; four grandchildren; and a brother.A brief biography on Davis’s Web site noted that the league seemed largely forgotten within a few decades after it ceased operations in 1954. Things began changing when players held a reunion in 1982. A flurry of news media attention was followed by recognition from the Baseball Hall of Fame and a 1988 documentary, which led to Marshall’s film.By the mid-1990s, Davis and other players were signing autographs at memorabilia shows and even serving as celebrity guests on theme cruises alongside baseball greats like Bob Feller and Billy Williams. In 2009, Davis published a memoir, “Dirt in the Skirt.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/hockey/for-lundqvist-rivalry-with-devils-and-brodeur-never-gets-old.html,"GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Henrik Lundqvist has a talent for making the very difficult look easy, but Monday it was hard for him to hide the effort. Perhaps there was no way he could come up with the save on this one.“The last time we played them was a special series,” he said, straining to come up with a new answer to the old question about what it feels like to renew the rivalry with the Devils and goaltender Martin Brodeur. “I look forward to seeing them again.”The Rangers will play the Devils on Tuesday for the first time since they lost to them in the Eastern Conference finals last spring. The rivalry picks up at Prudential Center in Newark, where it left off May 25 when Adam Henrique scored on Lundqvist in overtime in Game 6 to send the Devils to the Stanley Cup finals.“What can I say?” Lundqvist said when asked again about the matchup.Lundqvist did well in treating each iteration of the Devils/Brodeur question with courtesy and thoughtfulness, as he always does. But this time, the sense of tedium was visible.Still, the question was reasonable. The Rangers, who were the top seed in the East, went into the conference finals a slight favorite. It was the first time the teams had met in the conference finals since 1994, when the Rangers won the series on Stephane Matteau’s goal in the second overtime of Game 7.But Brodeur narrowly outplayed Lundqvist, allowing 12 goals on a .927 save percentage to Lundqvist’s 13 goals and .917.Now, to face them again had to bring up some painful memories, surely? Lundqvist said no.“When it happened and the season is over, you just try to forget about it — it hurts,” he said. “But you definitely try to learn from it.”Brodeur, 40, is almost surely headed to the Hall of Fame at the end of his N.H.L. career, which dates to 1992, all with the Devils. Lundqvist, 30, who won the Vezina Trophy as the league’s top goaltender last season, is in the prime of his career, which started in 2005, all with the Rangers. Lundqvist holds the advantage over Brodeur in regular-season matchups, with 23 victories and a .941 save percentage to 12 victories and a .920 save percentage for Brodeur.This season, both goalies are off to spotty starts. Lundqvist has a .904 save percentage, 21st among the N.H.L.’s 39 regular goalies through Sunday. Brodeur, at .899, ranked 23rd. But those numbers will almost certainly improve.Lundqvist’s admiration for Brodeur remains high. He spoke about how reliable Brodeur remains despite having played for so many years.“He doesn’t go as deep into the butterfly as younger guys, so that style of his hasn’t been as hard on his knees,” Lundqvist said. “And he can read the game so well — that’s something that improves with age if you stay sharp, and makes up for whatever quickness you might lose as you get older. Marty’s still got it.”Lundqvist said there would be no added emotions in returning to the Devils’ rink. “No, I’ve walked into that building so many times,” he said. “It’s the past now, what happened last season.“We’ve played against them so many times — there have been a lot of great games in the past,” he continued, finally finding the right combination of words and sentiments. “That’s what makes these games special. I like that.”It was another save by Lundqvist."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/baseball/mets-sandy-alderson-sticks-to-disciplined-approach.html,"The equipment van idled in the players’ parking lot at Citi Field on Monday, loaded with bats and balls and hopes and dreams, bound for Port St. Lucie, Fla. Sandy Alderson, the Mets’ general manager, will follow soon, with his golden retriever, Buddy, by his side. Alderson does not know precisely when he will leave because his daughter is due to deliver her third child this weekend. With the Mets these days, it is always about the kids.This, of course, is the default position for every noncontender: sure, we haven’t won much lately, but just wait till you see our prospects. The Mets have parted with a lot of talent to get here, including Carlos Beltran, Jose Reyes and R. A. Dickey. All are top players for contending teams.The Mets are not contenders. Alderson’s actions in three off-seasons in Flushing reflect a careful, consistent approach to building; no slapdash moves to grab headlines. This should not be surprising, because aggressive and reckless deals, in baseball operations and ownership finances, got the Mets into this hole.They could easily finish in fourth place for a fifth consecutive season. The Washington Nationals and the Atlanta Braves, built around emerging stars in their 20s, both reached the playoffs last season, and the aging Philadelphia Phillies still have that gaudy rotation. Only the Miami Marlins look weak.“The National League East may be the toughest division in baseball this year,” Alderson said Monday at an informal writers’ luncheon at the team’s executive office. “In a way, it provides a model for us. It sets a standard.“I think it also reinforces the direction we’ve taken because we don’t want to just get lucky. We want to be able to compete with teams of that caliber on a consistent basis, and in order for us to do that, we have to be methodical about how we get there.”Meet the Methodicals? No ring to it, and Alderson all but recoiled at his choice of words, immediately stressing that the Mets are not far from contention.Without identifying him by name, Alderson strongly implied that the Mets could have traded for outfielder Justin Upton, who went from Arizona to Atlanta last month, if they had parted with Matt Harvey or Zack Wheeler. They have maintained interest in another two-time All-Star outfielder, the free agent Michael Bourn.“If you look at the fundamental composition of our team, it wouldn’t take more than a couple of moves to change the whole perception of things,” Alderson said. “I don’t want anybody to believe that this is a long-term project that has no possible realization anytime soon. We’re at the point we could make significant improvement in a hurry, and we’ve been looking at ways that we can actually do that.”Signing Bourn, who is represented by Scott Boras, would make no sense for the Mets unless they could also keep their first-round draft choice, 11th overall, which would require a change to the collective bargaining agreement. That seems unlikely, and Alderson is probably right to make it a deal breaker.Love his moves or not, Alderson has been highly disciplined and, yes, methodical, virtues that often pay off in time. By trading Beltran and Dickey, he acquired possible long-term cornerstones like Wheeler, Travis d’Arnaud and Noah Syndergaard. By letting Reyes go, he kept the Mets from another long-term deal for a player past his prime. The eight-year, $138 million extension for David Wright in December may be such a contract, but it was necessary for the Mets’ credibility.“I think the patience with not only David Wright’s negotiations, but the negotiations that ended up being a trade with Toronto, was very good,” said Jeff Wilpon, the chief operating officer. “Sandy and his staff had an idea of what they wanted, and they held out until they got exactly what they wanted, and then pulled the trigger. That’s very encouraging. I think the same thing’s happening now with some of the free agents and some of the other people they’re looking at.”The Mets were the last team to sign a major league free agent this winter, agreeing last week with Shaun Marcum, a decent starter with a fragile arm. They have also stockpiled veteran right-handed relievers, with Scott Atchison, LaTroy Hawkins and, soon, Brandon Lyon.Those are sensible deals — low risk, moderate reward — in keeping with Alderson’s pattern. The most he has spent on a free agent is $12 million for two years on reliever Frank Francisco, who had a 5.53 earned run average last season.“I think there is a general hesitancy, given where we are as a team, to become too active too early in free agency,” Alderson said. “We’ve got a lot of money coming off the books next year.”The Mets will shed more than $50 million next off-season, when their obligations to Johan Santana, Jason Bay, Francisco and others expire. Alderson did not dwell on those payouts — not with Wilpon, his boss, seated directly across from him at a conference table — but said the Mets were still prepared for the unexpected, even now.He meant the long-shot pursuit of Bourn, who has not received the big payday he expected in free agency. Credit the Mets, once wild spenders, for pursuing him reasonably. Desperation drives bad decisions, and Alderson is desperate for only one thing.“We are committed to trying to do this right,” he said."

Young was banished from the team in November for what Coach Jim Schwarz called unacceptable behavior and was later put on injured reserve. Young was also told to stay away from the team during its last off-season for punching his teammate Louis Delmas when Delmas was not looking.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/football/strange-is-normal-for-new-orleans-jere-longman.html,"NEW ORLEANSCan we just agree to hold every Super Bowl in New Orleans? At least here, we can always count on the entertainment of a deep and abiding weirdness.My first Super Bowl, between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Minnesota Vikings, came at Tulane Stadium in 1975. A naïve college student, I wasn’t expecting a craps game to break out at Commissioner Pete Rozelle’s annual bacchanal. And in my limited hotel experience, the room service menu had never included pitchers of bourbon.In the early, tortured history of the New Orleans Saints, strangeness was the only normal. Archie Manning recalled a free-agent punt returner who arrived from the airport for a preseason game carrying his bags and a parrot on his shoulder.“It was a trend for some guys to have an expensive and good-looking parrot,” Manning said. “So this guy put his parrot in his locker, and during the game, he fielded about five punts. He fumbled twice and when we got back to the locker room, the parrot was dead.”So it only seemed natural that Sunday’s thrilling and interrupted 34-31 victory by Baltimore over San Francisco followed a power failure in the third quarter and a week of stories about the restorative powers of deer antler velvet extract. And while we’re on the subject of the Ravens, who knew that cheerleaders, like boxers, had weight limits?Here in a state that bills itself as the Sportsman’s Paradise, there was bound to be a Super Bowl story about deer antler velvet extract. This one was provided with great hilarity by Sports Illustrated. And it involved Ray Lewis, the retiring linebacker who apparently grew desperate in October to recover from a torn triceps muscle in time for the playoffs.Of course, 49ers fans, given their understanding nature, were willing to give Lewis a complete pass on his medical quest involving some of the more familiar and popular ruminants.“Does he freeze in a car’s headlights?” Jeff Bush of Odessa, Tex., asked.According to Sports Illustrated, hours after tearing his right triceps muscle Oct. 14, Lewis spoke by phone with Mitch Ross, a co-owner of a company called Sports With Alternatives to Steroids. The call was taped by Ross. During the conversation, Ross advised Lewis to spray the extract under his tongue every two hours, pop deer antler pills and guzzle something called negatively charged water to stay hydrated.Ross also suggested that Lewis place stickers on his right elbow. Various stickers, called chips, contain holograms that are supposed to help players manage pain and increase stamina. And shield them against the energy-zapping emissions of cellphones in packed stadiums.There are only two problems with the company’s claims about deer extract, stickers and negatively charged water: there is little scientific evidence to support them, and the extract happens to contain a banned, muscle-building hormone called IGF-1, or insulinlike growth factor.Lewis denied using the spray. And on Friday, Ross held what might have been the world’s first deer antler spray news conference. He never saw Lewis spritz the substance under his tongue, Ross said (though he could not explain the linebacker’s insatiable craving for home screenings of “Bambi”).Ross did say he had sent more than 600 energy stickers to Ravens players during the playoffs. A number of stickers — which are legal, if scientifically dubious — were visible on players after Sunday’s game. It was another sign that athletes would use anything that they believed would give them a performance edge. And they have for centuries, beginning with bull testicles in ancient Greece.At the 2011 Women’s World Cup, North Korea’s soccer team claimed that positive doping tests resulted from musk deer gland therapy used to treat players who had been struck by lightning. The explanation was not as convincing as it was inventive, and North Korea was banned from the next World Cup.This being deer-hunting territory, actual hunters were curious about antler extract. They had heard of doe urine to attract bucks and raccoon urine to mask human scent, but not antler spray. “Where do you get it?” Kenny Kitto of Watson, La., said. “A deer doctor?”On his cellphone, Larry Feeler carries a photograph of the antler chandelier at his home in Austin, Tex. Traveling to Sunday’s game, he heard that ground-up deer horns contain oil that can smooth wrinkles. “Maybe I can spray that stuff on my face and get an instant face-lift,” he said of the velvet extract. Then he thought twice. “I don’t want a horn growing out my head.”At least Lewis had a chance to participate in a final Super Bowl before retiring in victory. Not so Courtney Lenz, a Ravens cheerleader who claimed she was benched because she put on one and a half pounds during the season. Ravens officials said the issue was more complicated. Still, Lenz found much support on social media and among some Baltimore fans.“Bless her heart,” said Jeanne Hall, an academic counselor at Destrehan High School in Louisiana and mentor to Baltimore safety Ed Reed. “We have a lot of sympathy for her. We’re from the South; we’re all overweight. What are you going to do in New Orleans but put on a few pounds?”Who knows? Maybe a couple of squirts of deer antler spray can cure muffin tops as well as torn triceps muscles."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/football/ravens-to-pay-for-joe-flaccos-exquisite-timing.html,"NEW ORLEANSShortly before the N.F.L. draft five years ago, a reporter visiting Joe Flacco’s childhood home a few miles from Philadelphia was asked by his father, Stephen, “You draw the short straw with this story?” His son was sprawled on a living room sofa, his long legs stretched out while he watched Matt Ryan being interviewed on television.Flacco was the accidental prospect then, so unsure about his football future that after his junior season in college, he asked his football coach if it was O.K. if he played baseball. His coach informed him he was going to be a draft choice, prompting Flacco to reply, “Really, Coach?”Flacco is a prospect no more, although Monday, owing to his sleeplessness, he had the same look of detachment as he did that spring day in the home where he still shared a bedroom with his brother, where a batting cage sat in the backyard. He had just received the keys to a Corvette — he was shocked, he said — for being the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, won by the Baltimore Ravens, 34-31, over the San Francisco 49ers.He was off to Walt Disney World, then to New York to appear on David Letterman’s show Monday night and then eventually back to Baltimore for the requisite victory parade. The vertiginous climb that carried him from also-ran at the University of Pittsburgh has put him ahead of Ryan, who was drafted before him, and into the stratosphere of championship quarterbacks.How far he has risen will be quantified later this off-season when the Ravens will have to come to contract terms with him. No other football free agent has done more in one year to solidify his bargaining position than Flacco. He turned down the Ravens’ offer last July — reported to be about $16 million a year — telling his agent, Joe Linta, that he thought he would improve. Linta said he thought Flacco should be paid like a top-five quarterback. There was no animosity with the Ravens, but there also have not been any negotiations since then. Now there will be, under entirely different circumstances, a snapshot of the shifting landscape teams face when they roll the dice on contracts.The Ravens gambled and will now pay for it, either in the form of a long-term contract, or with the franchise tag. Flacco’s contract, for five years and $29 million, is about to expire. If the Ravens use the exclusive-rights tag, they will spend about $20 million next year on Flacco but block any other suitors. If they use the nonexclusive tag, likely worth around $14.6 million, they risk losing Flacco to a franchise willing to give up two first-round picks for him.Before this postseason, that would have seemed a ludicrous proposition. No longer. At just 28 — it seems Flacco has been around much longer because the Ravens have been in the playoffs in each of his five seasons — Flacco moved himself into Joe Montana and Kurt Warner territory, throwing 11 touchdown passes and no interceptions in Baltimore’s run to the Super Bowl title. Late Sunday night, Flacco joked with NFL Network that the team owner Steve Bisciotti had told him in a private conversation that if the team won the Super Bowl, Flacco could go pound on his desk and stick it to him in contract negotiations. That, Flacco said, was exactly what he intended to do.“Maybe I was lowballing it by saying top five,” Linta, who was losing his voice, said Monday morning. “Right now, you have to look at that, based on current events. You have to be mindful of, when a deal is done of this magnitude, are you doing the deal based on what they’ve already done or what he’s going to do? On both fronts, Joe is exemplary. Eleven touchdowns. All those road playoff wins. Only a moron would say that is not significant.”Flacco has long been considered a step below the top-tier quarterbacks, but if his Joe Cool persona has undermined his profile — even Ray Lewis encouraged him to become more vocal, a suggestion Flacco rejected as unnecessary to leadership — he already has as many championships as Drew Brees, Peyton Manning and Aaron Rodgers. Brees’s contract, reached last off-season, is the one to watch in Flacco’s negotiations. It was for $100 million over five years, and was as much a gift for what Brees had done as for what the Saints hoped he could do again. Brees just turned 34.“We didn’t sit there in July and say, ‘I’ll turn this down and I’ll show them,’ ” Linta said. “It was, ‘I think I’m getting better and we’ll be worth more down the road.’ This salary cap is going to go up eventually, and you don’t want to be late to the dance on the rising cap numbers. You want to participate when the cap does accelerate.”The relatively flat salary cap — which is projected to be just at or slightly below $121 million in 2013 — will complicate the negotiations because the Ravens are loaded with free agents, including some who were critical to their Super Bowl victory. While Lewis is retiring, linebacker Paul Kruger, who had four and a half sacks in the postseason, and linebacker Dannell Ellerbe are free agents. So is cornerback Cary Williams, who somehow avoided ejection in the Super Bowl despite shoving one of the officials during a skirmish; offensive lineman Bryant McKinnie; and tight end Dennis Pitta.And Coach John Harbaugh said Sunday that he and safety Ed Reed, who insists that he will not retire after winning his first title in his hometown, talked on the bus after the game and agreed that they wanted Reed back in Baltimore. Securing Flacco is certainly the first priority, and a long-term deal would free cap space to allow the Ravens to keep some of the other players.But the Ravens are now facing the N.F.L. version of the Rubik’s Cube, trying to piece together a puzzle with so many moving parts.“I’m pretty optimistic, but who knows?” the sleepy Flacco said Monday morning. “There’s all kinds of crazy things that can happen with these contracts that we’ve all seen before.”Nothing crazier than what Flacco has been through, though. On Saturday, he and his wife wanted to get out of the team hotel. They hopped in a cab, which took a half-hour to go the few packed blocks to Café Du Monde in the French Quarter. Flacco raved about the beignets, but then found himself channeling a mall Santa, with a line of fans bearing cameras.For the player who had trouble being recruited out of high school, who knew nothing of the football factory process, who thought just six years ago that his future in the sport was so hopeless he might as well try baseball, the rise has been as great as the raise he is about to receive."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/soccer/timothy-chandler-ready-to-commit-to-us-national-team.html,"The United States national team will open the final round of World Cup qualifying on Wednesday in Honduras, and Timothy Chandler will be a significant addition to the team’s backline. Once he enters the game, he will finally be an official American player.Chandler’s history with the national team has been rocky since he made his international debut in 2011. He was born in Frankfurt to a German mother and an American father who was stationed in Europe while serving in the United States military.Growing up, Chandler lived briefly in the United States before returning to Germany. At a young age he showed significant potential as a soccer player and joined the youth teams of Eintracht Frankfurt. In 2010, he moved to F.C. Nuremberg, and his career quickly took off.Almost immediately after the Bundesliga winter break in January 2011, Chandler became Nuremberg’s starting right back and earned rave reviews. The United States coach at the time, Bob Bradley, quickly called up Chandler for exhibitions against Argentina and Paraguay that March. In his international debut against Argentina at the Meadowlands, Chandler entered as a substitute and helped spark a comeback in a 1-1 tie.“It was a special experience, like something out of a film,” he said at the time. “Against Paraguay he substituted me out before the end and the fans sung, ‘Happy Birthday’ to me. It was really fantastic and it was another thing that made me feel really good about the whole experience.”But since then, Chandler had become a source of frustration for coaches and fans by repeatedly declining to play for the American team in important competitions.It began when he turned down the chance to play for the United States in the 2011 Gold Cup, citing fatigue after his first Bundesliga season. In 2012, after Jurgen Klinsmann replaced Bradley as the United States coach, Chandler did not take part in the initial stage of World Cup qualifying. Since the Gold Cup and the qualifiers were official competitions, Chandler’s decision to opt out of both after playing in friendlies fueled speculation that he was keeping his options open to play for Germany.Under FIFA rules, dual-national players, even those who have played for youth national teams, can change their international allegiance as long as they have not played in an official competition at the senior level. An appearance in Wednesday’s World Cup qualifier would commit Chandler, 22, to the United States permanently.Chandler, who has represented Germany only at the under-15 level, said that he was never holding out for a German call-up, but rather choosing to focus on his club career with Nuremberg.“I’m now deeply involved and established as a professional player where I wasn’t before,” Chandler said through an interpreter in a telephone interview. “This is the primary reason for my decision to now play for the United States.”Chandler returned to the American team for the final game of 2012, an exhibition against Russia, and played 90 minutes in a 2-2 tie. He told U.S. Soccer’s Web site before that game that he was now “in 1,000 percent” with the team.To date, Chandler played nine times for the United States without playing in a game that would tie him to the team permanently. That is expected to change on Wednesday because the aging Steve Cherundolo, the Americans’ usual right back, is out with a knee injury.Chandler could be a huge addition, as he will give Klinsmann an elite level of speed and athleticism on the right side. Since Klinsmann was hired in 2011, the team has struggled offensively, but Chandler has the ability to move forward quickly and stretch defenses.“He’s growing into his role as a full-time professional,” Klinsmann said. “This opportunity coming up, a big World Cup qualifier, is huge for him.”Midfielder Jermaine Jones, who joined the national team in 2010, shares a similar background; he was born in Frankfurt to an American father and also represented Germany at the youth levels.Jones also developed at Eintracht Frankfurt and knows Chandler from his time there.“I’ve been following Timmy for a number of years in the Bundesliga,” said Jones, who plays for Schalke. “He has tremendous quality and athleticism.”Jones added: “The team has been amazing in the way they receive and integrate all the dual nationals who have chosen to play for America.”Chandler said that his integration into the national team has changed the way he views the American culture. His links with America growing up were distant and his relationship with his father, who died in 2012, was limited.“I feel increasingly more American,” Chandler said. “I follow American current events now. Every time I fly over to the United States, it feels like I am coming home.”Chandler’s visits to the United States are expected to become far more frequent. If he plays well, it is likely he can be a regular contributor beyond the 2018 World Cup.He said he hoped that finally becoming tied to the national team would erase the widely held skepticism about his commitment.“I’m looking forward to this qualifying game, and I’m completely committed to this team for the future,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/football/for-raven-from-new-orleans-a-glorious-return-two-ways.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Just as Emily London-Jones stepped into her office at Xavier University on Monday morning, co-workers engulfed her in a way that the San Francisco 49ers could never seem to encircle her son, Jacoby.She had slept little. Phone messages piled up. It would hardly be a normal morning in the student financial aid office, where London-Jones is the director. Then again, it is not every day that your son scores two touchdowns in the Super Bowl in a celebrative return to his hometown.Almost everyone in the office wore a purple Baltimore Ravens T-shirt. A sign on a conference room door said “Super Bowl Champion Mom.” London-Jones wore a pair of hand-painted sneakers bearing a likeness of her son and his mantra, “Catch me if you can.”The 49ers could not. Not often enough. In Baltimore’s stirring 34-31 victory, Jacoby Jones finished off a 56-yard touchdown pass with great alertness, getting to his feet after not being touched by a defender. Then with a long, angular sprinter’s stride, he returned a kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown, the longest ever in a  National Football League postseason game.“I’ve been an underdog all my life,” Jones, 28, said. “When I got home, I was determined.”Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco was named the game’s most valuable player, but Xavier’s student aid office gave the award to Jones. Many of the cheering counselors had known him since he was a skinny, pigeon-toed boy who had great speed but, many football experts thought, not enough size to make it to the N.F.L.“We share in that joy like he’s ours,” said Selena Vance, the senior counselor who is known as “Sis” to Jones. She watched Sunday’s game with her sons in Baton Rouge, La., and found herself running alongside the Ravens’ star during his kickoff return. “I jumped off the couch and scared the dog,” she said.It was a crowning evening for a mother and her only child, who used to attend church as a toddler in New Orleans wearing an Archie Manning jersey and a miniature Saints uniform. “He’d say, ‘Football, Mommy, football,’ ” London-Jones, 56, said with a laugh. “He’d be in the stroller with a bottle and the helmet would spin around his head.”At Abramson High School in New Orleans, Jones was an all-around athlete. But, by his own description, he stood but 5 feet 7 inches and weighed 160 pounds “soaking wet with bricks in my pockets.” He attended Southeastern Louisiana to run track but struggled. His mother said she gave him an ultimatum: “Either find a school that fits you or flip burgers.”Jones next tried out for the football team at Lane College, a historically black Division II school in Jackson, Tenn. On Aug. 26, 2005, his mother left New Orleans to see him play, taking only one extra set of clothes, believing along with many others that Hurricane Katrina would be a minor disruption. Instead, her home along the shore of Lake Pontchartrain took on four feet of water. It was a month and a half before she saw the house again, a year before she returned to live.Meanwhile, at Lane College, Jones began to develop the resourcefulness of a receiver and a kick returner and a wiry muscularity on a frame that has filled out to 6-3 and 220 pounds. The Houston Texans selected him in the third round of the 2007 N.F.L. draft. An arrest on a charge of driving under the influence in 2008 brought public embarrassment and a private realization about professional responsibility.“That was when the light went off in my head,” Jones, who entered a diversionary program for first-time offenders, told The Baltimore Sun last summer. “It’s not college anymore. I had to learn from my mistakes. I straightened my act out.”Still, Jones could not match his toughness and explosive speed with consistently secure hands. Last May, the Texans released him. He signed with the Ravens and a metamorphosis began. Jones has become known as both selfless and dependable, lacerating on kick returns. Linebacker Ray Lewis referred to him by the nickname Clutch on Sunday. During the regular season, Jones returned a kickoff 108 yards for a touchdown against Dallas and 105 yards for a score against Oakland. He also took a punt 63 yards to the end zone against Pittsburgh. After six N.F.L. seasons, Jones made the Pro Bowl.Then, in the divisional round of the playoffs, he scored an improbable touchdown with 31 seconds left in the game. On a frigid day in Denver, Jones made a 70-yard reception that sent the game against the Broncos into overtime, stunning local fans into silence and providing the lifeline for an eventual Baltimore victory in a second overtime.His Super Bowl touchdowns were not viewed as redemption or bitter payback against Houston, Jones said. Instead, he spoke graciously of the Texans, saying: “I thank them. They gave me an opportunity to play football, coming from Lane College, in the N.F.L.”As the Ravens arrived in town last week, London-Jones cooked for her son and his teammates, preparing 80 quarts of gumbo, 120 servings of jambalaya, 4 gallons of green peas, 30 pounds of potato salad and an endless supply of bread pudding.“Hey, Mama, it was the gumbo,” Lewis yelled toward her after the game, explaining the victory, one in which mother and son dutifully played their roles.Two minutes before halftime, Jones ran an inside route as Flacco stepped up in the pocket, luring the 49ers’ safety. Jones then broke upfield. Baltimore had not run the exact play all season, and San Francisco was left vulnerable. Jones waited on the underthrown ball and cradled it as he went to the ground. Untouched, he got up, spun, gave a head fake and then outran cornerback Chris Culliver into the end zone for a 56-yard score.“That was just backyard football right there,” Jones said. “Catch me if you can. That’s like playing freeze tag.”Beforehand, Jones had suggested that it would be unwise for San Francisco to kick the ball to him. “Not talking trash,” Jones said, “but I wouldn’t do it.”As the second half opened, Jones fielded a kickoff 2 yards from the back of the end zone, sped upfield and was touched only once before darting right and finding an unimpeded path to the end zone, where he gave Baltimore a 28-6 lead and danced exuberantly.“They were not expecting us to run a straight middle return,” Jones said. “We ran it straight down their throat.”Shortly after the run, a power failure halted the game, which did not seem to upset Jones, who was still recovering from his kickoff sprint.“I was tired,” he said after the game. “I was throwing up.”San Francisco rallied, but Baltimore repelled the 49ers and hung on for victory. Afterward, Jones knelt in prayer, then made confetti angels on the turf.“It was always a goal to play in the Super Bowl,” Jones said. “Being able to come home and play, it’s like icing on the cake. You can drop the cherry and the sprinkles on it, that’s to win it.”"

Sure, we’ve got Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco talking to David Letterman about deer antler spray, but where’s the reverence of all things football? Where can we go to brush off everything we know about head injuries? Where’s Ray Lewis’s daily sermon? When do we get to stare into Colin Kaepernick’s tattoos and look for clues to the universe’s meaning again? What, we have to go the entire day without a Harbaugh?! Medics!Yes, as Jeff MacGregor argues on ESPN.com, the Super Bowl has hijacked our culture. But now it’s gone. So we are left to continue to ponder the Superdome blackout, which hilariously might have been caused by upgrades rushed online because power officials were afraid of a Superdome blackout, according to The New Orleans Times-Picayune. Or we can entertain ourselves with the story that the Ravens lost track of the Vince Lombardi Trophy for a while. We can wonder along with Mike Preston of The Baltimore Sun whether success and a new contract will change Flacco or what would have happened had the Ravens not made such a gamble in hiring John Harbaugh five seasons ago, as Clark Judge writes on CBSSports.com. The what-ifs are most painful in San Francisco, of course, where they are obsessing on a final series gone wrong, Ann Killion writes in The San Francisco Chronicle.But eventually we are going to have to emerge from the post-Super Bowl stupor and face the rest of the sports world. This is not going to be easy. What awaits us are endless tales of the Yankees’ Alex Rodriguez, his mystery recuperation spot, parsing his every nonword along with Bill Madden of The Daily News, following the Major League Baseball sleuths as they try to sniff out the truth behind the Miami New Times’s exposé of A-Rod and the fishy wellness clinic, writes Tom Verducci on SI.com. Yes, that’s what a sports hangover feels like.You could turn your attention to the N.B.A. to celebrate the first anniversary of Linsanity, which will make Knicks fans nostalgic no matter how well their current team is doing these days. Of course, in case you lost track, Miami, with that LeBron James fellow, is still awfully good.The N.H.L. has its season in full swing, which turns out to be a dangerous place, especially for a referee in the firing line of a slap shot. The sport might even drive you to attend a game wearing a horse head.We do have college basketball’s frenzied playoff season coming up, but March’s madness may need to be treated with antidepressants considering the current state of college sports.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/soccer/us-focuses-on-qualifier-as-others-keep-danger-at-bay.html,"SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — Near the start of an afternoon news conference inside a hotel ballroom here on Tuesday, a member of the local news media prefaced his question to Jurgen Klinsmann, the coach of the United States soccer team, with a greeting.“Hello,” the reporter said, rising from his front-row seat. “Welcome to our beautiful country and very friendly city, San Pedro Sula.”It was a poignant remark, considering the status of the team during its short stay here for a World Cup qualifying match Wednesday afternoon. The Americans arrived amid a flurry of warnings and security alerts identifying San Pedro Sula as the most violent city on the planet. According to the United States Department of State, there were 159 homicides for every 100,000 residents in 2011. The area’s population is about one million.Against this backdrop, the United States team’s three-day visit has been tailored so players will not encounter any of the city: none of its beauty or friendliness, and, most important, none of its dangers.“A majority of serious crimes are never solved; of the 24 murders committed against U.S. citizens since January 2010, police have closed none,” reads an ominous travel advisory released this winter by the State Department. “Members of the Honduran National Police have been known to engage in criminal activity, such as murder and car theft. The government of Honduras lacks sufficient resources to properly investigate and prosecute cases, and to deter violent crime.”Honduras has long been plagued by poverty and political turmoil, and the aftereffects of a military coup in 2009 further rattled its infrastructure, divided its people and disrupted the delivery of foreign aid. San Pedro Sula, the country’s second-largest city, sits just inside Honduras’s northwest border, serving as a key industrial and transportation hub. These traits have also contributed to its rise as a major way station for drug traffickers.Such criminals, the advisory continued, “commit crimes such as murder, kidnapping, carjacking, armed robbery, rapes, and other aggravated assaults.” The advisory suggested that Americans remain in groups when outdoors and avoid walking on the street altogether at night.Despite this, Michael Bradley, one of the team’s midfield stalwarts and a frequent participant in regional qualifying matches, said concerns about safety or security never entered players’ minds.“Between U.S. Soccer and the American government, we always get taken care of very well,” Bradley said. “Really, from the time we get here to the time we leave, all that’s left up to us is to step on the field and give the best possible performance.”Still, for the American team and its traveling staff, qualifying for the World Cup has never been as simple as stepping on the field for a game.The United States Embassy in Tegucigalpa advised all American journalists to stay at a single hotel just outside the city center. The team settled into similar accommodations about a mile down the road. The embassy and the local police coordinated to provide security at each hotel, and the team and the traveling journalists received a stern security briefing from a State Department representative after they arrived.Similar warnings were also passed to the small contingent of fans — only 15 or so, according to a U.S. Soccer spokesman — who traveled from the United States. The ones who did come seemed bolder than the journalists or team members.“It’s an industrial town and you can tell the city has its rough spots, but I walked all over the city center yesterday afternoon with no worry,” said Craig Hahn, 25, an engineer from Arlington, Va. “I’ve honestly felt more in danger at night in parts of Pittsburgh and D.C.”Even so, Hahn and others said they were heeding warnings not to walk alone after sunset.The players did not walk around outside at all. Generally, athletes on the road spend downtime shopping or eating out. But for the American team this week, their sporadic and fractured views of the city came from inside hotel rooms and chartered buses.“I see what I see from the window,” striker Jozy Altidore said.Killing time indoors, for this reason, becomes an issue for the players to an extent to which that few adults could relate: “I’m the Ping-Pong and poker champ of the team, so that tells you all you need to know,” Altidore said.The team ventured from its hotel for the first time late Tuesday afternoon for a short training session at Estadio Olímpico Metropolitano, the site of Wednesday’s match. Their short ride was completed with the help of a motorcade of police cars and motorcycles that stopped traffic and turned heads at every intersection. Inside the empty stadium, the players practiced on a field ringed with guards holding assault rifles.Once full, the stadium, which holds about 45,000 people, will offer another set of challenges. The Honduran government declared Wednesday a national holiday so people could attend the match or watch from home during the workday.“In terms of batteries being thrown at me,” Altidore said, “I think I’ve seen it all. I’m sure we can expect some of that tomorrow.”If all goes as planned, that would be the only discomfort the players encounter this week."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/baseball/in-cleveland-bringing-back-baseball-history-and-a-neighborhood.html,"CLEVELAND — The grassy field at East 66th Street and Lexington Avenue in this city’s Hough neighborhood has a rich baseball past.League Park, a home to the Cleveland Indians until 1946, once stood there. At home plate, near the site’s northwest corner, Elmer Smith hit the first World Series grand slam in 1920; in the same game, second baseman Bill Wambsganss recorded the only World Series triple play — an unassisted one. Babe Ruth swatted his 500th homer there in 1929 and Joe DiMaggio rapped two singles and a double in the 56th and final game of his record hitting streak in 1941 at League Park.Cy Young delivered the first pitch there in 1891, Addie Joss pitched a perfect game in 1908, and a 17-year-old Bob Feller struck out 15 in 1936 to earn the first of his 266 victories. A 45-foot-high fence known as the Great Wall ran east from right field to center field along Lexington Avenue; its concrete base and steel girders topped by mesh created baffling caroms for outfielders while protecting pedestrians and vehicles on the other side.The site has remained virtually untouched since the stadium was razed in 1951. But it is expected to reopen in turn-back-the-clock glory, featuring a baseball diamond aligned as it was during its major league heyday. The field will be made of artificial turf to reduce postponements in Little League, high school, college and recreational baseball games. It may also be used for soccer and football games, as well as concerts and other events. A second baseball diamond and a children’s water park, surrounded by a winding walking track, are to be built on the property.The project’s historical flourishes are to include a grandstand from first base to third base along the footprint of League Park. A visitor center will help buttress the portion of the original brick facade that is being held up by steel supports. The dilapidated two-story building that had been the stadium’s ticket office is to become a League Park museum. A facsimile of the Great Wall is to be built, after the foundation of the original one is excavated for display in the museum.City officials and community leaders believe that the baseball ground’s reincarnation will accelerate the neighborhood’s resurgence after decades of decline.“I can see things beginning to change,” said Robert Denson, an insurance manager who settled in Hough and is vice president of the League Park Heritage Association. “I think League Park will also be an attraction. Maybe people will think, ‘I can come in and start a business.’ ”The project includes nearby residential and commercial renovation, along with road and landscaping improvements. Expensive homes are under construction. Two blocks south of the ballpark site, at a community-run vineyard called Chateau Hough, Frontenac and Traminette vines snake through trellises; a usable yield for wine is expected this year.The neighborhood neglect that left the League Park site untouched also preserved it for an ambitious project. But the redevelopment is hardly a new concept. In 1979, when Bob DiBiasio joined the Indians’ public relations department, he was sent to a municipal meeting convened to consider options for the land. That initiative fizzled, as have others since.“This go-round, it seems, for the first time, that the city is truly committed to making something happen,” DiBiasio, now the Indians’ senior vice president for public affairs, said in an interview at Progressive Field, the team’s home since 1994.This is not the first demolished stadium site to be restored for baseball use by a city’s residents, although it not common. Last year, Heritage Field, a series of diamonds with historical markers on the site of the original Yankee Stadium, opened in the Bronx. In St. Louis, baseball has been played for decades on the grass once known as Sportsman’s Park.Cleveland is financing the $6.3 million project primarily through park bond funds. It has also received a $150,000 cultural preservation grant from the state and $75,000 from the Department of Transportation. An effort is being made to give subcontracting work to small businesses in the city, and Hough residents will be recruited for some of the labor.Once the site reopens later this year, Clevelanders will enjoy free access, with some revenue coming from rentals to outside groups and sales of commemorative bricks to be placed in a plaza near the visitor center, said Michael Cox, director of the city’s Department of Public Works.Cleveland Mayor Frank Jackson said, “This is the season for League Park, and now we can preserve an important part of Cleveland’s history in a  way that will be enjoyed by generations to come.”Among the project’s advocates is Bob Zimmer, who runs the Baseball Heritage Museum downtown. The museum and the League Park Heritage Association are bidding jointly to manage the new park, including scheduling games and events.“Cleveland has a rich history in baseball,” Zimmer said on a recent frigid morning at the old stamping grounds of Tris Speaker and Nap Lajoie. “And it’s important to preserve and tell the stories of the past so we can know where we came from. League Park was the birthing scene of baseball in Cleveland and was home not only to the Indians, but to the Cleveland Buckeyes of the Negro leagues.”Two Cleveland teams won championships during their League Park years: in 1920, the Indians defeated the Brooklyn Dodgers at home, and in 1945, the Buckeyes clinched on the road against the Homestead Grays.Beginning in 1934, the Indians played at League Park most weekdays and at Municipal Stadium most holidays and weekends. The Indians moved all their games to Municipal Stadium for the 1947 season.On Sept. 21, 1946, the Indians played their final game at League Park. Their starting pitcher against the Detroit Tigers that day was Bob Kuzava, who was making his major league debut.Kuzava, one of three living players from the 1946 club, said that his wife and in-laws came from Michigan to see him.“We were excited because it was my first major league game,” he said. “And I was doubly excited because I was pitching against my favorite team when I was growing up, so I was a little more pumped up.“I don’t remember much because it was a long time ago,” Kuzava, 89, added.Perhaps best known for inducing Jackie Robinson to hit a bases-loaded pop-up that a sprinting Billy Martin caught to secure the Yankees’ 1952 World Series title against the Dodgers in 1952, Kuzava would appear to be a natural choice to throw out the ceremonial first ball when the new League Park is dedicated this year. DiBiasio said Indians players would visit regularly to run clinics, stage home run-hitting contests and lead fantasy camps.Gracing the arches of the old facade will be nine murals recently painted by Jerome White, a high school art teacher in Cleveland Heights. Six of the murals depict major leaguers who played at League Park before the game was integrated. One shows a catcher, Quincy Trouppe, who went on to manage the 1945 Negro leagues champion Buckeyes and played briefly for the Indians in 1952. Another portrays Satchel Paige, a pitcher for the Indians in 1948 and 1949, who reached the Hall of Fame for his exploits in the Negro leagues.The last painting shows a man placing a baseball in a child’s glove. The man is White and the child is his 5-year-old son, Solomon. The ball bears the word “tradition.”Cleveland is finally doing its part to honor the tradition of League Park."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/soccer/rooney-and-ronaldinho-come-of-age.html,"LONDON — At what age do extraordinarily gifted individuals grow into their talents and become leaders on their national teams?The question, and hopefully a hint of the answer, might be witnessed at Wembley Stadium in London on Wednesday. England plays Brazil. It is a prestige friendly, commemorating the 150th anniversary of the world’s oldest soccer association, the English F.A., and involves the country (Brazil) that has produced the best record in history.Emerging players like Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere and Santos’s Neymar have the opportunity to showcase their ability to become part of their national teams as they gear up for the 2014 World Cup.We expect signs from them that they belong to the future. There are enormous expectations upon Neymar, in particular, because he is blessed — or is it burdened — with being constantly touted as the next Pelé, the next Messi.In fact, he is a 21-year-old, a peacock of many fine feathers, but only an extravagant beginner in the fame game.Neymar, together with Oscar and Lucas Moura, are embryonic talents being rushed toward the tumultuous demand of trying to do in 2014 what, remarkably, no Brazilians have done before.They are charged with winning the World Cup on their soil. Brazil has claimed the world championship often enough, but never at home.When Brazil switched its coach last November and recalled Luiz Felipe Scolari to the role, accompanied by Carlos Alberto Parreira as technical director, the nation was signaling a retro approach.“Big Phil” Scolari had the good sense to walk away from the national team responsibility after he had managed the side that won the 2002 World Cup in Yokohama, Japan. Parreira had won it, too, as coach in 1994, but then failed to repeat that success.The pressure is on them to get it right this time, or else face the wrath of 190 million Brazilians.So it is intriguing that, alongside Neymar and Oscar and Lucas Moura, the head Coach Scolari brings back his playmaker from 2002 — a smiley Ronaldinho — and a seemingly born-again Júlio César.Neither is too old to come back. At 33, César is performing with all his former agility and confidence for his struggling English club, Queens Park Rangers. A month before his 33rd birthday, and seven years after he was seen as the best player on earth, Ronaldinho was recalled by Scolari.Ronaldinho himself had ushered in Lionel Messi at Barcelona. He had literally handed the then-17-year-old débutant the ball to score his first goals, and then, with his thirst for the game and the glory seemingly waning, Ronaldinho moved on, and then down in the pecking order of fame.It was as if he grew bored with the wonder of his own skills, tired of the acclaim, distracted by the good life and the night life that his wealth and his hangers-on offered him.Scolari, though, thinks there is life, and perhaps ambition, yet in Ronaldinho.His recall to Scolari’s first game back has polarized opinion in Brazil. Some take it at face value and see it as a returning coach picking a player who knows his methods, who knows how to express himself within the order that the coach demands and who perhaps knows how to pass on to youngsters when the moment is right to showboat during a performance.Others speculate that the old fox Scolari has selected Ronaldinho in the expectation that Ronaldinho’s limitations will be exposed and he can be done with the polemic once and for all.I doubt that second, cynical suggestion. Scolari is wily, for sure, but this time around, the time and opportunities to experiment are short. The coach goes so far as to say that Ronaldinho and Neymar are the two most gifted men around, and if the elder man can show the younger one the right time and place and moment to let imagination do the unexpected, then Brazil is the winner.Ronaldinho has wasted some of his prime, but in effect the coach is telling him that now he has the opportunity to be responsible for his God-given talent.Responsibility also might be dawning on England’s most accomplished forward, Wayne Rooney.Rooney is between Neymar and Ronaldinho in age. He is 27, the perfect time when a player’s physical capacity gels with experience accrued along the way.He is not, and never could be, a showman like Ronaldinho. But from the age of 3, people have indulged in him because he clearly had athletic gifts beyond the norm.Rooney also had, and still has, traces of street-smart irascibility. He is built like an ox, but prone to waywardness, to flashes of temper, to being easily ill-advised. It was just 21/2 years ago, in October 2010, when Rooney and his advisers tried to threaten the authority of Manchester United’s veteran manager, Alex Ferguson.They wanted, and got, the pay raise that made Rooney the best-remunerated player at Old Trafford. They implied that they had sought a move because United no longer matched his ambitions for trophies.Ferguson not only called Rooney’s bluff by going public with the ultimatum, he went out last summer and bought the best striker in English soccer, the Dutchman Robin van Persie.How would Rooney respond to no longer being the automatic focal point of United’s attacks? To not being the main striker? To sharing the limelight, the tag of being the highest-paid player? In short, was Rooney ready to be a team player, at times a support to a striker so lauded at his previous club (Arsenal) that he came with the aura of being the outstanding match-winner in their league?The answer, which Ferguson already knew, is that Rooney is, with every fiber he possesses, a winner. Away from his agent, he exists just to play soccer before he retreats to family life.The stardom that threw him years ago, and the petulance, are now under control. He is scoring again, but he is just as happy to sublimate himself energetically to the needs of his team.Talent is a given. Responsibility is something else. Rooney, Ronaldinho and responsibility might be the new three R’s of soccer."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/soccer/liverpool-game-is-part-of-a-match-fixing-investigation.html,"After a European police agency revealed that its investigation into widespread fixing of soccer matches included a Champions League game played in England in the past few years, fans and news media members paged through old results to try to guess which game was tainted. Did it involve Manchester United? Manchester City? Chelsea?By Tuesday, the frenzy died down. Debrecen, a Hungarian team, confirmed on its Web site that UEFA, the governing body of European soccer, had investigated two of its Champions League matches from 2009 — including one in England, against Liverpool at Anfield.A Danish newspaper, Ekstra Bladet, reported Monday that Debrecen’s goalkeeper, Vukasin Poleksic, is said to have been paid to ensure that there were more than two goals scored in the match. No Liverpool players were said to be involved.Oddly enough, if Poleksic was trying to tilt the match toward more goals, he was far from successful. Liverpool won by the score of 1-0. Liverpool had six other shots on goal saved in the match and hit the crossbar once.Poleksic is also believed to have fixed a second Debrecen match later in that season’s tournament against the Italian team Fiorentina. The statement on Debrecen’s Web site noted that Poleksic was suspended in 2010 only for failing to report that he had been approached by fixers — not because he had actually fixed either match.Liverpool officials told British reporters that they had not been contacted by anyone from UEFA regarding the game. A spokesman for Europol, the agency that conducted the 19-month investigation, did not respond to requests for comment.Europol has deemed suspicious nearly 700 matches worldwide over the past few years, it reported Monday, ranging from low-level domestic matches to World Cup qualifiers.Jurgen Klinsmann, a former star for Germany and the current coach of the United States national team, noted that he played for Monaco in the French league when another French team, Olympique Marseille, forfeited its league title because of a bribery scandal.“To FIFA, go in there and clean it up, with no compromises at all,” Klinsmann said Tuesday in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, where he is preparing the American team for Wednesday’s World Cup qualifier. “If there is proof, at least, go in there and find it all out and punish the people that are involved in it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/baseball/report-links-ryan-braun-to-florida-clinic-under-scrutiny-by-baseball.html,"For the second time in a week, a high-profile baseball player has been cited in documents linked to a shuttered anti-aging clinic that is under investigation for the distribution of performance-enhancing drugs.Yahoo Sports reported on Tuesday night that the name of the Milwaukee Brewers slugger Ryan Braun is on three records from the clinic, including one that appears to show Braun owed the Miami-area facility $20,000 to $30,000.In another document, the Web site said, there are multiple mentions of a lawyer who helped Braun avoid being suspended for 50 games last year after he had tested positive for having an elevated level of testosterone. The report also noted that there were no drug notations next to Braun’s name, as there were in documents that emerged last week in Miami New Times.Those documents linked a half-dozen major leaguers to the clinic, Biogenesis, and its owner, Anthony Bosch, and to the use of performance enhancers. The most prominent of those players was Alex Rodriguez, who was listed 16 times in what were described as clinic ledgers, with various drugs mentioned in some of those entries.Rodriguez has since denied having a relationship with Bosch or being treated by him.Braun issued his own denial on Tuesday night, saying in a written statement that during the course of preparing for the appeal of his positive test last year, “my attorneys, who were previously familiar with Tony Bosch, used him as a consultant.” He said Bosch answered questions for his lawyers about testosterone levels and the possibilities of tampering with urine samples.“There was a dispute over compensation for Bosch’s work, which is why my lawyer and I are listed under ‘moneys owed’ and not on any other list,” Braun said. “I have nothing to hide and have never had any other relationship with Bosch. I will fully cooperate with any inquiry into this matter.”Bosch is not a licensed physician in Florida, where he has lived for much of his life, and it’s unclear where he went to college or what medical expertise he has. According to a person with knowledge of the matter, Bosch’s name was never cited by Braun’s side during the appeal process.Last February, a baseball arbitrator ruled that Braun could not be suspended because there were chain-of-custody questions surrounding his urine samples.As a result, Braun became the first player in the sport to successfully appeal a positive test. Still, he played the 2012 season with something of a stigma, although that did not prevent him from again producing strong numbers — 41 home runs, 112 runs batted in, a .319 batting average. Now the question is what problems this new disclosure may create for him.The Yahoo report added that the Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli and Baltimore Orioles third baseman Danny Valencia were also mentioned in the documents they examined, but that like Braun’s listing, theirs did not have notations about drug use. A career backup with the Yankees, Cervelli figures to compete for more playing time this year with the departure of Russell Martin to the Pittsburgh Pirates.Cervelli denied any wrongdoing in a Twitter message he posted Tuesday night.“Following my foot injury in March 2011 I consulted with a number of experts, including the Biogenesis clinic, for legal ways to aid my rehab and recovery,” the message said. “I purchased supplements I am certain were not prohibited by MLB.”As more names of players emerged in connection with the clinic, investigators for baseball continued efforts to get their hands on the documents and attempt to confirm the information contained in them.A Miami New Times editor said in a telephone message on Tuesday that the newspaper had met with Major League Baseball officials and was considering whether to share the documents it has. A spokesman for baseball declined to comment on the matter.However, it is known that baseball officials believe that obtaining the records could significantly help them as they try to build potential cases against the major leaguers so far linked to the clinic — Rodriguez, Gio Gonzalez, Bartolo Colon, Melky Cabrera, Nelson Cruz, Yasmani Grandal and now Braun, Cervelli and Valencia.Colon, Cabrera and Grandal all were suspended last year for positive drug tests.Braun may draw particular scrutiny from baseball officials because they were angered that he evaded punishment last year on what they viewed as a technicality. Their suspicions of Braun have been heightened because the substance that he tested positive for in the fall of 2011 — an elevated level of testosterone — is the same one that subsequently led to the suspensions for Colon, Grandal and Cabrera.Now all four have been linked to the Bosch clinic by various documents — as have two others, a teammate of Braun’s at the University of Miami and a trainer for the university who has worked with Braun.Baseball is also mindful that when Braun appealed his positive drug test, he was required to provide detailed information, including the names of doctors and others he consulted for medical reasons. If baseball’s investigators were to uncover evidence that Braun was treated by Bosch at some point and did not disclose it during his appeal, he could be suspended for lying. However, no player has ever been suspended on those grounds since baseball, in 2004, instituted penalties for the use of performance enhancers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/olympics/nbcs-2014-olympic-broadcasts-to-begin-a-day-early.html,"NBC Universal’s love of the Olympics is well known. It has carried all the Winter and Summer Games since 2000.In 2011, it agreed to pay $4.38 billion to show the four Olympics from 2014 to 2020.And on Tuesday, the network said it would begin its Winter Olympics broadcast next February a day before the opening ceremony, with a prime-time broadcast from Sochi, Russia, that will feature two new events — team figure skating and slopestyle snowboarding — as well as women’s freestyle moguls.NBC said it would be the first time a broadcaster in the United States had started its prime-time programming ahead of the opening ceremony.“It’s a great way to jump-start the Olympics,” Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Sports Group, said during a news conference.The opportunity to add the extra night on Thursday, Feb. 6, was made possible with the International Olympic Committee’s addition of 12 events to the Winter Games program, which prompts an 18th day of competition.Lazarus said that the network’s rating and viewership for the added night would not be included in its cumulative 17-night performance, in part because there were no comparisons to past Olympics. It is possible that Olympic programming the night before the opening ceremony will draw a favorable rating. But if it is disappointing, NBC will not have to add it to its overall rating.All the sports events from Sochi will be shown live at NBCOlympics.com, and more than half the events, including every United States hockey game and curling match, will be shown live somewhere amid NBC’s cluster of broadcast and cable networks.But the nine-hour time difference between Sochi and the United States’ Eastern time zone means that the prime-time broadcasts will be shown on a delay.One result of NBC’s research from the 2012 London Summer Games was that carrying Olympic events live digitally helped to build, rather than to diminish, the prime-time audience even if viewers had already watched the contests on computers, smartphones or tablets.“The more content out there, the more prime-time viewing,” said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics.Lazarus said that he was hopeful that the N.H.L., whose games are carried by NBC, would agree to send its players to Sochi.“They’re a global league with many players from Russia,” he said, “and they have a TV partner that knows how to manage their product.”Lazarus said he expected NBC to make a profit at the Sochi Games. NBC earned a small profit from the London Olympics after early predictions of a loss as high as $200 million."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/golf/cal-mens-golf-team-plays-and-pays-own-way-to-top.html,"TUCSON — The spring semester started at the University of California the week before the Arizona Intercollegiate, which presented a problem for two of the top players on the Bears’ No. 1-ranked men’s golf team.Brandon Hagy and Joël Stalter wanted to take an improvisation and leadership course, offered through the Haas School of Business. They attended the first week of the classes but couldn’t make the first class of the second week because they were at The Golf Club of Vistoso in Tucson, trying to help the Bears to their sixth team victory in six starts.Students who miss any of the improvisation and leadership classes in the first three weeks of the semester are automatically dropped. The Cal coach, Steve Desimone, whose career has been a case study in improvisation and leadership, sent an e-mail appeal to the professor to make an exception for Hagy and Stalter, to no avail.For the better part of four decades, Desimone has been devoted to putting the student back in student-athlete. He has succeeded at Cal despite receiving no direct funding from the university, turning the lack of financial support into a golden opportunity to fix a college model he considered broken.The team’s budget for coaching salaries, scholarships, recruiting and travel comes entirely through charity events and fund-raising and endowment drives. As Desimone darted from hole to hole in a golf cart last week, monitoring his players’ progress and delivering sandwiches, snacks and suggestions on club selection during the final round, he kept returning to this classroom defeat.The professor’s refusal to budge weighed more heavily on Desimone than did the Bears’ first loss of the school year, a third-place finish behind New Mexico and Texas Christian in the 54-hole event.“Isn’t the essence of teaching finding a way to help the best students?” Desimone said. “When you have special kids like these, it kills you when they can’t find a way to make this work.”Stalter, who is from France, finished as the tournament co-medalist with his teammate Michael Kim, which at least provided Desimone with his punch line: Who needs a leadership course when you are the leader of the pack?“Part of the way we get past life’s difficulties is by finding the humor in them,” Desimone said.Desimone, a 64-year-old married father of two, was on the Cal basketball team in the late 1960s, an experience that afforded him a window into the murkier side of college athletics. He said some of the best and brightest football and basketball stars were either unprepared or unmotivated to carry their academic weight.“I swore I’d never get involved in intercollegiate athletics, that it was the dirtiest thing going,” said Desimone, whose disillusionment with the political and social unrest at Berkeley in the late 1960s led him to drop out of college and enroll in the Navy.Desimone returned to Cal in 1972 and completed his double major in physical education and history, then earned his master’s degree in physical education. He accepted a job as the athletic director and basketball coach at the College Preparatory School in Oakland, an institution geared toward high-achieving students.In November 1979, Desimone was approached to coach the Cal golf team. It was a club sport after having been dropped as an intercollegiate program the previous spring by Dave Maggard, the athletic director at the time.The pitch to Desimone revolved around returning the sport to varsity status. He said he was inclined to reject the offer, but in the week he was given to mull the decision, a vision took root in his mind. What if he were able to bring the College Preparatory School’s focus on academics and embrace of athletics to Cal?“That became the challenge, to be the beacon on the hill,” Desimone said. “I wanted to build a program based on honesty and integrity and academic excellence.”He started as a volunteer coach with a $2,500 budget, which he quickly managed to double not long after joining forces with Frank Brunk, a well-connected former Cal football player.In a telephone interview, Brunk recalled their initial meeting in February 1980. He knew very little about Desimone beyond that he had played basketball at Cal.“I told him I’d like to see the sport get back in the athletic department, but I don’t want to participate in a pre-professional golf program,” Brunk said. Shortly thereafter, Brunk held a fund-raising tournament at his home course, Orinda Country Club, which featured about four dozen golfers and raised more than $5,000. The success of the event, now in its 33rd year, led Brunk and Desimone to form the Cal Golf Committee, a group of roughly two dozen volunteers that raises money for the program.In 1982, men’s golf was reinstated as an intercollegiate sport after demonstrating it could be self-sufficient. Desimone kept his job at the College Preparatory School until 1988, when he became Cal’s full-time coach at $35,000 a year (his salary has since tripled).Under Desimone, the team now has a budget of $525,000, culled in part from the interest from a $3.75 million endowment raised by Desimone and company and managed by university regents. They have enough money to finance three scholarships (the maximum allowed under N.C.A.A. rules is four and a half).Cal has produced 13 all-Americans and 17 all-American scholars, capturing the N.C.A.A. team title in 2004 and coming tantalizingly close last year, advancing to the team semifinals.Reached by telephone, Maggard said: “I think it’s great what he’s done. That was the intent all along, for the so-called Olympic sports to become endowed. Were all the golf people happy about it? No. But now you see where they are.”Four golfers on this year’s team, including Hagy and the United States Amateur finalist Michael Weaver, are on the watch list for the Ben Hogan Award, given to the nation’s top male college golfer. What makes Desimone prouder is that three of his players are in the prestigious Haas business school, and that his team’s cumulative grade-point average is above 3.1On one of the finishing holes at The Golf Club of Vistoso, Desimone caught up with Kim, a sophomore from the San Diego area. Kim asked Desimone where the team stood in relation to New Mexico and T.C.U., and Desimone brought up a golf stat program on his smartphone. He lamented that it was behind in its updates and Kim brightened, as if Desimone had switched on a light bulb.“Maybe that’s my next project,” Kim said enthusiastically. “A little cheaper, little better golf stat program.”A few days later, Kim rose to No. 1 in the collegiate rankings, another first for Desimone and the Cal program he created virtually from scratch."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/sports/hockey/tavares-plans-to-take-the-islanders-back-to-the-top.html,"UNIONDALE, N.Y. — It says everything about the makeup of Islanders center John Tavares that he believes they can reach the playoffs for the first time in six seasons, despite all the evidence to the contrary.“If that’s not what we’re thinking and playing for, we shouldn’t be here,” said Tavares, 22, the first overall pick in the 2009 N.H.L. entry draft. “That’s our goal. It’s always going to be our goal.”How realistic that aim may be could become clearer after the lightly regarded Islanders (4-4-1) play the highly regarded but slow-starting Rangers (4-5) Thursday night for the first time this season.Even if the Islanders sustain their third consecutive defeat, do not expect that to discourage Tavares.“He wants to win the Stanley Cup with the Islanders,” said left wing Matt Moulson, a close friend and linemate of Tavares. “He’s not the type of guy who bails ship. He wants to win here.”Tavares demonstrated that by signing a six-year extension worth $33 million last September, even though the Islanders last won a playoff series in 1993 and play in Nassau Coliseum, a hopelessly outdated arena. Tavares said it was a “no-brainer” when he decided to make a long-term commitment to the Islanders a month before the team announced it would move to Barclays Center in Brooklyn in 2015.“I want to try to be part of bringing back the Islanders to what they once were,” he said. “To be a part of that would be an awesome thing to do with these guys.”The Islanders packed star power — think Denis Potvin, Mike Bossy and Bryan Trottier, among others — when they hoisted the Stanley Cup four consecutive seasons from 1980-83. And now, in Tavares, they have the perfect player to build around.“I think he can be one of the best players in the world,” Islanders Coach Jack Capuano said. “He takes a lot of pride in his conditioning, in his skating. He’s always working on his skills. He’s just a perfectionist in how he wants to get things done.”Tavares addressed his only significant weakness by improving his skating last season, and he reached the All-Star Game for the first time. He has four goals and seven assists through nine games after producing gains each of his first three years. His point total increased from 54 in 2009-10 to 81 last season, when he recorded 31 goals and 50 assists. During the lockout, he played for Bern in Switzerland, collecting 17 goals and 25 assists in 28 games. (He is still in the top 10 in scoring in the Swiss league this season.) According to Tavares, he spent much of the off-season refining his shooting.“Most of the lethal goal-scorers today are guys who get off their shot really quick,” he said. “I tried to work on my release a lot and shoot from every angle and position.”Tavares already compares to elite players in his ability to raise the level of teammates.“I coached Gretzky, so I’ve seen the greatest passer ever to play,” Barry Melrose, an ESPN analyst, said. “The great passers see guys and it’s like the old saying, It’s almost like he’s got eyes in the back of his head. John will make passes where you wonder how he saw the guy open.”Moulson, 29, and Tavares are from Mississauga, Ontario. They began honing their skills together when Tavares was 13 or 14. As well as the two know each other, Moulson is still amazed by Tavares’s ability to understand what will happen on the ice before it occurs.“Some of the great players, they see the game in slow motion,” Moulson said. “He definitely anticipates plays. He sees what he wants to do two or three plays down the road.”Moulson has learned the best results come when he simply follows his center’s lead.“He creates; I just read off him,” Moulson said. “It’s impossible to predict what he is going to do every time because he pulls some things out of his hat that I would never think of.”What draws Moulson to Tavares most has nothing to do with shooting or passing. It has everything to do with loyalty and friendship. He and his wife, Alicia, chose Tavares to be the godfather of their 6-month-old daughter, Mila.Melrose said he believed Tavares was just beginning to fulfill his potential.“With his vision and his shot and the way he reads plays,” Melrose said, “the sky is the limit for this kid.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/sports/golf/for-james-hahn-and-si-woo-kim-pebble-beach-pro-am-is-an-opportunity.html,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — They are two South Korean-born golfers whose pursuit of the American dream has brought them to the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, but from there the stories of James Hahn and Si Woo Kim sharply diverge.Hahn is a 31-year-old rookie who was raised in the Bay Area; graduated from Cal in 2003, the same year he turned professional; and was married last year. He earned his PGA Tour card by finishing fifth on the Web.com tour, and has made the most of his first four starts, posting two top-16 finishes and cracking the top 30 of the FedEx Cup standings.Kim is a 17-year-old who turned professional last year and earned his PGA Tour playing privileges with a top-25 finish at last December’s qualifying school. He cannot join the tour until his 18th birthday in June, and is playing his first tour event after receiving a sponsor’s exemption.When the tournament gets under way Thursday at Pebble Beach, Spyglass Hill and Monterey Peninsula Country Club, Hahn will do his best not to try too hard, having learned that he plays his best when he minimizes his expectations.For Kim, there can be no minimizing the importance of his debut on the PGA Tour. He needs a high finish to secure his next start. As Kim made his way around Spyglass on Wednesday in his sixth round of golf in six days on the tournament courses, his manager, Suk Oh, said: “He’s not nervous now but he said he’ll get nervous when he gets to the first tee tomorrow. It’s his debut event, so he has to play well.”At the end of the West Coast swing, the rookie priority list will be reshuffled in the tour’s version of soccer’s system of promotion and relegation. Hahn, because of his fast start, will be nicely positioned to get into events the rest of the year. Kim, because of his youth, has no status. He can gain entry into no more than 12 tour events through sponsor exemptions or top-10 finishes until after his birthday on June 28.Kim, who is temporarily based in La Quinta, Calif., and is practicing at PGA West, asked for a sponsor’s exemption to the Humana Challenge, held at PGA West, and was turned down. He was in Arizona, preparing to try to qualify for the Waste Management Phoenix Open last week, when he found out he had gained the exemption here. He traveled the next day to California so he could play each of the courses two times before the tournament began.If Hahn were the commissioner, he wouldn’t make Kim wait to become a tour member.“If you’re good enough to compete against the best in the world, it doesn’t matter how old or young you are,” Hahn said. “The fact that he’s doing it at 17 is incredible.”At the same time, Hahn said he understood the philosophy behind setting an age minimum for tour membership. “The tour needs to protect its players more as people than commodities,” he said. “You don’t want to see kids being pressed to give up the option of attending college, of getting a higher level of education, to pursue money.”College golf did not end well for Hahn, who completed his undergraduate degree in American Studies. He quit the Cal team his senior year because of a lack of playing time. “I went the next four years walking around with a chip on my shoulder,” he said.After a year playing in minitour events, Hahn quit the game and earned his real estate license and sold women’s shoes at Nordstrom’s. Little could he have imagined back when he was helping women squeeze their feet into designer pumps that one day he would dance his way into the public consciousness.It happened on Sunday at the Phoenix Open on No. 16, the par-3 party hole. After draining a 20-foot birdie putt, Hahn broke out into a 13-second “Gangnam Style” dance. With his gyrations and gesticulations, it was as if his body had been invaded by the Korean hip-hop artist Psy. Hahn, who finished in a tie for 16th, said the dance was not premeditated, that the fun-loving atmosphere caused him to tap into his “inner child.”As of Wednesday afternoon, the PGA Tour video of Hahn’s dance had received more than 167,000 views, including a couple by Hahn, who described watching himself as “an out-of-body experience.”“I still can’t believe that was me,” he said Wednesday with a laugh. “It’s pretty funny, not only to make birdie on 16 in the final round but to celebrate and do something so over the top it ends up being a crowd pleaser. I thought it might be so over the top people might say how humiliating, how embarrassing to the sport of golf.”As his dance was unfolding, one of the announcers on the PGA Tour video could be heard joking that the tour commissioner, Tim Finchem, would be summoning Hahn into his office.  Most people, it seemed, were more impressed than put off by Hahn’s moves.“I for one loved it,” John Cook, an 11-time tour winner, said Tuesday during a Golf Channel teleconference. He added, “I applaud the kid for just having the guts to do that in front of all those people.”Kim saw the clip of Hahn’s dance on Tuesday and loved it. “He said it was really funny,” Oh said, “but at the same time he felt proud of him for giving a laugh to the fans.”Finally, on Thursday, Kim gets his first chance to entertain the fans. He hopes to make the most of it."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/sports/baseball/francisco-cervelli-report-raise-questions-on-yankees-catching.html,"The Yankees’ thin catching corps was left more vulnerable when it was revealed Tuesday that Francisco Cervelli, one of the two leading candidates to be the team’s starting catcher, had visited a Miami clinic under investigation for dispensing performance-enhancing drugs.Cervelli said on his Twitter account that he took no banned substances and was only seeking “legal ways” to heal a foot injury he sustained in March 2011.Yankees General Manager Brian Cashman said he could not discuss the issue because it was in the hands of Major League Baseball, but he said nothing had happened in the last 24 hours that would make him rethink the Yankees’ plans at catcher.“We have Cervelli and Chris Stewart, with Austin Romine on the outside looking in,” he said.Because Cervelli has denied any wrongdoing, any potential punishment would be imposed only after an exhaustive investigation, the results of which would probably be fought and appealed. That process could conceivably take months or years.In the meantime, Romine could easily surge to the fore, leaving behind both Cervelli and Stewart. Last year, Cervelli was behind Russell Martin, the starter, and Stewart on the depth chart. Martin signed with the Pittsburgh Pirates for two years and $17 million after the Yankees declined to give him a two-year contract.Based on last year, Cervelli goes into spring training in second place. But Stewart, who took the job of primary backup from Cervelli last season when Cervelli was relegated to Class AAA for the entire minor league season, has impressed the pitching staff, the pitching coach Larry Rothschild and Manager Joe Girardi. Cervelli was not called up until September, when he had only two plate appearances.Both Stewart and Cervelli are considered good defensive catchers. Stewart hit .241 last season; his career high is .243.The Yankees hope that Romine will take over the job midway through the season. He missed most of last season with a lingering back injury. But he appears to have greater potential than either of the players ahead of him."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/sports/in-romanias-top-hockey-team-ethnic-hungarians-find-a-strong-voice.html,"MIERCUREA CIUC, Romania — A city of 38,000 on a plateau in eastern Transylvania, Miercurea Ciuc is famous for three things: its status as one of Romania’s coldest places; its brewery, where the country’s Ciuc beer is produced; and its ice hockey team, which has won the last six Romanian league championships.But the name on the front of the team’s blue-and-white hockey jerseys is not Miercurea Ciuc. It is Szekelyfold, the Hungarian word for the Szekely Land, a former province of the Kingdom of Hungary. Printed on the ice at the Vakar Lajos rink is the Hungarian name of the team: Hoki Sport Club Csikszereda. The fans at the team’s home games chant the Szekely Land anthem in Hungarian.The Szekely Land, named for a warrior tribe that dates to the Middle Ages, is a Hungarian-dominated area of Romania, covering three counties in the center of the country. The roughly 1.2 million Hungarians represent Romania’s largest ethnic minority, about 6 percent of the country’s population. The fall of the Austro-Hungarian empire after World War I marooned millions of Hungarians in what is now Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Serbia. The Szekely found themselves cut off and subject to a policy of assimilation, including heavy restrictions on the use of their language, under the former communist leader Nicolae Ceausescu.But for the past two decades, the region’s ethnic Hungarians have been campaigning for greater autonomy, with Hoki Sport Club Csikszereda in the vanguard. Romania may be a soccer country, but in Csikszereda, ice hockey is the only game in town.The hockey club functions much like the storied Spanish soccer club Barcelona, which kept alive the flame of Catalan nationalism under the repressive rule of General Franco.“I can say that this sports club, this ice hockey team, represents the Szekely,” said Papp Elod, the club’s former president, who is now a local politician. “We like to say that ice hockey represents our history as all our ancestors were warriors, and ice hockey needs warriors. There are very few Romanians who play for our club.”Standing rinkside, Timo Lahtinen, the team’s 65-year-old Finnish coach, said, “Everyone in this town plays hockey and talks about hockey, this is the hockey center of Romania.”Lahtinen paused, then corrected himself, “Actually, Hungary.”The success of Csikszereda had caused a problem within Romanian ice hockey. The Romanian national team is almost entirely made up of ethnic Hungarians who play for Csikszereda.“The whole national team is only my players, and everyone speaks Hungarian,” Lahtinen said.This anomaly reached a critical point during a 2011 game between Romania and Hungary in Miercurea Ciuc. After the game, almost all of Romania’s players joined with their opponents to sing the Hungarian anthem.“Some of the paparazzi caught it, and it was a big scandal,” said Attila Goga, Csikszereda’s captain, who has played for the Romanian national team for a decade but holds dual Romanian-Hungarian citizenship. “It’s a little bit strange, but I can see that, too. They don’t understand our situation here.”There was only one anthem Goga was going to sing.“Everyone here is Hungarian,” he said. “I feel Hungarian. From a little child I spoke Hungarian. We learn Romanian, too, but Hungarian is my mother language.”The fall of communism gave some Hungarian minorities the chance to push for greater cultural and political freedoms after years of repression. A move by the Hungarian government in 2010 to grant joint citizenship to its former subjects across Eastern and Central Europe has emboldened old allegiances.Laszlo Tokes, a former vice president of the European Parliament and one of Romania’s most prominent Hungarian politicians, is campaigning for full Hungarian autonomy within Romania, centered on the Szekley Land, with sports playing an important part.“Our culture was oppressed,” Tokes said. “So it happened in sport. In Csikszereda that is why it is so important, the role of Hungarian sport life. Hockey sport because it is the people of Hungarian identity. Sport sometimes takes this function and role in a minority.”Tokes, now a bishop, was a hero of the 1989 revolution that overthrew Ceausescu. When Romania’s secret police attempted to arrest him, his congregation resisted, sparking nationwide protest that brought down the regime.Tokes called Romanians “very good friends,” but said they did not accept his people as Hungarian.“Sometimes we are called Romanians speaking Hungarian,” he said. “That is not true. We are full Hungarians in the original sense of the word.”He added: “Even if we lived on the moon, we would be Hungarian. Even if we are living in Transylvania, Romania, we consider ourselves Hungarians.”Hoki Sport Club Csikszereda has attracted local businessmen and politicians promoting the Szekely Land. Although its home rink was built in the 1970s, it is well maintained, with a hotel next door to accommodate traveling teams. Inside, the walls are covered with advertisements from local businesses in Hungarian; Ciuc beer is featured prominently. A trophy cabinet heaves with the club’s many honors.But in Bucharest, the Romanian capital, ice hockey has seen better days. The city’s main rink was partly flooded. On a recent day, a young girl practiced figure skating routines around patches of water pooled on the surface. Stray dogs stalked the perimeter. One stray managed to entangle itself in the hockey nets, until it chewed through the ropes to break free.“Miercurea Ciuc has a local political and social interest,” said Marius Gliga, the technical director of the Romanian Ice Hockey Federation. “It is a small town. If they want to be seen by the rest of the cities, they have to show something. And they choose sport. The political men in the area use this team to promote themselves.”Before the revolution, Bucharest was the power center of Romanian ice hockey. Romania’s golden age was in the 1970s and ’80s, when it qualified for the 1976 and 1980 Olympics. Back then, Steaua Bucharest, the team of the army, was the dominant squad.“They used to take from the best players and allowed them to practice rather than have military service, which was good for the players,” said Gliga, who played center for Steaua his entire career. “They had two years of practice, which was very good for them at 18 to 20. That was good for the national team.”But the abolition of national service, the supremacy of soccer in Bucharest and the influx of money into Csikszereda from businessmen and politicians eager to further the Szekely Land’s cause switched the balance of power.Now Steaua is a shadow of its former self, and Bucharest provided little more than the office for the federation and the officials for most matches, including the Romanian Cup final in late December between Csikszereda and Corona Brasov, a team that also hails from Transylvania but whose fans chant in Romanian.Csikszereda went ahead, 2-0, by the end of the second period, and it appeared that another piece of silverware was about to be added to its trophy cabinet.The Szekely flag was flying when the third period began, but it did not herald the coronation the home supporters had expected. Brasov stormed back, scoring three times in five minutes. When Csikszereda had a player sent to the penalty box with two minutes left, the match was effectively over. Brasov was crowned champion, the players celebrating wildly in front of their traveling fans.This time the Csikszereda fans chanted in Romanian, the language of the officials who had crammed into two cars and driven five hours from Bucharest to get there.“Thieves!” they shouted at the referees.“Peasants!” they chanted.“We’re Hungarian and the referees are always Romanian, so we always feel that Romanian referees aren’t fair when it comes to matches,” said Szikszai Laszlo, a 22-year-old fan of Csikszereda.As the Brasov team members passed the cup among themselves on the ice, Lahtinen stood on the sideline wondering how his team had lost the match. He said one of his players was suspended just a few minutes before the start of the match.“We were by far the best team and then I guess we got tired as they had more players,” he said.Csikszereda had lost the final, but the fans had still had the chance to see the club play for a seventh league championship in a row. The rink, and the team, remain a symbol of something bigger than ice hockey.“In the period of communism, local newspapers couldn’t write Csikszereda; you had to write Miercurea Ciuc,” Laszlo said. “Back then this place was a sanctuary. It was the only place where you could speak Hungarian freely. You can still feel that today to a certain level.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/sports/soccer/us-wilts-in-honduras-in-world-cup-qualifier.html,"SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras — The phrase was repeated like a mantra here this week: “Get the job done,” the American players said, until the words nearly lost their meaning.The United States men’s national team will try to carry that mentality through the final stage of regional World Cup qualification. It is a task easily within its ability. But it will require a workman’s attitude.On Wednesday afternoon, the work overwhelmed the United States, which lost, 2-1, against Honduras in their opening match of the final round of qualifying. Though the Americans struck first, they wilted quickly under the hot Central American sun, allowing a goal in each half to the delight of the tens of thousands of Honduran fans packed into Estadio Olímpico.The Americans have by no means botched the job. They need only to finish within the top three out of six teams to earn entrance to the World Cup in Brazil next summer, and they are still expected to do that. But before their next game — March 22 against Costa Rica in Commerce City, Colo. — they have received a taste of how labor-intensive the job will be.“You take a game like this, you digest it and you analyze the mistakes, talk about the mistakes they’ve done, and then you move forward,” Coach Jurgen Klinsmann said. “You’ll see a totally different team, hopefully, in the next game.”The American team is in transition, and the conditions Wednesday seemed to unnerve it. The air at kickoff was a steamy 85 degrees, the result of some gamesmanship from the Honduran federation, which scheduled the game for midafternoon to sap its opponents’ energy. Throughout, the buzz of horns was incessant, like an emergency exit door left ajar. And the grass field, set inside an oval of barbed wired, looked plush to a fault.The Hondurans, known as Los Catrachos, dictated the pace. Their passes were more purposeful, their dribbling more sophisticated, and they dominated possession.“It was hot, the grass was long, it was tough on our legs,” the American goalkeeper Tim Howard said. “But we still could find better ways to press them and make them cough up the ball like they did to us.”Even so, the United States scored first. In the 36th minute, midfielder Jermaine Jones shoveled a pass over the Honduran back line, sending it fluttering into the stride of forward Clint Dempsey, who lashed it gracefully out of the air and into the net from close range.But the Hondurans outshined Dempsey’s flash of skill four minutes later. After an errant corner kick, Maynor Figueroa directed the subsequent cross off his chest into a pocket of airspace behind defender Juan Carlos García. As defenders closed in, García left his feet and thumped a vicious, left-footed bicycle kick inside the left post. Beverages tossed from the upper deck created a celebratory downpour.Such party vibes and soaring decibel levels were established three hours before the match. By then, the dance music blaring from sets of stacked amplifiers was deafening, as were spirited shouts — “Un grito, Catrachos! Honduras, Honduras, Honduras!” — from the public address announcer.Fans on the concrete stands formed a bubbly sea of white and blue — save for a section of five rows near midfield, where a couple of dozen expatriates and traveling Americans sat, depositing a splotch of red — as young vendors wove between, selling bags of water, packs of gum and plantain chips.The party simmered into the second half, as neither team looked content to tie. Klinsmann paced the sideline nervously, making three quick attack-minded substitutions. But the American players looked winded.“They feed so much off their crowd and off emotion,” midfielder Michael Bradley said of the Honduran team. “I think we started to get pulled around a little bit, and they were able to find these little gaps and little seams between the lines.”The seams burst in the 79th minute, when midfielder Óscar García latched onto a through ball behind the American defense. As Howard charged aggressively from his line, García cut the ball back into the path of forward Jerry Bengtson, who slotted it into the open net. The goal immediately brought into question Klinsmann’s decision to start the inexperienced Omar Gonzalez at one of the center back positions, leaving the veteran Carlos Bocanegra on the bench.“He’s ready for the international level,” Klinsmann said of Gonzalez, “and the only way you’ll find that out is to give him a chance, to throw him in the cold water. I think he’s done well.”Klinsmann and his players did not seem panicked. But they looked weary as they began their trip back to the United States, nine games, a long tiring job, still ahead of them."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/sports/football/ahmad-bradshaw-and-chris-canty-cut-by-giants.html,"After a season in which they deteriorated from Super Bowl champions to a perplexing, uneven team unable to reach the playoffs, the Giants began making changes in earnest Wednesday with the release of running back Ahmad Bradshaw and defensive tackle Chris Canty.Bradshaw and Canty played important roles when the Giants defeated the New England Patriots in the 2012 Super Bowl, only to be slowed by injuries as the team struggled mightily late last season.Bradshaw, who turns 27 next month, scored the winning touchdown with 57 seconds left in that Super Bowl and ranks sixth on the team’s career rushing list with 4,232 yards. But he became less dependable and sat out numerous practices with a recurrence of foot problems that forced him to miss four games in 2011.Canty, 30, was part of a ferocious front four when the Giants rolled to that title, their second in four years. He missed the first six games last season as he recovered from knee surgery. He was also sidelined for the last game of the season after he injured his knee in a 33-14 road loss against the Baltimore Ravens.General Manager Jerry Reese, who cut linebacker Michael Boley, 30, on Tuesday, was effusive in praising Bradshaw for his attacking style.“Pound for pound, Bradshaw is one of the toughest football players that I’ve been around,” he said.Bradshaw is one of the finest draft choices in the franchise’s history, blossoming after being selected in the seventh round, 250th over all, in 2007. He became one of six Giants with at least 3,000 rushing yards and 1,000 receiving yards (1,087).“He is the epitome of line up and play,” Coach Tom Coughlin said. “Regardless of the circumstances, he’s going to give you everything he’s got.”With Bradshaw’s departure, the Giants will most likely count heavily on David Wilson, their first-round draft choice last year, who showed great promise but appeared raw.He displayed blistering speed in setting a franchise record with 1,533 kickoff-return yards while rushing for 358 yards and 4 touchdowns. His progress was slowed, though, by problems with ball security and pass protection.The Giants will also hope that Andre Brown, who ran for a team-high eight touchdowns, can fully recover from a fractured fibula he sustained on Nov. 25."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/sports/hockey/jt-miller-lifts-rangers-over-islanders.html," J. T. Miller, playing in his second N.H.L. game, gave an electrifying performance Thursday night, scoring two goals to lead the Rangers to a 4-1 victory over the Islanders at Madison Square Garden. Miller, 19, became the first Ranger to make his Garden debut with a multiple-goal game since Chris Kontos in 1983. He was also the youngest Ranger to have a multigoal game since Alex Kovalev scored a hat trick Dec. 27, 1992.Miller scored on his first shift, skating around defenseman Brian Strait and firing the puck between the legs of goalie Evgeni Nabokov at 1 minute 29 seconds. He tallied again on a power play at 18:11 of the second period to make the score 3-1. He used his speed to create a breakaway off a pass from Ryan McDonagh and once again shot the puck through Nabokov’s legs.Miller stood in the dressing room after the game wearing the Broadway Hat, the battered fedora given to the team’s most valuable player after every victory. Miller had not been aware of the hat or the tradition that began last season. “It’s a nice hat,” Miller said. “I look forward if we get a win the next game to passing it on to someone else.”He could have had a hat trick when McDonagh intercepted a pass and shot into an empty net with 2:08 left to play. Miller was on the ice, but McDonagh, startled to find the Islanders’ net vacant, did not think to pass. “I told him, ‘Good shot,’ ” Miller said. “I’m glad he didn’t miss the net there.” McDonagh said: “I don’t get too many of those looks as a defenseman. But I wish I could’ve given it to J. T.” Miller, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound center from East Palestine, Ohio, made an impressive debut Tuesday in a 3-1 loss at New Jersey, earning praise from Coach John Tortorella. He already performed on a big stage this season, playing for the United States team that won the gold medal at the world junior championship in Russia last month. He also had 8 goals and 20 points in 37 games with the Rangers’ American Hockey League affiliate in Connecticut this season and was chosen to play in the All-Star Game. On Thursday, he centered a line with Chris Kreider and the Rangers’ captain, Ryan Callahan, who returned after missing three games with a shoulder injury. Callahan mindfully retrieved the puck from the net after Miller’s first goal, gathering the keepsake for Miller, whose mother, grandmother and girlfriend attended the game and heard the crowd chant his name. “It’s a spark to see a guy come in his first two games and play the way he has,” Callahan said. Marian Gaborik made the score 2-0 at 14:04 of the first period.Before the game, Tortorella said he was upset with a player on his team who had five goals, and Gaborik was the only player who fit the description.Tortorella shuffled the lines to advantageous effect. The Gaborik-Brad Richards-Rick Nash line was broken up, with Taylor Pyatt taking Nash’s place. Nash moved to a line with Derek Stepan and Carl Hagelin. John Tavares scored for the Islanders (4-5-1), boosting his career output to 7 goals and 20 points in 18 games against the Rangers (5-5). Tortorella has complained about the Rangers’ inconsistency over the last few days, saying the 48-game season leaves no time for experimentation. On Thursday, he made Brian Boyle a healthy scratch after Boyle had played 174 consecutive games, a streak that started in 2009-10.Boyle scored 21 goals in 2010-11 and 11 last season, but this season he has had no goals and one assist in nine games, and was almost certainly someone Tortorella had in mind after the 3-1 loss to the Devils when he said some Rangers looked tentative, scared and careful.Asked if Boyle would learn anything from watching the game from the press box, Tortorella said:  “To be miserable, and to hope that he never puts me in this type of position again. He’s not playing, and I know he likes to play. And he will get another opportunity to play.” Boyle said:  “My whole body of work this year hasn’t been there. I don’t know what it is. It’s not reactive — it’s just a little too much thinking and not enough confidence.”Tortorella sounded a cautious note about Miller.   “I try to temper myself because I’m not sure where it’s going to go in two weeks,” Tortorella said. But he could not deny the quality of Miller’s performance. “I like the way he carries himself,” Tortorella said. “He’s got some good strut to his game.”  SLAP SHOTS The Rangers played a second straight game without defenseman Dan GiraRDI; the team said he was day to day with an undisclosed injury. ...

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/sports/hockey/coach-don-lucia-leads-minnesota-hockey-team-to-top-of-rankings.html,"MINNEAPOLIS — At precisely 1:27 p.m. Wednesday, Don Lucia, the Minnesota men’s hockey coach, skated onto the ice at Mariucci Arena and began writing on a dry-erase board hanging by the bench. Six players had already gathered by the blue line, on one knee leaning on their sticks, when Lucia blew his whistle two minutes later to summon the rest of the team.Lucia diagramed a drill and spoke while the players studied the board in silence. An equipment manager laid extra sticks against the glass on the bench with the lightest touch to avoid any distracting sound.Grant Potulny, a Gophers assistant who starred on Lucia’s 2002 and 2003 N.C.A.A. championship teams, said this was the Lucia he remembered — demanding, intense, commanding respect. Four years after a debilitating illness endangered Lucia’s career, and nearly two years after some Gopher fans wanted him fired for missing the N.C.A.A. tournament for a third consecutive season, Lucia has the Gophers back among the national elite.It took some doing. Lucia revamped the way the Gophers recruited and overhauled the coaching staff, including firing one of his best friends. It all worked. Last year the Gophers returned to the Frozen Four for the first time since 2005.With almost every key player from that team back, and the emergence of the freshman goalie Adam Wilcox, the Gophers (18-4-4) rank No. 1 in both national polls entering a Western Collegiate Hockey Association showdown series this weekend at St. Cloud State.“Talk about pressure,” said the Gopher women’s hockey coach Brad Frost, a friend of Lucia’s whose team is also ranked No. 1. “After having a couple of down years, and with everybody calling for his head, he came back strong. He’s done a tremendous job with that group.”Minnesota ranks above No. 8 St. Cloud even though the Huskies are 5 points ahead in the conference standings. Minnesota has two games in hand and a much better nonconference record (8-0) than the Huskies (3-5).Minnesota has been one of the nation’s premier programs for decades, winning three of its five N.C.A.A. titles in the 1970s under Herb Brooks, who coached the 1980 United States Olympic team and also coached in the N.H.L.Lucia, a Minnesota native who played defense at Notre Dame and coached at Alaska-Fairbanks and Colorado College, won the last two after taking over the Gophers in 1999.Though Lucia is one of 10 coaches in N.C.A.A. history with 600 or more victories (615-332-87 over all; 336-177-58 at Minnesota), and one of four to win back-to-back national titles, the team’s repeated failure to win a third championship annoyed a vocal segment of fans. Missing the N.C.A.A. tournament from 2008-9 through 2010-11 made things tougher, even though Lucia faced a serious medical problem.Around Christmas 2008, Lucia experienced facial numbness and severe headaches before receiving a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, an autoimmune disease that caused inflammatory cells to cluster in Lucia’s brain. Weekly steroid treatments ravaged Lucia, who kept the details private and missed only four games. The Gophers finished 17-13-7 that season and 18-19-2 the next, Lucia’s first losing record since 1991-92 at Alaska-Fairbanks. Lucia recovered but still feels residual numbness in his face and tongue.Even before Lucia’s illness, the Gophers kept losing talented underclassmen to the N.H.L. after one or two seasons, undermining continuity and depth. The 2005 N.H.L. collective bargaining agreement, which established a salary cap, led teams to poach college rosters for lower-paid talent. From 2006 to 2010, 16 underclassmen left for pro or major junior hockey, including Phil Kessel, Erik Johnson, Kyle Okposo and Nick Leddy.“Ultimately, put the blame on me,” Lucia said. “Kids were leaving sooner than they ever had before. We didn’t do a very good job of anticipating that was going to happen. You need to recruit some guys who are going to be four-year college players rather than two-year guys, because you’re not going to win with two-year guys. Getting sick at that time didn’t help, but I’m certainly not going to put the blame all on that.”Calls for Lucia’s ouster increased in 2011 after unranked Alaska-Anchorage swept the Gophers from the W.C.H.A. tournament in the first round. Joel Maturi, then the athletic director, said Lucia’s job was never in jeopardy. “Not with me,” he said. “Certainly with some fans.”Lou Nanne, a former Gophers captain and later a player, coach and general manager of the Minnesota North Stars, heard the same complaints. “I had guys calling me and going nuts, and I said, ‘Will you just relax?’ ” Nanne said. “You don’t win 600 games if you’re stupid.”Lucia addressed some criticism by firing his longtime assistant and friend John Hill and rehiring the former assistant Mike Guentzel to coach defensemen.“John was, in my opinion, in some ways, unfairly, the scapegoat,” Lucia said. “It wasn’t his fault. It was my fault. It was very difficult, probably the most difficult thing I’ve ever had to do.”From there, Lucia needed talent and continuity. He got it with the junior forwards Nick Bjugstad, Erik Haula and Zach Budish, all N.H.L. draftees, and the undrafted junior defenseman Nate Schmidt, who came back to try to win a national title. Schmidt leads Division I defensemen in scoring with 25 points, while Bjugstad, Haula and the sophomore Kyle Rau have combined for 37 goals and 47 assists.“This is not an easy place to coach,” Lucia said. “I always say this is the greatest job and the worst job all tied into one because of the expectation, which is good. All that goes into winning and losing. You have to have a very thick skin and continue to plod away.“There were a lot of people who didn’t want me to be here a couple of years ago. Fortunately, we had the good year last year to reinforce the decision to show some faith.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/sports/baseball/baseball-inquiries-about-banned-substances-raise-some-doubts.html,"For nearly a decade, as Major League Baseball has tried to solve its doping riddle, its investigators have repeatedly encountered vivid tales of star players using banned substances.Determining whether the accusations are true, however, and ultimately punishing the players has been a far more difficult task.As far back as 2001, a trainer who worked with the slugger Juan Gonzalez, then playing for the Cleveland Indians, told a security employee of the team that he provided players with steroids, making the admission after Canadian authorities found the substances in his luggage. But when the trainer, Angel Presinal, later met with investigators for George J. Mitchell, who was conducting an investigation into the use of steroids in the sport, he maintained that he never gave any players drugs.More recently, there was the Toronto-based Dr. Anthony Galea, whose assistant was stopped by American authorities at a border crossing in New York with a car containing human growth hormone. Several of baseball’s most high-profile players, including Alex Rodriguez, acknowledged they were treated by Galea. But the assistant and Galea never met with baseball’s investigators, and no player ended up in danger of being punished.Now, there is the case of Anthony Bosch and his Miami anti-aging clinic, which has emerged as the potential big break that baseball and its investigators have been seeking in their continuing efforts to combat the use of performance enhancers. Stars like Rodriguez, Ryan Braun and Melky Cabrera were named in Bosch’s handwritten notes, according to various reports, and the names continue to drip out, one by one.But as baseball investigators probe, they are also talking to, or seeking to talk to, some recent associates of Bosch who have doubts he had it in him to be at the nexus of a major doping scandal.“At the end of day, I don’t think Tony had the capabilities or the client list to be able to do it,” said Jorge Jaen, the owner of a cosmetic surgery clinic in Miami called Body Chemistry L.L.C.Jaen, who had a lengthy meeting with baseball investigators this week, said he first met Bosch on the Miami social circuit in 2011 and gave him a small ownership stake to work as a nutritionist in his clinic. Bosch’s allure was that he was supposedly creating his own line of vitamin nutrition supplements and would be able to bring in star clients, including one of the women featured on the reality television show “The Real Housewives of Miami,” Jaen said.But the woman never came, and Bosch often didn’t show up for work or meetings, Jaen said, prompting him to cut ties with Bosch quickly, about a year ago.“He is an individual that talks a big game — you need to dot your I’s and cross your T’s, because a lot of the stuff he says is not there,” said Jaen, adding that he liked Bosch personally, finding him nice to be around.Jaen said that he would not be surprised to learn that Bosch had embellished his patient notes to lure an investor to his clinic.“There are too many people and too many big names for it to be accurate,” Jaen said, adding, “They might bring back Jimmy Hoffa and find out he was injected, too.”Jaen’s words echo those of another recent Bosch business partner, Xavier Romero, who last week described Bosch as absent and unreliable in their dealings. As a result, Romero said, he cut Bosch out of a partnership in a new anti-aging clinic they were starting.Romero, too, questioned if Bosch was capable of providing performance enhancers to the likes of players like Rodriguez, as the documents assert. “I don’t know if he really does have that kind of pull,” Romero said.Baseball officials want to speak with Romero, as they did with Jaen. In addition to taking into account the doubts those two men have, the baseball officials also have to consider the denials that have already been issued by Bosch and by a number of players, including Rodriguez.Weighed against those concerns is the fact that Braun, a star outfielder for the Milwaukee Brewers, and Francisco Cervelli, a Yankees catcher also listed in the documents, have bolstered the credibility of those records by confirming that they did indeed have a past connection to Bosch. Both, however, have denied that Bosch supplied them with any banned substances.The New York Times has not independently authenticated the Bosch records, whose existence was first reported by Miami New Times.At this point, baseball investigators appear to be proceeding on the belief that the records are real, and tantalizing, while keeping in mind the doubts and the denials.Using the information culled from accounts of what is in the documents, investigators have been knocking on doors, working the phones and trying to interview people who have been close to Bosch.Which is what they should be doing, said Daniel C. Richman, a professor at Columbia Law School and a former federal prosecutor.“Even the most sloppily kept notes can provide leads if you want to question somebody or pin somebody down,” Richman said. “Even if there isn’t absolute certainty about the records themselves, they can clarify situations or point you to people who might be able to help you.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/sports/baseball/jeter-fans-line-up-shut-up-and-wait.html,"TAMPA, Fla. — Shortly before noon Tuesday, a week before spring training was to begin, a Yankees employee named John Johnson received word on his two-way radio that Derek Jeter had wrapped up his work for the day and would be leaving the team’s minor league complex here. Johnson went straight to the sidewalk out front, where 40 people stood in line.With the glowering demeanor of a drill sergeant, Johnson delivered a series of instructions that several members of his audience could recite from memory: “Single file! No chitchat! He doesn’t want to hear about your personal life, so don’t ask him about his!”While these directives were no guarantee that Jeter would stop and sign autographs — far from one, in fact — a hush fell over the group. Was it hope, or fear? One minute passed, then two. Johnson reappeared. “If anyone from the back moves forward, we’re going to cut the session off!” he barked.In recent weeks, just outside the complex where Jeter, the Yankees’ shortstop, is rehabilitating his fractured left ankle ahead of next Tuesday’s official beckoning of pitchers and catchers, this thin slab of sidewalk along North Himes Avenue has again become the site of an annual and unusual pilgrimage that speaks to the obsessiveness found in sports.Armed with jerseys, baseballs, folding chairs and coffee, people have been gathering under the cover of darkness in the predawn hours, a motley crew of baseball fans, autograph collectors and memorabilia dealers.They are waiting — waiting for Jeter, even if he is not really ready for the regular demands that spring training brings.On Tuesday, optimism was running high for no good reason. Michael Zwick, a 47-year-old nurse from Tampa, had secured his spot at the front of the line by getting to the complex at 3 a.m. His commitment? Peerless. His decision-making skills? Questionable. It was his fourth consecutive morning out on the sidewalk, and he had yet to witness Jeter do anything other than drive in and out of the parking lot.“It’s hard to figure him out, honestly,” said Zwick, who elaborated on his own motives: “I like to collect autographs. I have a nice collection.”There is an unforgiving calculus involved in the pursuit of Jeter’s autograph. He typically arrives at the complex between 8 and 9 a.m. and stays for about three hours before leaving. The odds of his actually stopping to sign items, according to an informal poll, are 10 percent. And even then, he will sign for only a fraction of those who have been waiting.“I guess I’ll have to come back again tomorrow if he doesn’t sign today,” said Melissa Davis, a patient-support technician at a hospital in nearby Clearwater, whose prize for showing up at 4 a.m. was the sixth spot in line, a prime piece of real estate. She had not slept in two days, she said. Or was it three? She was, by her own admission, bordering on delirium.“I’m basically on a mission at this point,” said Davis, who kept herself occupied by reading “Fifty Shades of Grey” on her Kindle. “I want his autograph. You can’t really talk to him because he’s not going to sit and talk to you. So I want his autograph. That’s all I want.”A perfect storm of conditions has produced this daily phenomenon. Jeter makes his off-season home in Tampa, and fans know that he works out at the complex before spring training actually starts. So they camp out and wait. The same thing happened last season, and the season before that.“I don’t think there’s anything comparable in baseball,” said Anthony McCarron, a baseball writer for The New York Daily News. He has grown accustomed to covering the lead-in to spring training for the Yankees, which, in addition to the Jeter ritual, also involves a handful of New York writers who stand outside the complex and wait for players to stop and talk because the reporters, like the fans, are not yet allowed inside.It is hardly the way to cover a team, but then nothing about this spring training preamble quite makes sense. It can best be explained by the fact that the Yankees are the Yankees, Jeter is Jeter, and New York is a two-tabloid town that pushes coverage of the Yankees right up to the edge and over it.That intensity, in one way or another, seeps all the way down to Tampa, rousing people from sleep to gather on a city sidewalk, day after day, for the remote chance of Jeter’s signing a piece of cardboard or a baseball.It is different when spring training officially starts, Jeter is in uniform and fans are allowed inside the Yankees’ complex. At that point, there are any number of moments when Jeter might interact with fans. The same applies during the regular season, when Jeter has even been seen chatting with people in box seats while he is kneeling on deck.But this period before spring training clearly has its own dynamic.Tuesday’s drama began at 8:17 a.m., when Jeter arrived in a silver Mercedes-Benz with mirrored windows that glinted like chandeliers. “He’s not driving his Ford Focus like in the commercials,” said Vince Santillo, a 27-year-old Tampa resident who works at a gas station.As Jeter pulled into the parking lot, Johnson removed an orange traffic cone from Jeter’s designated spot. Along the sidewalk, the masses craned their necks. Jeter disappeared inside the building. The wait continued.The vast majority of people in line were there specifically for Jeter, though there are consolation prizes: the occasional relief pitcher, utility player or recent draft pick who will stop and sign.Tyler Austin, one of the organization’s top prospects, always makes himself available — an easy decision, he said. He recalled attending a Chattanooga Lookouts minor league game as an 8-year-old and positioning himself for postgame autographs by moving down the right-field line, just past a gate that led to the team’s locker room. A couple of players stopped. Many more did not.“I remember it vividly,” said Austin, an outfielder who has hit .331 in the minors. “My mom looked at me and said, ‘One day you’re going to be there, and I swear if I ever see you walk by anybody and not sign a thing for them, I will come and personally slap you right across the face.’ ”One of the stalwart fans, Juan Rivero, a sidewalk staple who goes by the nickname Johnny 5, said the three-week window before the start of spring training was an optimal time to get autographs, presumably because there is less competition from the many other fans who will show up later.Rivero’s feelings toward Jeter are nuanced: tremendous player, but somewhat aloof otherwise. That has not stopped Rivero, 50, from accumulating 30 Jeter autographs over the years. Signed baseballs. Signed jerseys. Signed photos. Rivero even has Jeter’s signature on a box of Jeter-brand cologne.On Tuesday, after Jeter finally emerged from the complex and climbed into his Mercedes, he pulled up to the sidewalk and unrolled his window, a signal that he intended to sign some autographs. Operating as a kind of consigliere, Johnson directed the occupants of the line to shuffle toward Jeter’s car, one by one.Matt Monteleone, a 29-year-old student who was the eighth person in line, felt his adrenaline surge when he reached the window. Monteleone thanked Jeter for his autograph and then slowly backed away. “Your heart is really racing because there are guys who have put in so much time waiting for him out here, and he doesn’t sign a lot,” Monteleone said.The entire procession had the solemn feel of a sacred rite, as if these people were taking the sacrament from baseball’s high priest. Except in this case, the high priest’s car was idling. His time was limited. After Monteleone received his autograph, Johnson threw a curveball and asked if any children were in line. A young boy and girl scampered to the front. Jeter signed for them and then drove away, leaving a trail of exhaust in his wake. Just like that, after 10 autographs, it was over.Brad Meinhart, a fan from Orlando, had made his way to the head of the line just in time to watch Jeter vacate the grounds. He dropped his unsigned Jeter poster to his side and appeared traumatized as the line disassembled behind him. The grieving process had begun, and for good reason: Meinhart had left his home at 3 a.m. in order to get a good spot in line. As it turned out, he had not left soon enough.“I’m stopping at the first bar I see,” he said."

Yes, you can read about the U.S. team’s humbling loss in Honduras and choose premature-bordering-on-irrational panic about the Americans’ World Cup qualifying chances. Or, you can read the breathless reports of who signed with what college team and find reason for premature-bordering-on-irrational glee about the future of _____ (insert your favorite team here).On national signing day, everybody wins. Optimism rules. Ole Miss lands the consensus top recruit, Robert Nkemdiche, and everybody goes wild in Oxford as Coach Hugh Freeze comes full circle, as Bruce Feldman writes on CBSSports.com.. Never mind that most of the highly regarded flocked unsurprisingly to Alabama and Ohio State, as Stewart Mandel writes on SI.com, and enough flocked to Notre Dame for Yahoo.com’s Dan Wetzel to declare Brian Kelly the winner. Never mind that the bizarre spectacle of it all included the tale of a mom who swiped her own son’s letter of intent papers as he tried to sign with Arkansas, as Geoff Caulkins writes in The Commercial Appeal of Memphis.The nuttiness factor helps you forget that no one actually knows how good most of these kids are going to turn out and the sad fact that we’ve turned a national spectacle into what is essentially an auction of athletic indentured servants. No, this is a day for celebration, so break out the brass bands. Everyone has hope on signing day. Maybe Nick Saban won’t win every national title. Maybe this whole system will magically become fair and make sense and the N.C.A.A. will disappear into so much fairy dust. And maybe an armored truck will crash into your house and fill it with $100 bills.If you need one story that slightly redeems this whole scene, you can read about the one-handed defensive back from St. Petersburg, Fla., Shaquem Griffin, who made a one-handed interception that helped earn him a scholarship to Central Florida.But, if unbridled optimism isn’t your thing, you might prefer to linger over the U.S. soccer team’s state of affairs. Its 2-1 loss to Honduras in the first game of the Hexagonal round of World Cup qualifying was ugliness of the American team’s own making, Leander Schaerlaeckens writes on Foxsports.com. It left Coach Jurgen Klinsmann trying to explain the mess his team seems to be, and why the qualifying road ahead now looks so treacherous, as Martin Rogers writes on Yahoo.com. Klinsmann, you might remember was hired to lift the U.S. team in the other direction, Grant Wahl writes on SI.com, not preside over panicky matches in San Pedro Sula.If you’d like to combine a love for panic and college sports, we invite you to visit the story of Kansas’s latest flop, a 62-55 splat against Texas Christian, which hadn’t won a conference game until Wednesday night. Yes, as Andy Glockner writes on SI.com, the Jayhawks have some issues.Baseball’s news isn’t any more uplifting, with the Miami-area wellness clinic spitting out more names to add to the pile of potential performance-enhancing drugs miscreants, as Tom Verducci on SI.com welcomes Detroit’s Jhonny Peralta to the pile. That Milwaukee’s Ryan Braun landed on it a day earlier just gave us another reason to feel completely uncomfortable with anything that comes out of his mouth, Danny Knobler writes on CBSSports.com, and his comments also seem to punch a few holes in Alex Rodriguez’s story, as The Daily News reports.Perhaps baseball’s lesson is, whether you prefer irrational panic or irrational hope, there’s probably a P.E.D. for that.Follow Leading Off on Twitter: twitter.com/zinsernyt"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/sports/golf/condoleezza-rice-takes-diplomacy-and-swing-to-pebble-beach-national-pro-am.html,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — In the week after learning he was paired with Condoleezza Rice in the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, Jason Bohn compiled questions and contemplated how to greet someone who had served as national security adviser and secretary of state. When he finally met Rice on Thursday morning, less than a half-hour before their tee time, her first words to him, he said, were, “Roll Tide.”The greeting by Rice, a Birmingham, Ala., native, put Bohn, an Alabama graduate, instantly at ease. He spent their five-hour round at Pebble Beach Golf Links trying to do the same for Rice, who said she had played in pro-am events but never in front of so many people.“Somebody asked me how did it compare to diplomacy,” Rice said, “and I said: ‘Well, I know how to do diplomacy. I’m not so sure about the golf course.’ But it was really fun.”Rice’s appearance in the one competition on the PGA Tour where the celebrities are typically fussed over more than the pros was good practice for the Masters in April, when Rice, who last August became one of the first two women to be extended membership to Augusta National, will draw plenty of attention no matter how hard she works to blend in.“I asked her if she would attend the Masters, and I told her that I felt like that’s got to be a really exciting event this year, and she had a big smile on her face and was very excited,” said Bohn, who lives in Georgia and has played in the Masters twice.“I’m as interested in what the jacket looks like, from Augusta, where the logo’s placed,” Bohn added. “I mean, I’m really interested in that stuff. And I can tell you that’s one club that has thought of every detail, and I’m sure they included her in that conversation and wanted to know what she thought.”Rice has membership privileges at two other high-profile clubs that were known in part for being exclusionary: Cypress Point and Shoal Creek. Is her aim to make golf more democratic?“I’m just trying to play golf,” she said with a tight smile after combining with Bohn to shoot a two-under-par 70. “Just trying to play golf.”She added, “They are great places, and I’m honored to be a member of all of them.”Rice, 58, who plays to a 17 handicap, hit her best drives of the day on the first two holes. She drained a 30-foot putt for par on the second hole after a chip that drew applause from Bohn, who finished at one-under 71. It was one of three one-putts Rice recorded on the front side.“I think she got a little nervous at times,” Bohn said. “But when she played her best, it seemed like, when she was the most nervous, like right out of the chute.”After teeing her ball, Rice rarely required more than 20 seconds to hit. It was the same on the greens. Rice seldom took more than 15 seconds to putt.“She doesn’t mess around, which is beautiful,” Bohn said. “She just hits it and goes and hits it again.”Bohn said he and Rice talked about a variety of subjects: the United States Golf Association; the debate over anchored putting; everything but politics.“She was an incredible person,” he said. “A lot different than what I might have expected, to be honest, in the sense that she’s real. What you see maybe from a political side you might not see as much of the realness that you want to. On the golf course, you see the real person.”On the par-5 sixth hole, which features a blind approach to the uphill green, Rice’s second shot landed on the side of the hill. After she advanced it several yards with her third, her fourth shot flew out of the grabby grass and hit a spectator standing behind the left gallery rope.“Did I hit you?” Rice said, moving quickly to reach the woman, who had a bloody gash above the bridge of her nose. Her daughter was trying to use a pairings sheet as a bandage. “It was a bad shot. I’m really sorry.”Rice knelt, handed the woman’s daughter a white towel to stanch the bleeding and held the woman’s right hand until first-aid personnel arrived. Before she headed to the green, she asked the daughter to call her with an update on her mother’s condition. Rice’s assistant, who was walking outside the ropes, slipped the daughter a piece of paper after Rice left.Rice’s game was never the same. She kept lifting up on her woods and irons, and her caddie, Kathryn Imrie, the assistant women’s golf coach at Stanford, where Rice teaches, spent more time adjusting her setup.“We tried not to talk about it,” Imrie said. “Obviously, she was really concerned. And for it not to bother her probably would be tough. But I believe the woman is fine, which is great.”On the 10th hole, Bohn caught up to Rice after she hit her drive, and they walked down the fairway together. “She was like, ‘I could tell I was a little hard on myself,’ ” he said. “And I was like, ‘Hey, we all are.’ ”Rice’s tee shot on the par-3 17th landed short of the green, near the right grandstand, where a fan with a cellphone camera persisted in taking pictures despite a marshal’s repeated commands to stop. “It’s O.K.,” Rice quietly told him.At the 18th tee, Bohn and Rice posed for an official photograph with Joe Ogilvie and his amateur partner, Randall Stephenson. “This is the first photo,” Bohn said, “we’re actually going to put on our mantel.”"

In the bitter cold and swirling snow at a recent Arsenal game, Wenger encased himself in what has unfortunately become his signature garment: a fluffy, puffy, oddly elongated, sausagelike parka that surely keeps him warm, but that also makes him look like a caterpillar in a sleeping bag.These are the men of England’s Premier League, coaches stalking the sideline in the most scrutinized sport in the world, in a country where abysmal weather can lead to strange adventures in improvised fashion.

Fans have compared it to an Emperor penguin outfit, something the Michelin Man might wear, a quilt, a German avant-garde theater garment and a padded mobile coffin.“It has become a symbol of the team’s lack of style, and of Wenger’s decline into a figure of open mockery,” said Roger Bennett, the co-host of the “Men in Blazers” soccer podcast on Grantland.It would take years of study to fully appreciate and decode the subtle distinctions in Premier League coaches’ fashions, but most coaches tend to gravitate toward one of three looks: Italian Playboy, 1970s East German Apparatchik and Slob in Track Suit.The most elegant are generally the Continental coaches, who enhance their well-cut suits and properly fastened ties with scarves, foulards, pocket squares, designer loafers and slim-cut overcoats. José Mourinho, formerly of Chelsea but currently at Real Madrid, is credited with bringing this European suavity to what had been a wasteland of style.A majority of the coaches fall into the second category, led by old-timers like Ferguson of Manchester United and Harry Redknapp of Queens Park Rangers. They wear team-issued suits in the manner of boys whose mothers said they had to. Stabs at stylishness are undercut by unfashionable ties and questionable accessories like sneakers, bulky sweaters and boxy logo-larded team parkas.Many of the coaches pair dark suits with white shirts, as if they all shopped at the same place, a discount store for undertakers.“So many managers wear funeral-type suits,” said Lee Thompson, 38, a West Ham fan. “I don’t know which of their team members they expect to die.”At the bottom of the heap are those whose no-nonsense track suits and warm-up clothes evoke the crabby phys ed teacher who taught soccer at your high school in the 1980s. These men seem to wish they were playing, not standing on the sideline. They are “the ones that style forgot,” said Jessica Punter, the style and grooming editor of British GQ.Yes, Tony Pulis, we are talking about you.Pulis, of Stoke City, is overwhelmingly considered the league’s poorest dresser, on account of his baseball cap — baseball being a superfluous overseas affectation here — and his track suit, with “TP” helpfully printed on the jacket, in case he loses it or forgets who he is. It is the Premier League equivalent to Bill Belichick’s woeful hoodie.“He looks like he’s just grabbed whatever the physio chucked at him as he was going through the tunnel,” Punter said.But Pulis’s clothes work because they reflect his persona as a coach so tough that he once reportedly sprang from the shower, his towel unspooling right off his waist, and tried to head-butt one of his players after the player bad-mouthed him in the locker room.Many coaches are vying for second in the worst-dressed category, but perhaps the strongest contender is Martin Jol, a big, solid man who coaches Fulham, sometimes in a shockingly bright blue track suit.“He looks like he should be coaching the Russian shot-put team,” Punter said.An Arsenal fan, Steve Murray, said, “He looks like he should be throwing you out of a bad pub in a bad area.”Who dresses best? The leading contender is Roberto Mancini of Manchester City, who through a mysterious Italian facility for folding and draping has successfully repurposed the team’s light blue and white scarf into a high-end fashion item that also keeps his neck warm. (According to a person at Manchester City who would speak only if his name was nowhere near this information, Mancini’s scarf is not the common acrylic kind anyone can order online, but a softer, squarer, chicer, tassel-free cashmere version he has specially made back home.)Despite his lapse with the lap blanket during the snowstorm, Villas-Boas of Tottenham Hotspur is the favorite of many female fans for his smoldering looks, his slim dark suit and, in the cold, his slim dark coat. British GQ recently ranked Villas-Boas, who is from Portugal, as No. 2 among “best-dressed international men,” behind the designer Tom Ford. Not everyone is convinced, though.“If you look really carefully, he’ll undo the top button and underneath he’s wearing a thermal vest,” said Matthew Hatfield, an Arsenal fan, in a tone that made it clear what he thinks of men who find it necessary to wear thermal underwear.A spokesman for Tottenham Hotspur confirmed that yes, Villas-Boas does sometimes wear a “base layer,” as he put it.At least Villas-Boas hides his protective garments. Ferguson, who has coached Manchester United since 1986, almost always wears the same winter outfit: a suit obscured by a bulky sweater under the jacket and a bulky team parka over it. There is also a tie in there somewhere and an inevitable wad of chewing gum in his mouth.Though many coaches seem to throw on whatever was lying around on the floor that morning, it would be a mistake to lose sight of the deeper meanings therein. Take Wenger’s caterpillar coat. The fans’ intolerance for its weirdness is directly related to Arsenal’s persistent struggles.Somehow, said Bennett of “Men in Blazers,” the coat looks longer now than it did last year.“We joke on the show that it’s like a giant tree — it adds an extra ring every year he doesn’t win a trophy,” he said.Referring to a much-YouTubed incident in which Wegner impotently fiddled with a broken zipper as Arsenal crashed and burned during a game, Bennett added, “There’s nothing that symbolizes the decline of a team like watching a man who was once deemed great unable to get out of his own jacket.”Appearance also matches reality for Sam Allardyce, the pugnacious coach of West Ham United, whose friends call him Big Sam (his enemies call him Fat Sam). He wears suits, but the way a nightclub bouncer does after an altercation.“He’s a big northern Englishman who looks like a man who would list his hobby as barfighting,” Bennett said.Allardyce gets respect, though, for stoically braving the vicissitudes of the English climate, once standing uncomplaining in a deluge, rain dripping from his hair and cascading off his suit.He is smart: Like piranhas or the schoolboys in “Lord of the Flies,” English fans are quick to seize on signs of weather-induced weakness. An article in The Daily Mail awarded coaches “hardman ratings” for how well they dealt with a recent bout of snow.“Managers are supposed to get out there and suffer the elements,” said Deano Standing, a spokesman for Millwall Football Club, whose coach, Kenny Jackett, is of the old, no-nonsense school, favoring utilitarian suits with parkas on top.That means no umbrellas — not now, not ever. As a reminder of this inviolate rule, consider Steve McClaren, then the England coach, who disastrously employed a huge red-and-blue golf umbrella to shelter himself from a storm at an England-Croatia match in 2007, earning himself the enduring nickname “the wally with the brolly.”England lost the match; McClaren lost his job. He now coaches in the Netherlands.“That umbrella,” Standing said, “was really the last straw.”"

January got the silliness started and now February is staging its own string of wild endings and unpredictable matchups and all the glorious byproducts of parity run amok. How do you explain five No. 1 teams falling in five consecutive weeks? How does the latest temporary No. 1, Indiana — coached by a Harbaugh brother-in-law! — forget how to play defense on the final play, making Illinois’s buzzer-beater an open layup? Why are all those big-name coaches walking around with glassy stares and throbbing headaches?This is not friendly empire-building in the mold of college football, where the move is toward simply declaring the Southeastern Conference champion the national champion and saving everyone a lot of time and travel expenses. In basketball, almost anyone can win on any given night in March, February or January. The list of powerhouse programs stumbling through their season is long, and headlined by North Carolina, as Jeff Goodman points out on CBSSports.com. Indiana’s loss came so quickly after it ascended to No. 1, as Bob Kravitz writes in The Indianapolis Star, Tom Crean is now being treated for occupational vertigo. As Andy Glockner writes on SI.com, does anyone want to be No. 1?(The latest piece of chaos came on the heels of college football’s signing day, which was such an exhibition of the rich getting richer that Ohio State Coach Urban Meyer was chastising his fellow Big Ten coaches for falling so far behind the SEC in recruiting.)The other sport that seems to be making some moves toward parity is — stunningly — baseball. In the midst of another free agent signing season in which the Yankees aren’t the mad overspending shoppers of old, Seattle, of all teams, won the race for the whopper contract of the season by signing pitcher Felix Hernandez for an amount roughly equal to the gross national product of Venezuela. Yes, he deserves to be the highest paid pitcher in baseball, writes Joe Lemire on SI.com, and Mariners fans might have staged a mutiny if the team let Hernandez walk, as Larry Stone writes in The Seattle Times. But it could also be part of a trend of smaller-market teams trying to keep their stars from migrating to the Yankees and Red Sox and Dodgers and Angels, Danny Knobler writes on CBSSports.com. That sound you hear is George Steinbrenner throwing a temper tantrum from the great beyond.Hockey is used to a certain amount of standings chaos (if you can remember that far back, a No. 8 seed — Los Angeles — did win the last Stanley Cup), but Washington’s charge from elite team to doormat has stunned even seasoned N.H.L. chaos observers, as Scott Burnside writes on ESPN.com. It might seem the Islanders are making a charge in the other direction by trading for a Stanley Cup winning goalie in Tim Thomas, but it really isn’t much more than a salary cap move considering Thomas’s indefinite sabbatical, writes Katie Strang on ESPN.com. The one thing we do know about hockey is, you have to be tough even if you’re just a sideline reporter. MSG’s John Giannone was up to the task Thursday night, taking a puck to the face and barely missing a beat.Football keeps talking tough about ratcheting back on its violence level, but then went ahead and reinstated the bounty scandal’s chief scapegoat, Gregg Williams, from his indefinite suspension, and he promptly joined the staff of the Titans. It wasn’t all that surprising considering how much the N.F.L. is trying to usher the scandal into the ancient history books, and, as Don Banks writes on SI.com, the move certainly made sense for Williams and the Titans. But the speed of his reinstatement also signals that the league wasn’t all that outraged by Williams’s violent approach to the game, as Jen Floyd Engel writes on Foxsports.com, so holding him up as the lone scapegoat did not make much sense, either.But if you’re looking for sense, don’t go trying to find it in college basketball.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/sports/hockey/power-plays-rising-in-nhl-as-referees-show-less-tolerance.html,"Devils defenseman Andy Greene has never been a hockey scofflaw. So after his team lost an early-season game against the Montreal Canadiens, he complained about the hooking penalty he received in the last minute of overtime that set up the winning power-play goal.“Obviously I don’t agree with it,” Greene said of the call. “He kind of hooked my arm. It was pretty clear on the replay.”But Coach Peter DeBoer acknowledged that Greene was technically guilty, and his teammate Patrik Elias said that players were “going to have to get used to” officials’ strict standards for discretionary penalties like boarding, holding and interference early in the season.After the 2004-5 lockout, the N.H.L. put in rule changes that allowed skill players to flourish. After this season’s lockout, the league is once again in the position of trying to win back disillusioned fans.The N.H.L. said there had been no specific push to tighten enforcement of the rules, but three weeks into a compressed 48-game season, teams are averaging a combined 8.4 power-play opportunities per game, compared with 6.6 last year. Fighting is also up sharply, from 0.44 fights per game last season to 0.63 this season, the highest level since the 2003-4 season.Leaguewide, teams have been given five-on-three power plays in 31.9 percent of games, compared with 16.1 percent last season. The Toronto Maple Leafs, for example, had eight five-on-three power play opportunities in their first eight games, compared with 12 in 82 games last season.Historically, officials have been less likely to make discretionary penalty calls late in close games. But so far this season, officials are not hesitating to blow the whistle at any point in the game. Through Thursday’s games, referees called 52 penalties in the last five minutes of regulation or in overtime of games when the score was tied or within one goal. Home teams benefited from 60 percent of those calls, and they have been granted 8 percent more power-play chances leaguewide this season.Players, referees and team executives say the spike in power plays is party attributable to lockout-induced rust, and there has been increased concern in the league about concussions, raising the scrutiny on infractions like boarding and elbowing.But they also acknowledged that the league had gradually moved away from situational refereeing to a more consistent application of the rules.Mike Milbury, a former player and coach who is an analyst for NESN and NBC Sports, said that “short of assaulting someone,” players used to expect to get away with more late in close games.Ron Hoggarth, a retired referee who worked more than 1,000 N.H.L. games in the 1970s, ’80s and ’90s, said: “We put our whistles in our pockets during overtime and in the playoffs. A player had to interrupt an unbelievable scoring opportunity for us to call a penalty, but now the standards are entirely different.”Jim Fox, a retired player who is an analyst for the Los Angeles Kings, said he preferred the consistent, strict adherence to the rules.“The N.H.L. went through the dead puck era with the New Jersey Devils winning Cups, and the sport became tackle football,” he said. “Coming out of the previous lockout, they got more strict, and now they’re trying to set the tone early again this year.”While the strict standard of enforcement may be an early-season trend, the fact that home teams are getting more power plays is nothing new. Last year, in their book “Scorecasting: The Hidden Influences Behind How Sports Are Played and Games Are Won,” Tobias Moskowitz and Jon Wertheim made a statistical argument that sports teams enjoy a home advantage mostly because of referee bias rather than fan support or travel fatigue for visiting teams.The authors asserted that 80 percent of the home-ice advantage in the N.H.L. could be attributed to the fact that home teams have historically received about 20 percent more power plays, with an even greater advantage in discretionary penalties like holding, hooking and interference. (Last season, home teams enjoyed an 8 percent advantage, the same as this season so far.) Last year, 24 of 30 teams received more power-play opportunities at home than on the road.“I don’t think there is a formal conspiracy afoot, but it’s in everyone’s best interest for the home teams to win,” Wertheim said in a telephone interview. “It’s good for business, especially when you have a league where you want to goose up good vibes after the lockout.”Part of the reason home teams get more power plays is that they get the last shift change during stoppages and can control the flow of play more often, forcing visiting teams into a more defensive posture.But three retired referees, in interviews, denied that they favored home teams during their careers. Ron Wicks, who refereed more than 1,400 N.H.L. games before retiring in 1986, said that he frequently made important calls against home teams, even in the playoffs, and once needed a police escort to get to the airport in Philadelphia to escape angry fans.But Hoggarth acknowledged that vocal crowds could call attention to infractions being committed against the home team that might otherwise go unnoticed.Bruce Hood, another retired referee, said that inexperienced referees could be affected by boisterous crowds.“Good referees won’t be influenced by the crowd,” Hood said. “But for a referee who isn’t as confident in his ability, it’s very easy for him to be affected by a home crowd.”Although there is no consensus on whether officials will revert to laxer standards, most observers agree that referees have a thankless job.“No matter what you do, you’re going to be dead wrong 50 percent of the time,” Hoggarth said."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/sports/baseball/researcher-concludes-pride-of-the-yankees-film-was-not-flipped.html,"Before the release of “The Pride of the Yankees,” the 1942 biographical film about Lou Gehrig, there were reports that movie magic had been needed to solve a critical problem: making Gary Cooper, a right-handed movie star who was definitely not a ballplayer, into a credible version of the left-handed Gehrig, a Hall of Fame slugger with a .340 career batting average.Lefty O’Doul, a former major leaguer, had been hired to convert Cooper into someone who could at least pretend he was a left-handed hitter and first baseman. But just days before the film opened, Shirley Povich, a Washington Post columnist, called reports that O’Doul had succeeded in his work “a heap of hokum.” Instead, he wrote, “everything you see Cooper doing left-handed in the picture, he’s actually doing right-handed.”The effect was achieved, he said, through trickery. Cooper would hit, catch and throw right-handed, but the film would be reversed to make it look as if he were a left-hander. To perpetuate the illusion, Cooper would run to third base on a hit, not first, and would station himself at third instead of first. The letters across the chest of his Yankees uniform would be sewn backward.Everything, Povich said, “worked out beautifully.”Now, more than 70 years later, one researcher believes that reports by Povich and others about the cinematic sleight of hand were largely untrue but that a small amount of flipping probably took place. The researcher said that O’Doul’s tutelage probably enabled Cooper, who was 40 when the film was made, to bat and catch left-handed with passable skill, although throwing was another matter.“O’Doul knew a lot about teaching baseball,” said the researcher, Tom Shieber, a senior curator at the National Baseball Hall of Fame. “You can’t sell Cooper short. I heard he wasn’t much of an athlete, but if you look at his swing, it had a funny loop to it, but it wasn’t bad.”Shieber began analyzing the film last month and ended up spelling out his conclusions in a lengthy article early this week on his personal blog, BaseballResearcher.blogspot.com.As he pored over the film’s frames, Shieber began to see how difficult it would have been for the director Sam Wood and the film’s technicians to execute all the changes needed on the field for the film to be successfully reversed.All the players in the shot with Cooper would have had to have the letters on their jerseys sewn backward to be read correctly when the film was flipped.If Cooper wore a glove on the opposite hand, the other infielders would have had to do so, too. And if the first-base running lane was erased, an exact replica would have had to be drawn down third base.Too many dominoes had to fall for the trickery to be worth the filmmakers’ trouble, Shieber said. “Like a complicated conspiracy theory, every aspect of the plan would have to have been carefully planned out and perfectly executed,” he wrote.With an expertise in assessing the authenticity of historic uniforms, Shieber concluded that Cooper’s Columbia University jersey in the movie “buttons together such that the left portion of the shirt placket is on top of the right,” which is common for men’s shirts. The same holds true of the way Cooper’s Yankee jersey buttoned.Shieber even compared the fly of Cooper and Gehrig’s road uniform pants: they lay the same way, left side over right. If Cooper’s fly followed the correct pattern, Shieber said, the film was not flipped.Another clue in Shieber’s research was the bat in Gehrig’s hands: the “Powerized” logo above the Louisville Slugger brand name was angled correctly. Does anyone believe, he asked, that the filmmakers ordered backward-branded bats for the film?“Why go to all that trouble?” he said.Unlike Kevin Costner, who played well in “Bull Durham,” Cooper was a novice. But “Pride of the Yankees” relied far less, relatively, on his athleticism than on the love story between Cooper and Teresa Wright, who portrayed Gehrig’s wife, Eleanor.O’Doul built Cooper’s swing by having him chop trees, but he told Cooper, “You throw a ball like an old woman tossing a hot biscuit.” Years later, Cooper wrote that after “some painful weeks, he got my arm to work in a reasonable duplicate of Gehrig’s throwing.”As for the flipping that probably did occur, Shieber said he noticed that the bandage that was seen on Cooper’s left hand while throwing looked quite similar to a bandage on his right hand as he adjusted his cap, apparent evidence that that part of the film was flipped. In another sequence, Shieber saw that Cooper’s jersey buttoned the wrong way — right placket over left — an indication of more flipping.Shieber acknowledged that more flipping may have been left on the cutting room floor or that the filmmakers may have taken a shot at reversing all of Cooper’s playing sequences before it “got too unruly.”Cooper’s own words, in a 1956 Saturday Evening Post article, dispute Shieber’s findings. He wrote that he knew the difficulties of playing the left-handed Gehrig but that a solution had been found.“To remedy this in close-ups,” he wrote, “the letters on my uniform were reversed as in mirror writing, and the film was processed with the back side to the front. My right hand thus appeared to be my left.”Was Cooper exaggerating?Maria Cooper Janis, Cooper’s daughter, backs her father. “My mother told me that he tried like the dickens to do it as a lefty,” she said by phone. “But he couldn’t.”Shieber’s conclusion, though, may create some renewed, and welcome, curiosity about a movie now 71 years old."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/sports/baseball/honoring-a-picasso-in-pinstripes-in-a-sketchbook.html,"There is no telling how many get-well wishes Mariano Rivera has received while recovering from knee surgery. But at least 608 of them — including ones from a Mister Softee man in New York and some hardened Red Sox fans in Boston — have not yet been delivered.Buddy Niederhoffer is the keeper of that conglomeration, one for each of Rivera’s regular-season saves for the Yankees.Niederhoffer, 36, a Yankees fan from the Bronx, became as mesmerized as major league hitters by Rivera’s cut fastball through the years. He said he was compelled to find a way to support Rivera after he tore his right anterior cruciate ligament last May while chasing a fly ball during batting practice before a Yankees game at Kansas City.“I thought something should be done for him because he has done so much for the Yankees and their fans and baseball in general,” said Niederhoffer, who is a massage therapist. “We’re talking about one of the all-time greats here. To me, Mariano is Picasso in pinstripes, hands down the best ever at what he does, and despite everything that has gone wrong in baseball, everything from collusion to steroids, Mariano remains one of the good guys.”So began Niederhoffer’s one-man crusade to collect a motley mix of signatures and kind words for Rivera on the pages of a well-traveled 8-by-10 sketchbook with a blue cover and dog-eared pages. Niederhoffer carried the book wherever he went from last June 23 to Oct. 3, the final day of the regular season. In the back pages, Niederhoffer glued photographs of some of the well-wishers while they signed the book.“I asked anyone and everyone to sign it,” Niederhoffer said.He was not exaggerating.The quest took him to barrooms and ballparks, movie theaters and spas, restaurants and concerts, clothing stores and banks, and subway cars and parks. Niederhoffer collected handwritten notes for Rivera from, among others, bartenders; hot dog vendors; the former major leaguers Tim Raines, John Franco and Mickey Rivers; the Newark Bears’ team chaplain; police officers; train conductors; Coast Guardsmen; his girlfriend, Karen Rossi; graffiti artists; bocce players; a girls’ softball team; his former sociology professor at Fordham; the Trenton Thunder mascot, Boomer; a dozen poets at the Nuyorican Poets’ Cafe; Marc Anthony’s band director, Angel Fernandez; a man in his 90s who said he had seen Babe Ruth hit a home run at Yankee Stadium in 1932; and a homeless man at Lincoln Center.One day at a coffee shop in Greenwich Village, Niederhoffer, sketchbook in hand, bumped into Brooke Shields with her two young daughters.“You are missed!!” Shields wrote to Rivera as Niederhoffer took her picture. “Get better soon! We know you will! Our prayers are with you!”On another page, a Mister Softee man, whose truck had stopped in Niederhoffer’s Riverdale neighborhood, dropped his signature between the autographs of Dwight Gooden and Darryl Strawberry.“Turns out the Mister Softee guy was from Panama, just like Mariano,” Niederhoffer said. “He was so thrilled, he even signed his son’s name.”On yet another page, the philosopher and scholar Cornel West, whom Niederhoffer also spotted at Lincoln Center, wrote: “To brother Mariano, Get Well Soon! Stay Strong! Love Cornel West.”Niederhoffer and his sketchbook also ventured into enemy territory. During a visit to Fenway Park, he said, he was careful not to incite Red Sox fans when asking if they might have a few kind words for Rivera, who has often shut down their team. “Some of those Red Sox fans looked at me like I had six heads,” Niederhoffer said. “But I took a low-key approach so none of them were overaggressive with me.”By the time he left Boston, 15 Red Sox fans had added their names to the unique get-well collection. One of them, however, would sign only her first name: “Even Red Sox fans wish you well!” a woman named Michelle wrote.Niederhoffer’s book contains good-will messages written in eight languages, including Arabic, Chinese, Danish, Hebrew, Spanish, Japanese and Tagalog.“This is as much a thank-you book as it is a get-well book,” Niederhoffer said. “This was intended as a gift to Mariano in case he was never able to throw another pitch.”Rivera, 43, is scheduled to be back with the Yankees for the start of training camp this week. Now that Rivera appears healthy again, Niederhoffer said, he would “like to get it into Mariano’s hands, somehow, some way.”A New York Times reporter who is heading to the Yankees’ camp in Tampa, Fla., has agreed to deliver the book to Rivera.“I think it would give him the kind of boost he gave us Yankees fans all these years,” Niederhoffer said. “And for that, I have hundreds of people to thank.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/sports/golf/for-john-westwood-fathers-day-in-february.html,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — One Thursday every April is designated for children to accompany their parents to their jobs. Then there is the AT&T Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, which Lee Westwood has turned into “Take Your Father to Work Week.”Westwood’s amateur partner is his father, John, a retired math teacher from whom Westwood inherited the twinkle in his eye if not the treacle in his swing. Father and son took up the game together, nearly three decades ago in Worksop, England, and although they absorbed the same lessons and learned on the same Kilton Forest course, Westwood rose to No. 1 in the world and continues to improve his game, and his father peaked 10 years ago at an 11 handicap.“I turned pro at 19 and came on tour, and he was still a 12 handicap, so I can’t understand the reasons for that,” Westwood, 39, said, laughing. “He went to every lesson that I have had, drove me there and sat there and listened to it. I just got a bit better than him. Must be down to talent or something like that.”John Westwood attributed it to his balance. His right leg is shorter than his left after he had polio as a child. His gait and his swing call to mind a push-up collapsible toy.“You can see where he got his swing from, when you look at me,” John Westwood joked. “Copies everything that I do.”At the 6,838-yard Monterey Peninsula Country Club’s Shore Course on Friday, he hit more fairways than his son, who posted an even-par 70. On Saturday, Lee Westwood shot a one-over 71 at Spyglass Hill; he is tied for 36th, but the Westwoods missed the cut in the pro-am field by 11 shots.The highlight for John Westwood, who now plays to a 16 handicap, came on their second hole, a par 4. He had a 40-foot sloping birdie putt that rolled uphill before curling downhill toward the cup. After Westwood read the line for him, his father sank the putt.“He gave me a good line, and I hit it on the line he gave me and got the reward,” John Westwood said.The vacation was Westwood’s way of paying back his father, whose influence he described as “massive.”“He’s the reason, really, I’ve got so good at the game,” Lee Westwood said. “He and my mum invested a lot of time in me when I was growing up.”Westwood has won nearly 40 titles worldwide, including two on the PGA Tour. In 2010, he reached No. 1 in the world, ending Tiger Woods’s five-year reign. He partnered with his father in a pro event for the first time in 2000, at a tournament in South Africa and they won, with Westwood also taking the individual title.Last year Westwood proposed that they team up in the Alfred Dunhill Links Championship at St. Andrews. His father said he replied that he would really like to play Pebble Beach, which was on his bucket list.That settled it. Westwood entered the tournament for the first time since 2005, the first year he joined the PGA Tour, and paid his father’s entry fee, which was upward of $20,000.“He said he’d pay, but we didn’t know how much it was until we got here,” Westwood’s mother, Tricia, said with an incredulous smile.It was Tricia Westwood, a retired podiatrist, who bought Westwood’s first clubs, in 1985, a used set that had belonged to a patient. “I paid £40 for them,” she said, “and gave them to Lee for Christmas.” That investment of perhaps $65 helped lead to a career in which her son has won about $50 million.Westwood said he was “pretty good” as a child at track and soccer. He also played rugby and cricket. Unlike those sports, golf was an activity he and his father could both take part in. They had tried to bond over fishing, his father’s favorite pastime, but that ended with a bored Westwood skipping stones in the water and scaring the fish away.They became closer hanging out for the four or five hours it took to complete 18 holes. in their first round together, Lee said, they needed 180 strokes apiece. So dry is his humor, it was hard to tell if he was kidding.“No, that’s true,” John said.Within a year, John said, he was losing to his son regularly.“He was quite small,” he said, “and so competitive, he did get upset when I beat him. One day I was having the round of my life. I know it’s difficult to believe, but I was one-under after 10 holes, and he was giving me a lot of shots, which didn’t go down well.”On the 11th green, John Westwood reached into his bag for his putter and could not find it. After putting with one of his woods, he asked his son if he had seen his lost club.“He said, ‘I just thought I’d try it out,’ ” John Westwood said. It was several months, he added, before he got his putter back.Around the same time, Westwood became one of his father’s pupils. For four years, John Westwood was his son’s math teacher. He recalled the other students jokingly pleading with Westwood to tell his father not to assign homework on the nights he had golf matches. “He only got his A-levels in one subject before he turned pro,” John Westwood said of a British college entrance exam. “Math.”The Westwoods played their first round at Pebble Beach in front of roving cameras and a big crowd that made Westwood’s father nervous. “He did feel a little bit of pressure when the cameras were right behind him,” Tricia Westwood said Friday. “He’s come out this morning and he’s more optimistic.”Friday’s round took nearly six hours, which allowed more time for father and son to catch up. Intent on making more of a mark in America, Westwood relocated in December to Florida with his wife, Laurae, and their children, Samuel and Poppy.In England, they lived two miles from his parents. Now an ocean separates them. Last week was the first time Westwood had seen his parents since the move. This month they celebrate their 43rd wedding anniversary, “so it’s a bit of a present,” Lee Westwood said. It is the least he could do, he said, to repay the unconditional love and support he receives from his parents. “It’s been a long journey to this point,” he said, “but it’s nice to get here and be able to share it.”Westwood added, “To actually play in a competition in the AT&T with your dad and tick that one off is something really special.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/sports/baseball/mike-piazzas-memoir-spins-tales-and-denies-steroids.html,"As balloting for the Baseball Hall of Fame geared up earlier this winter, rumors began to circulate about why the release of Mike Piazza’s book was being pushed back to February, a month after the voting would be concluded and the final results tabulated.Would his memoir contain revelations that he had used performance-enhancing drugs? Was he waiting until the voting was over, and he was possibly elected, before making such an admission?In the end, there were no such bombshells in Piazza’s book, “Long Shot” (Simon & Schuster), which was written by Lonnie Wheeler and was scheduled to be released this week. But there are a good number of intriguing disclosures as he recounts his improbable rise to stardom, pushed every step of the way by the support and insistence of his father, Vince.Piazza writes that he was a brat at times during his baseball career, selfish, moody and immature. He says that he was occasionally a poor teammate, aloof and entirely too consumed by what was going on in his world. He says that when he received his biggest payday — a seven-year, $91 million deal with the Mets — he was frightened to the point of paralysis.The book is Piazza’s way of walking back in baseball’s front door, at least for the moment, after five years way from the spotlight. He now leads a relatively quiet life in Miami with his wife, Alicia, and their two young daughters, Nicoletta and Paulina, with a third child due this summer. But things will become noisier this week, with Piazza back in New York to publicize the book and, no doubt, to answer questions about it.In the book, Piazza describes how he rose from the 1,390th pick of the 1988 amateur draft to become one of the greatest hitting catchers in the history of baseball. Along the way, he encountered a number of difficulties, all of which he recounts in the book. There were his frustrations over his relationship with his first team, the Los Angeles Dodgers; his rivalry with the Martinez brothers, Pedro and Ramon; his paranoia that Latin players were against him.He writes of his mixed feelings about the former Mets manager Bobby Valentine, with whom he went to the World Series; his bitter war with Roger Clemens, who beaned him while he was with the Mets; the rumors that he was gay; and, most significant, the suspicions that he used performance enhancers, which he denies.“It shouldn’t be assumed that every big hitter of the generation used steroids,” Piazza says in the book. “I didn’t.”But there is little in the book that would have given pause to any Hall of Fame voters had it been released before the ballots had been handed out. Still, Piazza said he delayed the release of the book because he did not want to be seen as campaigning for votes.“I said we need to be respectful of the process and let it run its course,” Piazza said last week in a telephone interview, “and afterward, it was appropriate.”As it was, Piazza did not gain entry into the Hall. He earned 57.8 percent of the votes (329 over all), still a distance from the 75 percent needed for induction. He appeared to have been caught up in a swell of antidrug sentiment from voters who emphatically rejected the candidacies of Barry Bonds (36.2 percent) and Clemens (37.6), even though Piazza has never been linked to a positive drug test or to any investigation into the use of performance enhancers.Piazza says in the book that election to the Hall of Fame would validate his career. As a lifetime .308 hitter who holds the record for most home runs by a catcher, 396, and who hit 427 over all, his numbers seem to warrant entry. But if Yogi Berra and Joe DiMaggio did not make it on their first ballots, Piazza says he is in no position to complain.“I won’t deny there is some disappointment, but I understand it’s a process,” he said in the interview, which marked his first public comments since the Hall of Fame vote was announced Jan. 9. “All things considered, I got over 50 percent, and a lot of people were very supportive. I mean, there’s what, almost 600 voters? That’s a lot. I’m on my homeowners board. I know how hard it is to get six people on the same page, let alone 600.”Piazza’s last game came Sept. 30, 2007, with the Oakland Athletics. He played in 83 games that season and hit .275. He turned 39 that season, and he was done. “I was just tired,” he said in the interview.Since then, he has not been involved with Major League Baseball, although he has been active with the Italian baseball team, which he will help coach in the coming World Baseball Classic. He has also traveled extensively to Italy and other parts of Europe to help develop the game.During one of his trips to Rome, he said he became interested in the emperor Constantine I and his role in spreading Christianity throughout the Roman Empire. After doing research, he commissioned David Franzoni, who wrote the screenplay for “Gladiator,” to write one about the emperor. He and Franzoni hope it will lead to a movie and have already had some preproduction meetings.For Piazza, a typical day in Miami now begins at a local coffee shop, where he discusses politics with friends. Often enough, it then continues with a round of golf before he picks up his daughters at school. Occasionally, he does some motivational speaking. Over all, life is good.This winter, Piazza took his family to New York, where he, his wife and their daughters saw the Christmas tree at Rockefeller Center, watched the Rockettes at Radio City Music Hall and went to Central Park. It was there, while Piazza was pushing Nicoletta on the swings, that she said to him, “Daddy, I want to live here.”“It’s funny how New York is in their blood a little bit,” Piazza said.“Osmosis,” he added.Still, 14 years earlier, New York seemed about the last place in the world Piazza wanted to be. He had just endured a tough debut season with the Mets, playing 109 games and hitting .348, but nevertheless booed by fans who thought he did not hit in the clutch.And yet, he committed to staying, signing the $91 million deal and then immediately wondering what he had done.He writes that he holed up in his apartment the night that he signed, stricken by anxiety. “I didn’t sleep a wink,” he said on the phone last week. “I was terrified. I’m like, ‘What did I just do?’ And people would think I would be out partying, I got all this money. It was the exact opposite. I was sweating the whole night, I was sick. I think a lot of people will be surprised at that.”Piazza also writes of walking away from the Class A Vero Beach Dodgers because of a toxic relationship with the manager, and of resolving to quit baseball and start selling cars, his father’s business. He said the experience forever hardened him, made him cynical and sharpened his businesslike approach to the game.But it is the issue of performance enhancers and his run-ins with Clemens that will generate the most interest in the book.Of drugs, he writes: “Apparently, my career was a story that nobody cared to believe. Apparently, my success was the work of steroids. Had to be. Those were the rumors.”He admits to using androstenedione as part of a supplement pack until the outcry over Mark McGwire’s use of it forced him to “phase it out.” Baseball later banned the substance.He also writes that he briefly experimented with amphetamines until they were banned in 2006. And he describes hearing about human growth hormone, doing some research and asking the Mets’ former trainer, Fred Hina, if teams would start distributing it, unaware that it was a banned substance. According to the book, Hina said he would look into it and a day or two later told Piazza it was not a good idea.As for his clashes with Clemens, Piazza reiterates in detail all the events surrounding their confrontations and concludes that there should have been a fight in the 2000 Subway Series after Clemens threw a broken bat in his direction just months after he had beaned him. But, Piazza writes, Clemens then confused the situation by simply asking the umpire for another ball, rather than being confrontational. “He screwed up the script,” Piazza writes. “He sabotaged my payback.”Now comes Piazza’s book tour, followed by what he hopes will be many more years as a mature and blissful father.“I don’t have an ax to grind, I don’t have a bone to pick with people,” he said on the phone. “I wrote this book because I had a very interesting life and a very interesting career. I wanted to be very positive and say, man, I am so blessed. I had a great run.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/sports/golf/brandt-snedeker-stays-on-roll-at-pebble-beach.html,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — Two top-three finishes and a 68.3-stroke average were not enough to earn Brandt Snedeker a player of the month nomination in January. With more of the same play here, Snedeker, the FedEx Cup points leader, has established himself as February’s front-runner.Snedeker, second last week to Phil Mickelson at the Phoenix Open, carded a four-under 68 at Pebble Beach Golf Links and is tied atop the leader board with James Hahn at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am at 12 under. He and Hahn, who shot a 66 at Spyglass Hill, are two shots in front.In 15 of 18 rounds this year, Snedeker has scored in the 60s. In 10 official events since missing the cut at the P.G.A. Championship in August, he has two rounds above par.“A lot of it has to do with confidence,” said Snedeker, who was the FedEx Cup champion last year.Snedeker played in the group behind the defending champion, Mickelson, who had a triple-bogey 8 on the final hole of his round of 73. Mickelson sent his drive toward the beach on the left.Scaling the rocks leading to the water while searching for his ball, he fell.“I got lucky,” Mickelson said. “I didn’t get hurt.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/sports/hockey/red-wings-beat-kings-in-final-seconds.html,"DETROIT (AP) — The Detroit Red Wings have put together their best streak of the lockout-shortened season, winning three straight in a stretch of four days that included the puck dropping twice in less than 24 hours.Detroit defeated the Los Angeles Kings, 3-2, on Sunday on a goal by Jonathan Ericsson with five seconds left. The Kings, the defending Stanley Cup champions, had tied the score less than a minute earlier.“I knew it was going to be ugly,” Red Wings Coach Mike Babcock said. “But, I just wanted it to be an ugly win.”The Red Wings, coming off victories against Edmonton on Saturday afternoon and at St. Louis on Thursday night, were seconds away from settling for a point after Henrik Zetterberg set up goals for Pavel Datsyuk and Damien Brunner in the first period.Los Angeles, which had made it 2-1 late in the first period on Anze Kopitar’s goal, pulled goaltender Jonathan Quick to add an extra skater. Forward Kyle Clifford got off the bench in time to keep the puck in Detroit’s end. Clifford’s shot rebounded off Jimmy Howard, and Alec Martinez scored on a putback to make the score 2-2 at 19 minutes 7 seconds of the third period.With Quick back in, the Kings failed to clear the puck, and Ericsson took advantage with a slap shot from above the right circle that trickled in.“We owe Jimmy this one,” Ericsson said.Howard made 45 saves, his highest total in more than a year.“Every single night, points are at a premium,” he said. “You have to get points to stay in the mix and stay in the playoff hunt.”The Kings have some work to do over their last 38 games to have a chance to defend their championship. They started the day among the Western Conference teams with the fewest points and have won only one of their last five games.Kopitar, though, seemed more encouraged than discouraged by the latest loss.“That was our best game of the year,” he said. “Playing like that, you’re going to win more times than not.”Los Angeles is not dealing with a favorable schedule. After raising the franchise’s first Stanley Cup banner on Jan. 19, the Kings have played just two home games. They close a five-game trip on Monday night at St. Louis, return to Los Angeles for one game, then hit the road again for games at Chicago, Edmonton and Calgary. The Kings will play 13 of 16 games from Feb. 23 through March 23 at home, a stretch in which they may have to rally for a spot in the playoffs as they did last year en route to becoming the first eighth-seeded team to win an N.H.L. title.“I think we’re a comfortable team on the road,” Kings forward Dustin Brown said. “We showed that in the playoffs last year.”Los Angeles defenseman Drew Doughty tried to give his team a lift Sunday by checking Datsyuk hard early in the first period. Datsyuk bounced back within a couple of minutes to score on a wrist shot to the top right corner of the net.“He was looking for an even-up,” Babcock said.Brunner took a pass from Zetterberg to make it 2-0 late in the first period, scoring a team-high sixth goal on a sharp shot from the right circle.Kopitar scored at the 19:19 mark of the second period.“I think it was Kopie’s best game of the year,” Kings Coach Darryl Sutter said. “He had some bounce in his game.”The Red Wings held on to the 2-1 lead because Howard made 23 saves in the scoreless second period.“Howie stole that one for us, no doubt about that,” Niklas Kronwall said.The Red Wings gave up more shots (38) through two periods than they had in an entire game this season, and that total also set a season high for the Kings. Los Angeles could not turn that into an advantage one game after being beaten, 3-0, by Nashville on Thursday despite outshooting the Predators, 32-14.“Probably our best 60 minutes in a long time,” Brown said. “Got to forget about the last 10 seconds.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/sports/golf/brandt-snedeker-wins-pebble-beach-pro-am-in-stretch-that-amazes-him.html,"PEBBLE BEACH, Calif. — Brandt Snedeker has obvious star quality, if you’re casting the lead in a community theater production of “The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.”With his flyaway blond hair, freckles and dimpled smile, Snedeker does not look as if he could scare a deer grazing in the fairway. He has emerged as the most intimidating player down a tournament’s stretch without baring his teeth, unless it’s to smile; without hitting it a country mile; and while being as careful with his language as he is with his money. Especially now, because as Snedeker noted over the weekend, “I know they are pretty close with those microphones.”Ranked eighth in the world at the start of the year, Snedeker already is halfway to his goal of reaching No. 1. With his two-stroke victory Sunday at the Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, he climbed two places, to fourth. He is the second-ranked American, behind Tiger Woods.Snedeker’s closing seven-under-par 65 at Pebble Beach Golf Links was his 16th sub-70 score in 19 rounds in 2013. In 10 official PGA Tour events since his last missed cut, at the P.G.A. Championship in August, Snedeker has scored in the 60s in 29 of 39 rounds, with only two rounds above par. He has six top-3 finishes, including two victories, in that span. In five starts this year, Snedeker, the reigning FedEx Cup champion, is 82 under par.“It seems like over the last three months, I’ve been waking up in a dream world, and it’s been pretty unbelievable,” said Snedeker, who finished at 19-under 267. “To win the golf tournaments I’ve won and be in contention as much as I have, you know, probably with not very much fanfare and people thinking I don’t hit the ball very long, I’m not the best ball striker; somehow the sum of all my parts end up being pretty good at the end of the day.”James Hahn, a 31-year-old rookie who was tied with Snedeker after 54 holes, made a birdie at the par-5 second to hold the lead for 38 seconds, until Snedeker drained a 4-foot eagle putt.Hahn posted a 70 and finished tied for third with Kevin Stadler (65) and Jimmy Walker (66) at minus-14, three strokes behind Chris Kirk (66).“Just being around him and seeing how he conducts himself, he’s an inspiration,” Hahn said of Snedeker, adding: “I learned that he is a better guy than he is a golfer. The dude is world-class. He’s a great role model and just an unbelievable golfer, and he deserved to win today.”On the eve of the final round, Snedeker said a fast start on the first six holes would be the key to his success, and he played them in four under, one stroke better than Kirk.“To go out there and start the way I did was huge,” said Snedeker, who finished the week eighth in putting, tied for 20th in driving distance at 285.6 yards (Hahn was second at 306.6), and tied for sixth in greens in regulation, two spots behind Hahn.Snedeker knew what people must have been thinking last year when he proclaimed his goal was to be the best golfer in the world.“People probably didn’t believe in me and didn’t think it’s doable,” he said. “But I think it is, and I believe in myself and what I’m capable of. When you start winning and putting stuff on top of stuff, it becomes very, very possible.”Snedeker, the fastest-talking, quickest-walking man in golf, won despite a snail’s pace of play. Fifty minutes into their round, the final pairing of Snedeker, his amateur partner, Toby Wilt, and Hahn had completed two holes.Snedeker’s coronation took five and a half hours, and when it was over he wore a double-jeweled crown, tying for victory in the team competition with Michael Letzig and his amateur partner John Erickson.“He was more interested all day in my lines than his lines,” said Wilt, an investment banker from Nashville, Snedeker’s hometown.Wilt had a 25-foot putt at No. 18 to win the team title outright, and when he narrowly missed it, Snedeker threw his head back and moaned. It was the most emotion he showed all day, as he had been trying to conserve his dwindling energy reserves.A former football player at Vanderbilt, Wilt established a golf scholarship at his alma mater. Snedeker was the first recipient, and all these years later, he looked upon Sunday as a golden opportunity to repay Wilt in kind.“You think of how many times he’s going to have to play in the last group in the Pebble Beach Pro-Am, such a unique experience and such a cool thing to be inside the ropes on a Sunday,” Snedeker said, adding: “I wanted to make sure that we both walked out of here with a trophy. Our goal was to walk out with two trophies today and for us to do that was a very special thing.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/sports/baseball/for-first-time-yankees-and-mets-will-open-season-at-home-on-same-day.html,"At its core, spring training is a seven-week dress rehearsal. The entire enterprise is aimed at opening day, and the rehearsal begins this week for the Mets and the Yankees.For Mets and Yankees fans, this opening day will be like no other. Owing to a whopper of a scheduling quirk, the teams will open their seasons at home on the same day, at the same hour, for the first time, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.At roughly 1:05 p.m. on April 1, barring poor weather, a Yankees and a Mets pitcher — probably C. C. Sabathia and Johan Santana — will unleash their respective first pitches of the season on mounds less than 10 miles apart.For the Yankees, it will be another dazzling marquee event, made even more so because the opposition that day in the Bronx will be the Boston Red Sox as the teams’ rivalry reaches its 111th year.Sure, the Red Sox have fallen on hard times. But they are still the Red Sox, with players like David Ortiz, Jacoby Ellsbury, Dustin Pedroia and Jon Lester — probably Boston’s starter that day.Over in Queens, the Mets will host the San Diego Padres in what some will liken to a junior varsity event. The idea that the Mets, usually an afterthought in New York, will have to vie for attention with the Yankees isn’t one either team relishes, especially the Mets.“Nobody is particularly happy about it,” said Katy Feeney, Major League Baseball’s senior vice president for scheduling and club relations. “But it’s unlikely to happen again anytime soon.”Normally, the Yankees and the Mets do not play at home at the same time, on opening day or otherwise. There have been the occasional series when both have played in New York at the same time, including last season.According to Feeney, the simultaneous home openers resulted from several factors. First, this is the first year with two leagues of 15 teams each and the first year there will be an interleague game nearly every day, causing some scheduling difficulties. That trend starts with the Los Angeles Angels visiting the Cincinnati Reds on April 1 for the first interleague opening day game.The Mets-Yankees situation was also caused by a change in the date of the All-Star Game, which is normally the second Tuesday in July. This season it is scheduled for July 16, the third Tuesday of the month, and when every other factor was taken into account, the only way to make it all work was to have the Mets and the Yankees play at home on the same day, Feeney said.The last time two New York teams opened their seasons at home on the same day was in 1956, when the New York Giants and the Brooklyn Dodgers did so. In those days, with three teams in the city, it was much more common. And so on April 17, 1956, the Dodgers lost to the Phillies, 8-6, at Ebbets Field and the Giants beat the Pirates, 4-3 at the Polo Grounds.Feeney was not positive, but she said she thought she was at that game at the Polo Grounds because her father, Charles Feeney, known as Chub, was the Giants’ head of baseball operations, and most opening days were a free pass to leave school and head to Coogan’s Bluff.So, what is a New Yorker to do?Michael R. Bloomberg already has a plan for his final opening day as mayor. He will attend both games, according to his spokesman, Marc LaVorgna. No word on which game Bloomberg, who grew up outside Boston, plans to attend first. Maybe it will depend on whether either team asks him to throw out the first pitch.For those who have experienced both opening days as a player, it is hard to say which would be better. Darryl Strawberry, one of the best position players to wear both uniforms, said that picking one would be too tough.“I wouldn’t be able to choose,” he said. “I think that’s a day for a fan to stay home and watch on TV and switch back and forth.”Sounds like a plan. Unless it snows."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/sports/tennis/few-former-college-tennis-players-excel-on-wta-tour.html,"CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. — Although she stands a foot and a half shorter, at 5 feet 3 inches, it seemed fair to wonder if Robin Anderson might one day become the John Isner of the women’s game.The 6-9 Isner, who reached a career-high ranking of No. 9 in 2012, remains the highest-ranked American man, at No. 16. Isner has also served as the standard-bearer of collegiate tennis on the professional circuit, having played for four years at Georgia before turning pro in 2007.But women’s college tennis has not had an equivalent representative in recent years; no one in the current WTA top 100 played college tennis.Anderson, a sophomore who plays for U.C.L.A., blasted through her opposition at the Intercollegiate Tennis Association Division I national women’s team indoor championship here this past weekend. Anderson won her first 22 games at the event, hitting powerful serves and ground strokes that might not be expected from a player her size.Her form seemed to impress Jeff Wallace, who coaches the women’s team at Georgia.“She would be one that I’d say would be right there at the front of the line,” he said when asked if any of the current women’s players at the college level could have a major effect as a pro.But while Isner and other men’s players like 29th-ranked Kevin Anderson, an Illinois alumnus, have been able to make a successful transition from the top of the college game to the top levels of the ATP Tour, women have not been able to successfully navigate similar courses in the last several years.Still, women have shown an ability to achieve bigger pro results at younger ages than their male counterparts, a disparity that can be seen in the rankings of the tours. There are 10 teenagers inside the top 100 of the WTA rankings. The highest ranked is 19-year-old Sloane Stephens, No. 17; the youngest is 92nd-ranked Donna Vekic, 16, of Croatia. Conversely, the highest-ranked teenager in Monday’s ATP rankings is the Czech 19-year-old Jiri Vesely, who is No. 250.While there is more success by younger players on the women’s side, more and more players have been able to continue dominating at advanced ages on both tours, and the average age of top players has increased. Roger Federer and Serena Williams, the defending Wimbledon champions and the second-ranked players on their tours, are each 31.The last major college success story on the women’s side is the American Lisa Raymond, who at 39 focuses solely on doubles. Raymond won two national championships in singles for Florida in 1992 and 1993 and has since won 11 Grand Slam doubles titles (six in women’s, five in mixed).Raymond reached her first Grand Slam doubles final in 1994, one year after leaving college. She also reached a career-high ranking of No. 15 in singles in 1997 and remains the most recent former women’s college player to break the top 20 in singles.There are five women who played college tennis inside the top 200. Three of the four are rising quickly and have rankings that are career highs: the 2011 Southern California graduate Maria Sanchez is No. 114, the former Stanford player Mallory Burdette is No. 126, and the Stanford junior Nicole Gibbs is No. 199. No. 132 Julia Cohen, who has a career-high ranking of 97th, played at three different colleges. Irina Falconi, who spent two years at Georgia Tech, is ranked No. 140, down from a career-high No. 73 in 2011.“I was doing really well in the juniors,” Anderson said of her decision to go to college. “But I felt that I still needed to develop, and I felt that there were still a lot of things in my game that I needed to improve on before I moved on to go pro. I decided college was the best thing for me.”Anderson’s coach at U.C.L.A., Stella Sampras Webster, agreed that Anderson’s path would have been much more difficult if she had turned pro right away.“She would have gone out there, and it would have been tough,” said Sampras Webster, the sister of Pete Sampras. “Because right now, she’s getting so many matches. She’s gotten to play and win a lot of matches, and on the tour, you can lose your mojo very quickly. And if you don’t have that support, it can be a nightmare.”Anderson, aware of the tour’s changing demographics, said: “The average age of the top pros that are making it, they’re like 25, 26. I still have time. I have the time in college now to get better and to develop. So when I feel ready, I’ll go out there and I’ll play.”Sanchez, the highest-ranked former college player on the WTA Tour, said she thought perceptions were changing about a young woman’s career path in tennis.“When I was in high school, it definitely seemed that way, that it was either college or professional,” she said. “And if you went to college, by the time you graduated, it was going to be too late to go pro. But I think players now have changed that.”Gibbs, the reigning N.C.A.A. champion, said she thought the level of play in college tennis, compared with that of the professional ranks, was underrated.“The worlds are very different, but at the end of the day, the tennis isn’t that different,” she said during the Australian Open, where she played in the qualifying draw.Wallace, the coach at Georgia, said of players like Sanchez and Gibbs: “You just need one or two to get out there and start doing really well. And I think that opens the doors for a lot of people to believe that they can, that they could be the next one. Because there’s certainly a lot of great players out here playing in college tennis.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/sports/hockey/with-goals-by-carl-hagelin-rangers-thump-lightning.html,"For the first time this season, in which they are expected to contend for the Stanley Cup, the Rangers rose above .500. They achieved that modest but essential goal on Sunday night with a 5-1 victory over the reeling Tampa Bay Lightning at Madison Square Garden, probably the Rangers’ most complete performance this season.Carl Hagelin scored twice and added an assist, making him the latest member of the Rangers’ youth movement to excel. Ryan Callahan and Rick Nash scored their third goals of the year, and the tough guy Arron Asham scored his first as a Ranger. Defenseman Dan Girardi, back from missing two games with an undisclosed injury, had two assists and a plus-4 rating as the Rangers improved their record to 6-5 and reached eighth place in the Eastern Conference.But none of it would have been possible without goaltender Henrik Lundqvist’s first-period heroics.“The most important part of the game was Hank in the first period,” Coach John Tortorella said. “We were up, 2-0, and we were giving up chance after chance. We could easily have been down, 3-2, in that first period.”The Rangers gave up a remarkable six odd-man rushes in that first period, some when the score was only 1-0. Lundqvist made saves on four of them. (He was spared the work when Vincent Lecavalier lost the puck on a breakaway and when Steven Stamkos’s shot on a two-on-one break was deflected wide by Ryan McDonagh.)Lundqvist was credited with just six saves in the first period, and though the Rangers outshot Tampa Bay by 32-20 over all, those figures hardly reflected how pivotal Lundqvist was to the Rangers’ survival.“As a goalie, you know the importance of making those saves early to settle things down,” Lundqvist said.Tortorella said the first period was “a track meet, and we can’t get into a track meet.”Hagelin opened the scoring 31 seconds into the game, deflecting Nash’s shot past goalie Mathieu Garon. Halfway through the second period, Hagelin gave the Rangers a 3-0 lead when he picked up the puck in the neutral zone, glided swiftly down the left wing and shot through Garon’s legs, chasing the goalie from the game.Hagelin has been alternately praised and excoriated by Tortorella this season. He called Hagelin one of the Rangers’ best players in a couple of games this season, but he also blasted him for his “dumbness” in taking untimely penalties.On Sunday, Tortorella was praising Hagelin again, noting that by the assessment of the Rangers’ coaches, Hagelin is creating about as many offensive chances as Nash, Marian Gaborik and Brad Richards.The two-goal night by Hagelin, a second-year player, followed a two-goal night by the rookie J. T. Miller in a 4-1 win over the Islanders on Thursday.“It’s important for every guy to chip in,” Hagelin said.All three of Hagelin’s goals this season have been against the Lightning, the first coming Feb. 2 in a 3-2 Rangers victory at Tampa.His two goals Sunday bracketed an unassisted breakaway goal by Callahan at 15 minutes 13 seconds of the first period.It was Callahan’s third goal of the season, and his first since he returned to the lineup Thursday after a three-game absence with a shoulder injury.The defeat was the Lightning’s fourth straight. Their only goal came after a botched Rangers line change devolved into a four-on-one Tampa Bay break. Even then, Lundqvist managed to stop two shots before Lecavalier one-timed the puck past him at 14:42 of the second period to make the score 3-1.Girardi played 22:10 in his return from his injury, believed to have involved a groin muscle. He was instrumental in helping limit the scoring stars Stamkos and Martin St. Louis to no points and two shots.“He’s a shutdown guy, and he also brings some offense to us as his game keeps getting better,” Tortorella said before the game. “He’s our anchor.”Girardi said, “A couple of times I felt pretty tired, but other than that I felt like myself out there.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/sports/olympics/to-survive-at-olympic-games-the-pentathlon-changed.html,"This week, unfamiliar horses prevailed over familiar wrestlers.In a decision that caused bafflement and anger among many sports fans, the International Olympic Committee on Tuesday eliminated wrestling from the Summer Games.But the move preserved a place for one of the Olympics’ more obscure sports: the modern pentathlon.By some measures, the modern pentathlon is neither modern, nor a pentathlon. Introduced to the modern Olympic Games by their founder, Pierre de Coubertin, more than a century ago, the modern pentathlon is a series of five sports — shooting; fencing; a 200-meter freestyle swim; show jumping with an unfamiliar horse; and a 3,000-meter cross-country run.In a bid to make the sport more accessible, organizers combined the running and shooting events to make for a four-event spectacle at the London 2012 Games. The competition is considered to be the test of the complete athlete, its proponents say.“My colleagues and I have been worried,” said Dr. Klaus Schormann, president of the International Union of Modern Pentathlon, the sport’s world governing body. “But we knew what we offered and what we showed has been successful.”Schormann said he told I.O.C. officials about a decade ago to give him 10 years to revamp the sport. In the weeks before the I.O.C.’s decision, he said he felt confident that his efforts helped spare the sport from elimination.Pentathlon organizers have made changes over the years to try to make the sport more exciting.In 1984, the final event, running, was changed to a staggered start, with the leader in the competition setting out first and the others following based on how many points they trailed by. In 1996, the five events were compressed to a single day, rather than four or five. The sport opened to women at the Sydney Games in 2000, and at the London Games in 2012, a combined running and laser shooting event made its debut, eliminating the use of traditional firearms.In 2016, organizers aim to host all of the disciplines over five hours in one stadium.Schormann credited the recent changes to the sport, especially the inclusion of women in 2000 and a broader swath of countries competing, with helping the I.O.C.’s decision to keep modern pentathlon.“It is a movement of women,” Schormann said. “In our sport, everything the women do is equal to the men. And more people are training around the world in different societies and religious groups. It’s open to everyone.”The United States has not won an Olympic medal in the sport since Emily deRiel’s silver at the 2000 Games in Sydney, but Schormann said that the sport’s base among young people is strong, especially in many Eastern European countries.“We are pleased,” said Rob Stull, the managing director of USA Pentathlon, and a three-time Olympian, after learning of the decision. “Though personally I am disappointed for anyone in the Olympic family who is faced with this.”Perhaps the most famous American modern pentathlete was the fifth-place finisher at the 1912 Olympic Games: George S. Patton Jr., then a 26-year-old lieutenant.Patton’s trainer is said to have given him opium, legal at the time, to prepare him for the cross-country run. He blamed his poor shooting performance on a judging error; he claimed one of his shots, which was deemed to have missed the target, was instead so accurate that it had precisely passed through one of his earlier bullet holes. The authoritative “The Complete Book of the Olympics” by David Wallechinsky and Jaime Loucky states that “there is no evidence at all to support his contention.”The military ties to the sport remained strong, and it was not until 1952 that a civilian, Lars Hall of Sweden, won. Dennis Bowsher competed for the United States at the London Games as a member of the U.S. Army World Class Athlete Program.One of the challenges of the equestrian portion is that athletes may not bring their own mount, but must ride an unfamiliar horse. In 1968, Hans Jürgen Todt of West Germany was so incensed by the poor performance of his mount that he attacked it after the ride and was restrained by his teammates.And the sport has not been without controversy. In 1976, the strong performance in fencing by Boris Onishchenko of the Soviet Union raised suspicion, and his épée was confiscated. It was found to contain a circuit breaker that enabled him to record a hit whenever he pressed a concealed button. He was sent home in disgrace.The I.O.C.’s decision secures the modern pentathlon’s place in the 2016 and 2020 Summer Games, and its advocates are optimistic about its longevity and ability to expand beyond the Olympics.That includes Grace Kittle, a 24-year-old from Dallas who is training at the Olympic Training Center in Colorado Springs. Kittle is competing in the U.S.A. Modern Pentathlon World Cup next week in Palm Springs, Calif., and is vying for a spot on the 2016 American team.“A lot of people pretend that they know what it is,” Kittle said. “But they have no idea. But when they hear about it, they think it’s the coolest thing.”She added, “It’s always great to hear that your sport will continue on.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/sports/golf/tiger-woods-steers-clear-of-riviera-country-club.html,"PACIFIC PALISADES, Calif.Hogan’s Alley is an outmoded nickname for Riviera Country Club, one golfing icon’s long-ago success here superseded by a more recent superstar’s vanishing act. The fabled grounds where Ben Hogan, in an 18-month span, notched three victories, including a United States Open, have become Tiger’s Abyss.The course, where a teenage Tiger Woods made his first PGA Tour appearance, is one he now conspicuously avoids. The former N.B.A. great Jerry West, the Northern Trust Open’s executive director, has tried to talk Woods into returning, as has Woods’s caddie, Joe LaCava. Neither has made headway.A Southern California native, Woods last played a competitive round at Riviera in 2006, completing two rounds before pulling out because of influenza. Before then, his results at the club were anemic: no victories and two top-five finishes, including a runner-up finish in 1999, in 10 competitive starts. (He is 0 for 11 in the event formerly known as the Los Angeles Open, though he lost in a playoff in 1998 when the tournament was held at Valencia Country Club.) Among the tour events Woods has entered at least four times, it remains the only one he has not won.Over the years, Woods has expressed his love for the golf course and the tournament, which he first attended as a fan with his father, Earl, while in grade school. He played on a sponsor’s exemption while in high school in 1992, finishing 125th out of the 143 players.In a news conference before the 2006 event, Woods said: “I’d be seriously upset if I went my whole career and never won this tournament. It’s one of the oldest events on our tour. it’s played every year on one of our best courses. It always attracts a strong field. These are exactly the tournaments you want to win.”You cannot win if you do not play, which has made Woods’s absence, particularly this year, so curious. In the first six weeks of 2013, Woods played six competitive rounds. He has not teed up since winning the Farmers Insurance Open at Torrey Pines in San Diego on the last Monday in January.There, Woods drove the ball well and was dialed in with his irons, which are both keys to succeeding at Riviera. And yet, when the Northern Trust gets under way Thursday, the field will include Phil Mickelson, who is playing for the fifth consecutive week, and Ernie Els, who is making his PGA Tour season debut, but not Woods.He announced Tuesday on his Web site that he would compete in the three events immediately following the tournament: the World Golf Championships match-play event outside Tucson; the Honda Classic near his home in Jupiter, Fla.; and the World Golf Championships event outside Miami.Before the tour stop at Torrey Pines, Woods was asked what it would take for him to play Riviera again. “I don’t know,” he said. “We’ll just see.”What is Woods waiting for, a freakish storm to fell all the trees that place a premium on driving accuracy? A pesticide attack on the Kikuyu grass that swallows bump-and-run shots?It is as if Woods has developed a fear of Riviera’s eucalyptus-lined fairways, postage-stamp-sized greens and catcher’s-mitt-shaped traps, and is avoiding his phobia rather than confronting it.Woods is not alone in his struggles here. His idol, Jack Nicklaus, never won the PGA Tour’s Los Angeles stop. Before Mickelson became a two-time champion at Riviera, he muddled through the 1990s, never finishing better than a tie for 15th.Mickelson’s history should be instructive to Woods. After missing the cut at Riviera for the third time in seven starts as a pro in 2001, Mickelson skipped the tournament for the next five years. Like Woods, he steadfastly expressed his love for the course but grew tired of its withholding nature, its stubborn refusal to shower him with a victory.In 2007, Mickelson decided to play in the tournament after missing the cut at a tournament two weeks earlier. Fresh off a victory at Pebble Beach, Mickelson lost in a playoff to Charles Howell III. His ensuing five starts at Riviera have included two wins and another playoff loss.What changed for Mickelson? “I don’t think the answer I have is that I figured out some way to play Riviera or whatnot,” he said.He didn’t adjust his strategy, merely his attitude.In 2007, he decided to commute to the tournament from his home in San Diego on his private jet.“It made the whole week so much more enjoyable,” Mickelson said last week. “I was able to get home and practice at home and hang out with the kids at night and have dinner with them, and it felt like kind of a home game rather than being on the road.”He added, “It was having a good week and playing well that week that kind of made me appreciate playing there more.”The first time Woods stepped foot on Riviera’s grounds, he was 9, and it was a good week, he said last month in San Diego. In 1985, while attending the tournament as a fan with his father, Woods was at the eighth hole when Tom Watson hit two bad shots. Each time, Woods, laughing, recalled, he was close enough to Watson’s ball to warrant being yelled at by his caddie, Bruce Edwards.In 1992, when Woods returned as an amateur, the tournament honored Sam Snead, who won the Los Angeles stop twice on his way to becoming the career leader in tour victories with 82.With 75 tour victories, Woods seems destined to unseat Snead. The Hollywood script has Woods, the Southern California kid, earning at least one of his record titles at Riviera. But first he has to get over his stage fright."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/sports/hockey/nhl-roundup.html,"The debate over whether N.H.L. players will participate in the 2014 Sochi Olympics will enter a critical stage with a series of meetings between league and Olympic officials in New York on Thursday and Friday.N.H.L. Commissioner Gary Bettman will be present, as will Donald Fehr, executive director of the N.H.L. Players’ Association. Representing the Olympic side will be René Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, and officials from the International Olympic Committee.At issue is whether the N.H.L. will take a break of 16 days or more to allow its players to travel to Russia for the Olympic men’s ice hockey tournament, which will begin in 51 weeks.N.H.L. players participated in the 1998, 2002, 2006 and 2010 Olympic tournaments. The Vancouver Games in 2010 produced record ratings for hockey and provided a public relations boost for the N.H.L.Fasel told CBC Sports last weekend, “Gary, I think, has no other choice — he has to come to Sochi.”But even at the Vancouver Olympics, Bettman was raising doubts about future participation.“It costs us money; it disrupts our season,” Bettman said then. “The value of the contracts of our players who are here: $2.1 billion. To be at these Olympics, we must basically hand over control of our most important asset, our players.”In exchange for going to Sochi, the league wants video, photograph and Web site rights to the competition, which are held exclusively by the International Ice Hockey Federation and I.O.C.“We have had an open and ongoing dialogue with the I.I.H.F. and I.O.C. about possible N.H.L. participation in the Sochi Olympics, going back two years now,” Bill Daly, the N.H.L. deputy commissioner, said in an e-mail Wednesday. “Now that collective bargaining is behind us, we intend to reconnect on the matters we have raised and discussed over time.”N.H.L. players, particularly those from Russia, strongly favor Olympic participation. But the union and the league are believed to be in agreement regarding the promotional value of enhanced Olympic rights for the N.H.L.The question of Olympic participation was left out of the collective bargaining agreement signed in January.The two sides are cooperating now on the Olympics and other issues. They met in Toronto on Tuesday to continue to work on realignment, another scheduling issue for the 2013-14 season.In December 2011, Bettman announced a realignment plan that replaced the league’s six divisions with four conferences, but the union rejected the proposal because it said it had not been consulted about concerns over travel and playoff eligibility.Daly said the new plan was being worked out jointly with the union and was expected to be ready soon.“We are making progress on realignment, and our objective is to present something for the Board of Governors to consider before the end of the month,” Daly said in an e-mail.Union officials say realignment is the most important matter to decide in the near future. A 2013-14 schedule with or without the Olympics cannot be completed without an agreement on realignment.Fasel told CBC Sports that the N.H.L.’s decision on the Olympics must be made by May to allow federations to prepare for Sochi.After losing three months of revenue during a lockout, N.H.L. owners may be even more reluctant to forgo two weeks of revenue in 2013-14. Then again, another good Olympic tournament could help ease any lingering discontent fans feel toward owners over the lockout.On Wednesday, the president of the Kontinental Hockey League, Alexander Medvedev, met with Bettman and Daly at the N.H.L. office in New York. But Ilya Kochevrin, a K.H.L. vice president, said the discussion was “very general” and did not involve Olympic participation.Whether or not N.H.L. players go to Sochi, the three groups in the men’s hockey competition are set.The United States is in Group A with host Russia, Slovakia and Slovenia. Canada is in Group B with Finland, Norway and Austria. Group C consists of the Czech Republic, Sweden, Switzerland and Latvia."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/sports/soccer/soccer-fixing-inquiry-focuses-on-tan-seet-eng-from-singapore.html,"ROME — Near the beginning of an Italian soccer match in Tuscany on May 23, 2010, a man from Singapore named Tan Seet Eng spoke on the phone with a Croatian associate. He told the associate he needed at least three goals to be scored in the match between Grosseto and Reggina.“No problem,” the associate said, explaining he had someone working for him at the match.With that simple exchange, Italian prosecutors say, the fix was in.The phone conversation illustrated the power of Mr. Tan, a shadowy figure living in Singapore who was called “the boss” and “the capo” by his accomplices and is suspected of fixing dozens of games as easily as he did that 2010 match in Tuscany.The game is among about 100 matches played from 2008 to 2011 in Italy’s top three soccer leagues that are under investigation — and among 680 matches worldwide considered suspicious by European law enforcement, which reported the results of a 19-month match-fixing investigation last week. European investigators believe Mr. Tan was a common link in many of the matches.Little is known about Mr. Tan, who is also called Dan Tan. Italian authorities said they were not even sure what he looks like. Their only photo of Mr. Tan is several years old.“I can’t tell you Tan’s personality or how he speaks,” said Roberto Di Martino, one of the lead prosecutors in Italy’s match-fixing investigation. “Tan is a question mark.”Mr. Di Martino added: “I have no idea where Tan takes all the money from, what he does in life. From the picture that we have, he looks like he was 15.”Mr. Tan, who is reportedly in his 40s, could not be reached for comment. A security guard at his last known address, Rivervale Crest, a condominium in a middle-class neighborhood in northeast Singapore, said he moved out several months ago.Italian authorities issued an arrest warrant for Mr. Tan in November 2011 and forwarded it to Interpol, the international police agency. So far, its search for him has been unavailing.But the findings of the Italian inquiry — 50,000 pages and transcripts of about 200,000 phone conversations — offer a sketchy portrait of Mr. Tan and how his match-fixing syndicate, as described by the police, flourished for years. A Simple BusinessThe syndicate’s methods were not particularly complex, investigators said. Mr. Tan and his associates used Milan as a gateway for their endeavors in Italy. They often stayed at hotels near Milan’s Malpensa Airport, the Grand Hotel Malpensa and the Crowne Plaza in Somma Lombardo. They even booked the same room on return visits. At the Crowne Plaza, Mr. Tan “has always paid in cash,” the report said.Among Mr. Tan’s collaborators were those referred to as the Eastern men — from Eastern Europe. Their boss was Almir Gegic, a former Serbian player. The Eastern men made direct contact with players in hotels where they stayed during training camps. That was where the bribes were made, investigators said.There was frequent communication between those who dealt with players and the Singaporeans who transported the money for bribes. The most important call was between Mr. Tan and Vinko Saka, a former coach from Croatia who would tell Mr. Tan when a bribe was arranged.“The picture is just not that of simple dishonesty of players and coaches at the local level, but rather one of an operative international network, eased by the ‘globalization’ of betting on the Internet, capable of convincing disloyal players ready to fix matches and earn easy money,” the inquiring judge, Guido Salvini, wrote in a statement.“This cartel is probably not the only international cartel that works in this criminal field, but it’s the first one that has come to light.”The main charge against Mr. Tan in Italy is criminal association targeted to international sports fraud. There are more than 150 people under investigation who face a prison sentence of up to 10 years. Mr. Tan could receive a 15-year sentence if he is found to be the leader of the ring.“He will certainly be tried in Italy,” Mr. Di Martino said. “Most of the people under investigation here will likely plea bargain, but there will most surely be a trial against all those who deny wrongdoing or have not been arrested or found yet.” Network of SingaporeansIn a region that struggles with corruption and poverty, Singapore is envied as a prosperous and neatly manicured country with very low crime rates and a reputation for efficiency and the rule of law. But European police forces say that an underground network of Singaporeans sought to fix the outcome of soccer matches on at least three continents — and reap millions of dollars in profits from bets they placed on the outcomes.“The investigations around the world out of Africa, Central America and Europe are pointing primarily to match-fixers out of Singapore,” said Chris Eaton, the former head of security at FIFA, the governing body of international soccer, who helped lead the investigation before leaving for a job at a private sports security company.“The evidence that I see is incontrovertible — the testimony of players, testimony of people involved in the syndicate and interviews of people who still work in these syndicates,” Mr. Eaton said.Investigations in Germany, Finland, Croatia and Hungary have also led to Singaporean syndicates.Mr. Di Martino said he had received little information from the Singaporean authorities about Mr. Tan.In December 2011, the Italian police wanted to go to Singapore and arrest Mr. Tan, but they struggled to gain entry.“As far as I know, there has not been much cooperation in Singapore,” Mr. Di Martino said. “The local attitude has been quite hostile. I understand that gambling is an economic activity, but I wish they could at least start investigating on these Singaporeans involved in the international syndicate.“To give you an example, they never told us whether he has a criminal record or he is a well-respected person. As far as I am aware, he could be either/or.”A Singaporean police officer declined to discuss the case over the phone, but Tan Giap Ti, a media relations officer with the Singapore Police Force, sent a statement in response to e-mailed questions.“The authorities in Singapore are assisting the Italian authorities through Interpol in their investigations into an international match-fixing syndicate that purportedly involves a Singaporean, Dan Tan Seet Eng, and have provided information requested by the National Central Bureau Rome,” the statement said.Singapore had also received requests from some European countries and was “facilitating them,” the statement said, adding: “Notwithstanding, any assistance or enforcement has to be done in accordance with the country’s laws and mutually agreed framework.”Zaihan Mohamed Yusof, a reporter for The New Paper, a daily newspaper in Singapore that has covered the match-fixing cases extensively, said he believed Mr. Tan was still in the country.“He’s comfortable here,” said Mr. Zaihan, perhaps the only journalist who has interviewed Mr. Tan. (He described Mr. Tan as a “regular Singaporean — he sounds like any guy you might run into at a bus stop or something.”) “His resources are here. His money is here.”Much of the evidence against Mr. Tan comes from his former associate Wilson Raj Perumal, a Singaporean arrested in February 2011 in Finland for match-fixing. Mr. Perumal served one year of a two-year sentence in a Finnish prison and was then extradited to Hungary, where is being questioned by investigators.Through his lawyers, Mr. Perumal sent a note to Mr. Zaihan suggesting that Mr. Tan had set up his arrest.“Seeking police assistance is a violation of code No. 1 in any criminal business,” Mr. Perumal wrote. “Dan Tan broke this code and stirred the hornet’s nest.” Arranging the GameThe Italian authorities said Mr. Tan landed in Milan on May 4 and returned to Singapore on May 17. Investigators connected his stay with the coming match at Stadio Olimpico Carlo Zecchini between Reggina and the host team Grosseto, two squads in Serie B, Italy’s second-tier league.The Grosseto players were staying at the Hotel Fattoria Principina, near Grosseto. Mr. Gegic, the former Serbian player who worked as a collaborator under Mr. Tan, according to investigators, was at the Hotel Granduca in Grosseto from May 21 to May 22. Alija Ribic of Croatia, another of the so-called Eastern men, was also at the Hotel Granduca, from May 21 to 23.In the days leading up to the game, Mr. Saka and Mr. Gegic discussed by phone the various ways they wanted the game to unfold, investigators said. Mr. Saka and Mr. Gegic wanted Grosseto to lose the match. They wanted at least a two-goal difference in the final score. They wanted at least three total goals scored. And they wanted Grosseto to avoid allowing any goals in the first 15 minutes of the match.If the players being bribed made those four things happen, they would be paid 100,000 euros. The syndicate would make much more by wagering on these aspects of the match.On the day of the match, May 23, Mr. Gegic exchanged 25 text messages with the Grosseto player Filippo Carobbio. Mr. Ribic and Mr. Gegic called each other eight times that day, including once when Mr. Ribic said there was nothing to worry about.Soon after, Mr. Saka called Mr. Tan and told him that everything was going according to plan.But in the closing moments of the match, with Reggina leading, 2-1, the referee awarded a penalty kick to Grosseto. Grosseto scored, making the final score 2-2. Only two of the syndicate’s four demands had been met.Mr. Ribic told Mr. Gegic on the phone that they had lost half of their money in their wagers — but the corrupt players had lost it all. They would not receive their 100,000 euros."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/sports/baseball/rivera-shines-on-his-first-day-but-cervelli-is-shadowed-by-suspicion.html,"TAMPA, Fla. — The juxtaposition of emotions was striking.Early Wednesday morning, Yankees catcher Francisco Cervelli stood against a wall outside the clubhouse at Steinbrenner Field and grimly answered rapid-fire questions about his involvement with an embattled clinic near Miami.Two hours later, with the toothy smile of a child handed the keys to an ice cream truck, the 43-year-old closer Mariano Rivera bounded through his first team drills since he tore a right knee ligament in May.Take one guess who had the better day.“It was wonderful to be back there again, especially another spring training,” said Rivera, who wore a small knee brace under his uniform pants. “I was grateful and give to the Lord that he gave me an opportunity to be here. I enjoyed it.”Rivera threw 25 pitches from a mound, jogged without a limp and even put himself through an extra session of fielding practice while the rest of his workout group — C. C. Sabathia, Andy Pettitte, Hiroki Kuroda and Phil Hughes — headed inside.“The command was there,” Manager Joe Girardi said. “He took it nice and slow. He didn’t try to overthrow. He’s been doing it for so long, I think he’s pretty aware of what he has to do.”Rivera’s presence revived last year’s speculation about retirement, and he said he would announce a decision about next season before opening day. “I will let you know when it happens,” he said.Why shouldn’t Rivera enjoy himself? His job is guaranteed as long as he is healthy. Cervelli, meanwhile, is competing with Chris Stewart and perhaps the prospect Austin Romine to be the starting catcher after Russell Martin went to the Pittsburgh Pirates as a free agent.Cervelli had enough to focus on with the competition, so he chose Wednesday to field the expected questions about Biogenesis, an anti-aging clinic. Biogenesis and its director, Anthony Bosch, are under investigation by Major League Baseball for accusations the clinic supplied players with performance-enhancing drugs.Cervelli’s name turned up on a clinic document obtained by Miami New Times. Augmenting a statement released last week, Cervelli said he consulted with Bosch after breaking his left foot when he fouled a ball off it in March 2011. Cervelli missed more than a month before being activated April 29. During that time, Cervelli said, someone whom he declined to name suggested he go to the clinic.“I checked with doctors, people, and somebody recommend me Biogenesis,” Cervelli said. “I went there for maybe suggestions, and that’s it. I walked away with nothing in my hands. I just went there, talk, and that’s it.”Cervelli’s account differed slightly from his statement, which said he bought legal supplements from Biogenesis.Cervelli, who is from Venezuela, said Wednesday that the doctors he checked with were Venezuelan and that no players or agents recommended Biogenesis. Cervelli said he consulted with Bosch because he was desperate to return, but he denied using performance enhancers. He said he would cooperate with M.L.B. investigators.“Look at me,” Cervelli said, spreading his arms. “Check the numbers. I know it doesn’t matter, but if you check the numbers and everything, I don’t use that stuff.”Cervelli has never hit more than four home runs in any of his five professional seasons. In his 184 major league games, Cervelli batted .271 with five homers.“Right now, I realize it was a mistake to go there,” he said of the clinic. “But it already happened, so what can I do?”An hour later, the Yankees took the field under overcast skies. More than 100 members of the news media watched Rivera play long toss with the bullpen coach, Mike Harkey. Rivera demonstrated that a cutter thrown from 100 feet off outfield grass broke the same as one from the top of a pitching mound. But he was not perfect. He overthrew Harkey twice from about 120 feet.Last year, the Yankees constructed a five-mound bullpen on Field No. 4 in the shadow of Steinbrenner Field, with unattached pavilions covering the mounds and the plates. Rivera threw easily from an end mound to the 21-year-old J. R. Murphy, a second-round pick in 2009 who split last season between Class A Tampa and Class AA Trenton. Girardi and the Yankees’ pitching coach, Larry Rothschild, stood behind Rivera, with Harkey perched to Murphy’s left. But Murphy said he was not nervous.“It was pretty cool to catch a guy like that, and it was pretty easy,” he said. “You don’t have to move the web that much.”Then Rivera stuck a bottle of water in his left back pocket and headed to a far diamond, where the special instructor David Wells tapped ground balls to pitchers. Rivera mishandled two and laughed, while Wells, his former teammate, needled him.“I wasn’t thinking about it at all, my knee,” Rivera said. “I was just having fun and doing my job. I wasn’t thinking about it one bit.”Girardi was, however.“Any time a player comes off an injury, you watch him a lot closer than you would normally,” he said. “Not pitching a whole year, you want to make sure he bounces back from his bullpens O.K., using his legs like he had before, moving around fine. We’ll watch him.”Girardi said he expected Rivera to maintain his usual spring workload — seven or eight innings, all at home — although the Yankees may add bullpen sessions or a simulated game to counteract Rivera’s long layoff. And Girardi said he would not stop Rivera from shagging balls during batting practice — except, he joked, in Kansas City, where Rivera hurt the knee.“It’s his time to relax and have fun and prepare for the day,” Girardi said. “I don’t want to take it away from him.”"
