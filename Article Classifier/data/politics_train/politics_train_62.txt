The following complete transcript President Obama press conference Monday Washington Transcript courtesy Federal News Service PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA Please seat everybody Good morning I thought might make sense take questions week first term comes end It busy productive four years I expect next four years I intend carry agenda I campaigned agenda new jobs new opportunity new security middle class Now right economy growing businesses creating new jobs So poised good year make smart decisions sound investments long Washington politics get way America progress As I said campaign one component growing economy broadening opportunity middle class shrinking deficits balanced responsible way And nearly two years I fighting plan one would reduce deficits 4 trillion next decade would stabilize debt deficit sustainable way next decade That would enough stop growth debt relative size economy would make manageable crowd investments need make people education job training science medical research things help us grow Now step step made progress towards goal Over past two years I signed law 1 4 trillion spending cuts Two weeks ago I signed law 600 billion new revenue making sure wealthiest Americans begin pay fair share When add money save interest payments debt together adds total 2 5 trillion deficit reduction past two years counting 400 billion already saved winding wars Iraq Afghanistan So made progress We moving towards ultimate goal getting 4 trillion reduction And deficit reduction Congress decides 1 2 trillion automatic spending cuts pushed next month The fact though finish job deficit reduction spending cuts alone The cuts already made priorities Medicare Medicaid Social Security Defense mean spend everything education public safety less share economy true generation recipe growth So got stabilize finances medium long term also spur growth short term Now I said I I open making modest adjustments programs like Medicare protect future generations I also said need revenue tax reform closing loopholes tax code wealthiest Americans If combine balanced package savings spending health care revenues closing loopholes solve deficit issue without sacrificing investments things like education going help us grow Turns American people agree They listened entire year debate issue made clear decision approach prefer They think fair example ask senior pay health care scientist shut lifesaving research multimillionaire investor pay less tax rates secretary They think smart protect endless corporate loopholes tax breaks wealthiest Americans rather rebuild roads schools invest workers skills help manufacturers bring jobs back America So want us get books order balanced way everybody pulls weight everyone part That I want well That I proposed And get done going make sure people looking responsible way rather lens politics Now congressionally imposed deadline coming called debt ceiling something Americans even heard two years ago So I want clear The debt ceiling question authorizing spending Raising debt ceiling authorize spending It simply allows country pay spending Congress already committed These bills already racked need pay So I willing compromise find common ground reduce deficits America cannot afford another debate Congress whether pay bills already racked If congressional Republicans refuse pay America bills time Social Security checks veterans benefits delayed We might able pay troops honor contracts small business owners Food inspectors air traffic controllers specialists track loose nuclear materials get paychecks Investors around world ask United States America fact safe bet Markets could go haywire Interest rates would spike anybody borrows money every homeowner mortgage every student college loan every small business owner wants grow hire It would self inflicted wound economy It would slow growth might tip us recession ironically would probably increase deficit So even entertain idea happening United States America paying bills irresponsible It absurd As speaker said two years ago would I quoting Speaker Boehner financial disaster us worldwide economy So got pay bills And Republicans Congress two choices They act responsibly pay America bills act irresponsibly put America another economic crisis But collect ransom exchange crashing American economy The financial well American people leverage used The full faith credit United States America bargaining chip And better choose quickly time running short The last time Republicans Congress even flirted idea triple A credit rating downgraded first time history businesses created fewest jobs month nearly past three years ironically whole fiasco actually added deficit So surprising given talk American people think Washington hurting rather helping country moment They see representatives consumed partisan brinksmanship paying bills overwhelmingly want us focus growing economy creating jobs So let finish debate Let give businesses world certainty economy reputation still second none We pay bills handle business move America lot We got create jobs We got boost wages work And got reach energy independence We got reform immigration system We got give children best education possible got everything protect horrors gun violence And let say I grateful Vice Vice President Biden work issue gun violence proposals I going reviewing today I address next days I intend vigorously pursue So I going take questions I going start Julie Pace AP I want congratulate Julie new important job Q Thank much PRESIDENT OBAMA Yeah Q I wanted ask gun violence Today marks one year one month anniversary shooting Newtown seemed generate momentum reinstating assault weapons ban But fresh opposition ban NRA even Harry Reid said questions whether could pass Congress Given hard push assault weapons ban And one cannot pass Congress measures would need included broad package order curb gun violence successfully PRESIDENT OBAMA Well I said vice president number members Cabinet went thorough process last month meeting lot stakeholders including NRA listened proposals quarters And presented list sensible common sense steps taken make sure kinds violence saw Newtown happen I going meeting vice president today I expect fuller presentation later week give people specifics I think need My starting point worry politics My starting point focus makes sense works What make sure children safe reducing incidence gun violence And I think sensible way comports Second Amendment And members Congress I think going debate examine conscience know fact I believe true everybody across party lines deeply moved saddened I happened Newtown going vote based think best We going come answers set politics aside I expect Congress But I I count things I said past belief stronger background checks much better job terms keeping magazine clips high capacity hands folks assault weapons ban meaningful things I continue believe make sense Inaudible get Congress I know But uppermost mind making sure I honest American people members Congress I think work I think something make difference And repeat I said earlier step take save even one child happened Newtown take step Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA I I present details later week Chuck Todd NBC Q As know Senate Democrats Harry Reid sent letter begging essentially take consider sort executive action debt ceiling issue I know said negotiating Your administration ruled various ideas 14th Amendment morning House one House Democratic leaders Jim Clyburn asked use 14th Amendment even said sometimes takes He brought Emancipation Proclamation saying took executive action Congress act compared debt ceiling So considering Plan B And PRESIDENT OBAMA Well Chuck issue whether America pays bills We deadbeat nation And simple solution Congress authorizes us pay bills Now House Senate want give authority take tough votes want put responsibility raise debt ceiling I happily sic take Mitch McConnell Republican leader Senate proposal like last year I happy accept But want keep responsibility need go ahead get done And know magic tricks There loopholes There know easy outs This matter Congress authorizes spending They order spend They tell You need fund Defense Department level You need send Social Security checks You need make sure paying care veterans They lay spending power And I required law go ahead pay bills Separately also authorize raising debt ceiling order make sure bills paid And Congress tell spend X say going give authority go ahead pay bills And I want repeat I think sometimes American people understandably following debates Washington raising debt ceiling authorize us spend All say America pay bills And deadbeat nation And consequences us paying bills I outlined opening statement would disastrous So I understand impulse try get around simple way But one way get around There one way deal Congress authorize pay items spending already authorized And know notion Republicans House maybe Republicans Senate would suggest order us get way spending priorities would risk full faith credit United States I think founders intended That I think Americans think democracy work You know got point view Democrats Congress point view They need sit work compromise Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA Yeah Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA Yeah Q So negotiating say negotiate considering another plan B think wait mic PRESIDENT OBAMA Well look Chuck pretty straightforward way set debt ceiling aside pay bills vigorous debate going deficit reduction balanced way I keep mind know heard Republicans House Senate increase debt ceiling amount spending cuts able push And order replace automatic spending cut sequester 1 2 trillion Say takes another trillion dollars trillion two get us one year They identify 2 5 trillion cuts get debt ceiling extended next year 2 5 trillion dollars They even Congress able identify 1 2 trillion cuts happy Republicans say want cut defense They claim want gut Medicare harm vulnerable truth matter meet criteria without drastically cutting Medicare impact Medicaid affecting defense spending So math add Now would work What would work would us say already done close 2 trillion deficit reduction add interest paying less spending increased revenue adds 2 5 trillion The consensus need 4 trillion stabilize debt deficit means need 1 5 trillion The package I offered Speaker Boehner new year would achieve We actually fairly close terms arriving number So goal make sure responsible debt deficit conversation I happy conversation And closing additional loopholes tax reform Speaker Boehner acknowledged raise money sensible way additional cuts including making sure reducing health care spending main driver deficits arrive package get thing done I happy conversation What I negotiation gun head American people threat unless get way unless gut Medicare Medicaid know otherwise slash things American people believe slashed going threaten wreck entire economy That historically done That going time Q There plan mic searching ideas PRESIDENT OBAMA What I Q let ask inaudible PRESIDENT OBAMA Chuck I saying simpler solution ready credible solution Congress either give authority raise debt ceiling exercise responsibility kept raise debt ceiling paying bills Everybody everybody understands I mean complicated concept You go dinner know eat want leave without paying check And breaking law And Congress think way American people You Congress wants debate maybe go dinner next time maybe go modest restaurant fine That debate But say order control appetites I going pay people provided services people already lent money That showing discipline All meeting obligations You And credible way run government We got stop lurching crisis crisis crisis clear path ahead us simply requires discipline responsibility compromise That need go That needs work Major Garrett Q Thank Mr President As well know sir finding votes debt ceiling sometimes complicated PRESIDENT OBAMA Yeah Q You member Senate voted debt ceiling increase And previous aspects American history President Reagan 1985 President George Herbert Walker Bush 1990 President Clinton 1997 signed deficit reduction deals contingent upon context raising debt ceiling You four times done Three times related deficit reduction budget maneuvers What Chuck I I think many people curious new adamant desire part negotiate seems conflict entire history modern era American presidents debt ceiling history debt ceiling And suggest going go default situation Because one talking resolve PRESIDENT OBAMA Well Major I I think look history getting votes debt ceiling always difficult budgets town always difficult I went last year different never saw situation saw last year certain groups Congress took absolutist position came within days defaulting And know fact matter never seen debt ceiling used fashion notion know might default unless get hundred percent want That happened Now I indicated I happy conversation reduce deficits sensible way Although one thing I want point American people also concerned grow economy put people back work make sure finance workers getting properly trained schools giving kids education deserve There whole growth agenda reduce deficits important well But never seen notion presented far least Republicans deficit reduction count spending cuts raise deficit debt ceiling dollar dollar spending cuts There whole set rules established impossible meet without severe damage economy And going put position order pay spending already incurred two options either going profoundly hurt economy hurt middle class families hurt seniors hurt kids trying go college alternatively going blow economy We going Q Off mic whatever Congress says OK PRESIDENT OBAMA No whatever Congress says I mean going send something sensible And Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA one three month time frame Why would This United States America Major What manage affairs way pay bills provide certainty terms pay bills Look I think anybody would consider position unreasonable The I Q Off mic talk daily basis default mic talk PRESIDENT OBAMA Major I happy conversation reduce deficits I going monthly every three months conversation whether pay bills severe damage Even threat default hurts economy It hurting economy speak We debate If want conversation reduce deficit let We last two years We entire campaign And way American people agreed reduce deficits balanced way also takes account need us grow economy put people back work And despite conversation despite election results position taken part House Republicans got way And simply pay America bills Well know position sustainable time It one good economy It certainly going kind precedent I want establish presidency future presidents even side Democrats like voting debt ceiling Republican president yet never saw situation Democrats suggested somehow would go ahead default get hundred percent way That supposed work Jon Karl Q Thank Mr President On issue guns given difficult would say impossible get gun control measure passed Congress willing able using powers presidency act without Congress And I also like know make long lines seeing gun shows gun stores around country I mean even Connecticut applications guns since shooting Newtown PRESIDENT OBAMA Well understanding vice president going provide range steps take reduce gun violence Some require legislation I accomplish executive action And I reviewing today I said I speak detail going go ahead propose later week But I confident steps take require legislation within authority president And get step opportunity reduce possibility gun violence I want go ahead take Q Any idea time frame PRESIDENT OBAMA Well I think example gathering data example guns fall hands criminals track effectively may steps take administratively opposed legislation As far people lining purchasing guns know I think seen time oppose common sense gun control gun safety measures pretty effective way ginning fear part gun owners somehow federal government take guns away And know probably economic element It obviously good business But I think know us look problem repeatedly said responsible gun owners people gun protection hunting sportsmanship anything worry The issue whether believe Second Amendment The issue sensible steps take make sure somebody like individual Newtown walk school gun bunch children shockingly rapid fashion And surely something And know part challenge know confront even sight slightest hint sensible responsible legislation area stands notion somehow comes everybody guns going taken away It unfortunate case look first four years administration tried tighten enforce laws already books But pretty hard argue somehow gun owners rights infringed Q Off mic irrational fear driving people go mic PRESIDENT OBAMA Excuse Q Do think irrational fear mic PRESIDENT OBAMA Well I said I think fear fanned worried possibility legislation getting Julianna Goldman Q Thank Mr President I want come back debt ceiling summer 2011 said negotiate debt ceiling Last year said extend Bush tax cuts wealthy So say going negotiate debt ceiling year House Republicans take seriously think get one minute midnight scenario going back PRESIDENT OBAMA Well first Julianna let take example year fiscal cliff I say I would conversations extending Bush tax cuts What I said going extend Bush tax cuts wealthy And Now argue campaign I said I set criteria wealthy 250 000 dollars ended 400 000 dollars fact matter millionaires billionaires paying significantly taxes I said So know start concern making sure tax code fair protected middle class biggest priority making sure middle class taxes go You know difference year 2011 fact already made 1 2 trillion cuts And time I indicated cuts could sensibly make would damage economy would impede growth I said time I think pair revenue order overall balanced package But budget reflected cuts discretionary spending My budget reflected cuts needed made And made cuts Now challenge going forward made big cuts going deficit reduction way balanced responsible way The alternative us go ahead cut commitments made things like Medicare Social Security Medicaid us fundamentally change commitments made make sure seniors go poverty children disabled properly cared For us change contract made American people rather look options like closing loopholes corporations need points long term trend know fundamentally I think undermined people expect government parties sit negotiate compromise also reflect American people one narrow faction able simply dictate 100 percent want time otherwise threaten destroy American economy Another way putting got break habit negotiating crisis And good time start second term continue path really stopping principle I mean literally even divided government even got Democratic president Democratic Senate small group House Representatives could simply say know every two months every three months every six months every year going change economy ways prefer despite strong objections Americans across country otherwise going America pay bills And know way us business And way I would make argument Republican president Republican Senate handful Democrats suggesting going hijack process make sure either get way hundred percent time otherwise know going default America obligations Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA No look I said I happy conversation deficit reduction Q So technically willing negotiate PRESIDENT OBAMA Nope Julianna look pretty straightforward Either Congress pays bills Now want keep responsibility If John Boehner Mitch McConnell think come plan somehow meets criteria set raise debt ceiling free go ahead try But proposals put forward order accomplish cutting spending means cuts things like Medicare education American people profoundly reject Now think get Congress free try But I think better way go ahead say going pay bills question actually get deficit manageable sustainable way And conversation I happy All right Matt Spetalnick Q Thank sir You spoke extensively debt ceiling debate Republicans said willing allow government shutdown take place rather put deep spending cuts Are prepared allow government grind halt disagree spending cut proposals put forth And think American people would blame came pass PRESIDENT OBAMA Well ultimately Congress makes decisions whether spend money whether keep government open And Republicans Congress made decision want shut government order get way votes least House Representatives probably I think would mistake I think would profoundly damaging economy I think would actually add deficit impede growth I think shortsighted But elected representatives folks put positions going make decision And I I suspect American people would blame Washington able get act together But larger issue trying accomplish Are trying reduce deficit Because trying reduce deficit shape bipartisan plan reduce deficit I mean really objective Our concern spending take case way balancing take money increasing revenue reduce spending And recipe getting done And conversation I Speaker Boehner end year came pretty close I mean hundred billion dollars separating us stretched 10 year period lot But seems motivating propelling point House Republicans simply deficit reduction They particular vision government So suspicious government commitments example make sure seniors decent health care get older They suspicions Social Security They suspicions whether government make sure kids poverty getting enough eat whether spending money medical research So got particular view government And view rejected American people debated presidential campaign I think every poll indicates American people actually think commitment Medicare education really important something look last resort terms reducing deficit makes lot sense us close example corporate loopholes go putting bigger burden students seniors But House Republicans disagree want shut government see get way prerogative That system set It damage economy You know government big part economy And interesting lot times people recognize comes defense spending know folks say got cut spending complain know government jobs anything comes defense contractor district think wow pretty important part economy district stop spending let make sure spending folks Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA Well know look hope common sense prevails know That always preference I think would preference American people would good economy So let know repeat If issue deficit reduction getting deficits sustainable time getting debt sustainable place Democrats Republicans Congress partner We achieve know achieve fairly quickly I mean know numbers know needs done We know balanced approach would take already done probably half deficit reduction need stabilize debt deficit There probably pain drama getting needed And finishing job difficult everybody comes conversation open mind recognize things like paying bills bounds All right I going take one last question Jackie Calmes Q Thank Mr President PRESIDENT OBAMA Yep Q I like ask reached end first term starting second couple criticisms one long standing another recent The long standing one seems become truism sorts staff insular socialize enough And second recent criticism team taking shape diverse diverse could even terms getting additional voices gender race ethnic diversity So I like address PRESIDENT OBAMA Sure Let take second one first You know I proud first four years diverse diverse White House Cabinet history And I intend continue turns look best people given incredible diversity country going end diverse staff diverse diverse team diversity helps create effective policymaking better decision making brings different perspectives table So think first four years person probably influence foreign policy woman The people charge moving forward important domestic initiative health care women The person charge homeland security woman My two appointments Supreme Court women And 50 percent White House staff women So I think people expect record built upon next four years Now I made four appointments far And one woman admittedly high profile one leaving already left administration I made replacement But I would suggest everybody kind wait seen appointments White House staff Cabinet rush judgment Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA But I I guess I saying Jack I think seen overall team looks like premature assume somehow going backwards We going backwards going forward With respect truism socializing enough patting folks back stuff people know know I I pretty friendly guy And I like good party And know truth know I Senate I great relationships point I became president accusation heard frequently I think I think really gone terms paralysis Washington difficulties negotiations stark differences terms policy sharp differences terms stand issues And know think let say Speaker Boehner I like Speaker Boehner personally And know went played golf great time get deal done 2011 You know I congressional picnic folks coming taking pictures family I promise Michelle I nice wonderful time scattered laughter prevent going floor House know blasting big spending socialist You know reason know many cases Congress votes way talks way talk takes positions negotiations take imperatives feel terms politics right They worried district They worried going back home I think lot Republicans point feel given much energy devoted media preferred Republican constituencies demonize look real good socializing Charlie Crist Florida I think testifies I think lot folks say well know look like cooperative chummy president might cause us problems That might excuse us get challenge somebody primary So tends challenge I promise invite folks Congress time And I choose come I enjoy company Sometimes choose come fact I think consider optics useful politically And ultimately way going get stuff done personal relationships important obviously I always better job nice thing girls getting older want spend much time anyway Laughter So I probably calling around looking somebody play cards something OK I I getting kind lonely big house Q Off mic PRESIDENT OBAMA So maybe maybe whole bunch members House Republican caucus want come socialize But suspicion getting issues resolved talked big stuff whether get sensible laws passed prevent gun violence whether America paying bills whether get immigration reform done going determined largely respective parties stand policy maybe importantly attitude American people Now American people feel strongly issues push hard reward reward members Congress votes know reject sort uncompromising positions sharp partisanship always looking next election reward folks trying find common ground I think see behavior Congress change And true whether I life party stick mud All right
