https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/business/economy/federal-reserve-richard-clarida.html,"WASHINGTON — President Trump continued a sweeping remake of the Federal Reserve’s leadership on Monday by nominating Richard Clarida, a Treasury official in the administration of President George W. Bush, for the Fed’s second-ranking job.Mr. Clarida, a Columbia University economist, is a scholar in monetary policy whose expertise would complement the background of the Fed chairman, Jerome H. Powell, who is not an academically trained economist.In addition to the nomination of Mr. Clarida, which was widely expected, the White House announced that Mr. Trump would nominate Michelle Bowman, the Kansas bank commissioner, for a seat on the Fed board to represent community banks. Ms. Bowman is a former vice president at Farmers & Drovers Bank in Council Grove, Kan.The Fed’s seven-seat Board of Governors is currently functioning with three members, and the vacancies give Mr. Trump the opportunity to put his own stamp on monetary policy.If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Clarida would be part of the Fed’s leadership troika, along with Mr. Powell and John C. Williams, who will have a seat on the central bank’s policymaking board as the incoming president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.Mr. Powell, who succeeded Janet L. Yellen, has been a Fed governor, a partner at the Carlyle Group and a Treasury official under President George Bush. Mr. Williams, an academic economist, currently leads the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.Mr. Clarida, 60, served as assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy from 2002 to 2003. For more than a decade, he has been a global strategic adviser for the investment giant Pimco. His academic work includes research papers on exchange rates, inflation and optimal monetary policy.His nomination won quick applause from Fed watchers and some economists, who cast him as a serious thinker unlikely to radically pull the central bank away from its gradual approach to raising interest rates as the economy continues to heal from the financial crisis.“Rich Clarida is an outstanding monetary economist whose knowledge of monetary policy and international finance will add greatly to the Fed in this most interesting time,” said R. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of Columbia’s business school and a former chairman of the second President Bush’s Council of Economic Advisers. “In addition, Rich’s knowledge of and experience in financial markets will make him a valuable colleague for Chairman Powell.”Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist and the writer of the Fed Watch blog, said in an email that Mr. Clarida was “a solid pick — a respected academic economist plus market experience via Pimco plus government experience.”“I don’t think every position needs to be filled by a trained macroeconomist, but given the nature of the job, I think there needs to be a heavy dominance of trained macroeconomists,” Mr. Duy said. “I think he fits within the current consensus as well so, like the elevation of Williams, represents largely a maintenance of the status quo, at least for now.”Tony Fratto, a former colleague of Mr. Clarida’s at the Treasury Department, said the nominee’s positions were always driven by data.“He’s a traditional conservative Republican economist,” Mr. Fratto said. “You’re not going to find a lot of controversial positions from him. You’re not going to find him saying things that are particularly ideological. He’s just a strong policy guy.”The post to which Mr. Clarida was nominated had been vacant since Stanley Fischer, an appointee of President Barack Obama, stepped down in October.One thing his nomination will not do is bring diversity to the Fed’s leadership team, which is all-male and all-white — a complaint liberal groups made about the New York Fed’s selection of Mr. Williams. But the reaction to Mr. Clarida’s selection among Fed critics was reserved.“Like all nominees, Clarida should be vetted thoroughly for his commitment to the full-employment mandate and to regulating banks to avoid another financial crash,” said Shawn Sebastian, the director of the Fed Up campaign, a coalition of labor and other liberal groups that have pushed the Fed to keep interest rates low to aid job creation.Ms. Bowman, 46, would increase gender diversity on a board that includes only one other woman, Lael Brainard, along with Mr. Powell and Randal K. Quarles, the Fed’s vice chairman for supervision. Mr. Trump has also nominated Marvin Goodfriend, an economist at Carnegie Mellon University, to the board — although his confirmation is in question in the Senate.Like Mr. Clarida, Ms. Bowman is a veteran of the second Bush administration, where she worked for the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Homeland Security. Before returning to her native Kansas in 2010, she led a government and public affairs consulting company in London.Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio, the top Democrat on the Senate Banking Committee, said he looked forward to hearing more from the nominees, but suggested that he would want assurances that neither would participate in the Trump administration’s rollback of financial regulations established after the 2008 financial crisis.“I hope Mr. Clarida and Ms. Bowman don’t have the same collective amnesia that plagues many in this administration,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/17/business/economy/trade-midterm.html,"President Trump’s trade policies enjoy the strong backing of his supporters but are less popular among independents, moderate Republicans and others whose votes could decide control of Congress in the midterm election this fall. That could complicate Republicans’ plans to make their economic record a central argument in their case for re-election.Over all, Americans are about evenly split on the steel and aluminum tariffs that Mr. Trump announced early last month, according to a survey conducted in early April for The New York Times by the online polling firm SurveyMonkey. Support split mostly along predictable partisan lines, with 78 percent of Republicans supporting Mr. Trump’s tariffs and 74 percent of Democrats opposing them.Only 68 percent of self-described moderate Republicans said they supported the tariffs, however, and only 42 percent of independents did so. Support for the measure was also softer among better-educated and wealthier Americans of both political parties, echoing other evidence that backing for Mr. Trump’s agenda is weaker in the affluent suburbs that were once a Republican stronghold.Jeffrey Campbell, a 49-year-old lawyer in Minneapolis, said he liked the tax bill that Republicans passed late last year, and he gave Mr. Trump credit for moving to reduce regulation. But he opposes Mr. Trump’s tariffs, saying they will benefit a few favored industries while hurting the economy over all.“A few people benefit from the protection,” Mr. Campbell said. “But when prices rise as a result, the net effect, I think, is harmful to the economy.”Minnesota is a key political battleground this year, with several competitive House seats and two Senate elections because of the resignation of Al Franken after a sexual-misconduct scandal last year. Mr. Campbell said that he was still likely to support Republican candidates, but that he was frustrated by the party’s shift toward protectionism and support for increased government spending.“I blame Republicans for that,” Mr. Campbell said. “A very significant portion of Republicans in Congress are not really conservative when it comes to spending.”The re-emergence of trade as a central political issue has scrambled traditional partisan alignments in ways that carry risks for both parties. Mr. Trump won the presidency partly by tapping into voters’ concerns about the impact of globalization on jobs and wages, particularly in the industrial Midwest.But free trade still receives strong support among business groups, which have historically backed Republican candidates, and among big-dollar conservative political donors such as the Koch network. As recently as 2015, three-quarters of House Republicans voted for a measure meant to open trade even further — so-called “fast track” negotiating authority for President Barack Obama.Reflecting those tensions, congressional Republican leaders have criticized Mr. Trump’s tariffs as potentially harmful to businesses and consumers while also praising the president’s broader goals on trade.Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, opened a hearing on the effects of tariffs on the economy last week by saying the measures “curtail economic growth, discourage new investment, delay new hiring, and put American workers at a huge disadvantage to foreign competitors.”But he added, “I remain committed to working with President Trump and the White House on strong, enforceable trade policies that will target bad actors and encourage economic growth here at home.”Democrats face their own challenges on the issue. As Republicans have shifted away from supporting free-trade agreements, Democrats have embraced them: In the Times poll, 73 percent of Democrats said they thought free-trade agreements helped the United States, compared with 51 percent of Republicans. But union members, long a key source of mobilization and support for Democrats, retain the party’s longtime skepticism of free trade.“It’s not an ideal issue for either party,” said Robert J. Blendon, who directs the Harvard Opinion Research Program at the Harvard School of Public Health. “It makes the issue slightly more complex because their voters’ views don’t correspond to their interest groups.”For Republicans, Mr. Trump’s trade battles pose an additional risk of undermining the party’s core economic message. Republicans have tried to emphasize the tax law they passed in December, which cut taxes on businesses and most households. But trade has largely pushed the tax law from the headlines, and support for the law, which rose early in the year, now seems to be ebbing.“You’re starting to certainly complicate the message,” said Jon Cohen, chief research officer for SurveyMonkey.The trade fight has also roiled financial markets, which had risen steadily during Mr. Trump’s first year in office. If that volatility continues, it could erode consumers’ confidence in the economic recovery. There are hints that could already be happening: The University of Michigan’s measure of consumer sentiment dipped slightly in April, with many respondents citing trade as a source of concern. SurveyMonkey’s consumer confidence index also ticked down in April, with the largest declines coming among higher-earning households, which are much more likely to own stocks.“It’s possible the war of words over trade, tariffs and sanctions, and the financial market turmoil we had has led to some setback in consumer confidence,” said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank.Consumer confidence remains high over all, however, and there is little evidence that the tariffs have hurt the economy so far. Retail sales rose in March, according to data released by the Commerce Department on Monday, and the job market continues to make steady progress. Economists say an outright trade war could derail the economy, but the tariffs announced so far fall well short of that.Ethan Brackenbury, a cost estimator for the federal Department of Energy in southeastern Washington State, said that he didn’t like the idea of a trade war, and that he hadn’t noticed any gain from the tax cut in his paycheck. But the economy seems strong in his area, he said, and he views any declines in the stock market as an opportunity to buy, not a signal to sell.“I’m certainly not worried, nor am I excited,” Mr. Brackenbury said. “I don’t see long lines of unemployment or those kinds of things. Everyone seems to be gainfully employed.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/19/us/politics/trump-trade-export-import-bank.html,"WASHINGTON — As trade tensions mount, an 84-year-old Washington institution could have been a powerful tool for President Trump. The institution, the Export-Import Bank, was created to help American companies compete overseas and bolster exports by providing cheap government-backed loans.But the institution, which once financed multibillion-dollar projects, has been effectively crippled by the Trump administration. The bank has been without a chairman since Mr. Trump took office and the last of the bank’s five board members quit in March. Since 2015, it has not had the quorum of at least three members it needs to finance deals or projects worth more than $10 million.The effective shuttering of the bank has put American manufacturers like Boeing and General Electric at a global disadvantage, prompting a frenzied lobbying campaign by business groups worried that the White House is undermining its own trade goals.“The Export-Import Bank plays a vital role in supporting American companies as they work to sell their products to customers across the world,” said Neil Bradley, the executive vice president and chief policy officer of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. “But as long as the seats remain vacant, U.S. businesses are at a disadvantage relative to global competitors.”In the past, the bank had been used by large corporations like Boeing and General Electric, which received loan guarantees to sell products like airplanes, satellites and industrial equipment to developing countries, lifting sales and supporting American jobs. It has provided loan guarantees to overseas airlines looking to buy American-made jets and helped organizations like the Environmental Chemical Corporation build water facilities in Africa.Proponents of the bank, including some lawmakers, argue the institution could be a powerful weapon for a president who wants to increase domestic manufacturing and narrow the gap between what the United States imports and what it exports overseas.Ex-Im provides the kind of government subsidies that other nations regularly use to help domestic companies compete abroad. Mr. Trump regularly blames those subsidies for a flood of cheap imports, saying they exacerbate the United States trade imbalance.The bank was languishing before Mr. Trump took office, but it has worsened under his watch. Last year, Mr. Trump’s pick to  oversee Ex-Im, Scott Garrett, a critic of the bank, was rejected by the Senate over concerns that he would close the agency. The other directors who were nominated by Mr. Trump remain stalled in the Senate, and the president has yet to pick a new leader to take the helm.To business groups, manufacturers and veterans of the bank, Mr. Trump appears to be undermining his own trade aspirations by leaving Ex-Im in the lurch.“I’m not sure he’s really being well served,” said Fred P. Hochberg, the most recent chairman of the bank, who departed in 2017. “If you want to be able to reduce trade deficits and you want to be able to export more, particularly capital goods, that’s what an Export-Import Bank does.”In recent years, the bank has been barely functional. According to its most recent annual report, Ex-Im authorized just $3.4 billion of mostly short-term export credit in 2017. That is down from the $20 billion that it authorized in 2014, the last year that the bank was fully operational. The report points out that China provided $34 billion in medium- and long-term financing for its exports in 2016, underscoring the competitive disadvantage that the United States faces.The bank’s crippling has been costly for both companies and their workers, including Boeing, which Mr. Trump has hailed as an emblem of American innovation. In the last two years, two deals involving the sale of its commercial satellites have been canceled and one was significantly delayed given the lack of a quorum at Ex-Im. The stalling of these deals alone has cost the company hundreds of millions of dollars.“Restoring the Export-Import Bank to full strength is the single best thing Washington can do right now to build on the economic momentum of tax reform, shrink our trade deficits and level the playing field so American workers can win,” said Tim Keating, Boeing’s executive vice president for government operations.In 2015, General Electric said that it would stop manufacturing certain gas engines in Waukesha, Wis., and that it would instead build a $265 million plant in Canada, which was offering financial support through its version of Ex-Im, known as Export Development Canada. G.E. attributed the move to the lack of United States export financing, saying in a statement that the company “will secure access to Canadian Export Finance to fill the gap from the lapse of the U.S. Export-Import Bank.”After the bank’s board became empty last month, Jay Timmons, the chief executive of the National Association of Manufacturers, sent letters to every senator urging them to hold a vote on Mr. Trump’s nominees. Mr. Timmons warned that the lack of action was costing American jobs.“Countries in Europe and beyond have been luring U.S. manufacturers to set up shop overseas to take advantage of foreign export financing because the U.S. system is effectively broken,” Mr. Timmons said. “Manufacturers in the United States have lost billions of dollars in deals, and tens of thousands of American workers have lost opportunities for well-paying jobs supported by the exports that the Ex-Im Bank could have helped secure.”At a congressional hearing last week, Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania, pressed Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, about the fate of the bank and argued that not using its financing amounted to a lost opportunity. He suggested that some in the Trump administration wanted the bank to collapse.“The president says he wants to see the trade deficit shrink, here’s a way we can do it,” Mr. Dent said.In an interview after the hearing, Mr. Mnuchin would not say when the president would nominate a new leader for the bank, or whether some of his colleagues were rooting for its demise, but he insisted that Mr. Trump supported keeping the bank alive.“The president does want it to function,” Mr. Mnuchin said.In an interview last year with The Wall Street Journal, Mr. Trump said he had initially been opposed to Ex-Im, seeing it as unnecessary, but had changed his mind.“So instinctively you would say it’s a ridiculous thing, but actually it’s a very good thing and it actually makes money,” he said. “You know, it actually could make a lot of money.”But the White House has done little to advance its nominees and politics continue to be an obstacle. Conservatives have traditionally disliked the bank because they argue that it amounts to corporate welfare and rewards rich corporations that do not need taxpayer assistance.“They distort markets, impose risk on taxpayers and they’re bad policy for everybody,” said Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, who has been one of the most outspoken critics of Ex-Im and favors private financing alternatives.Mr. Toomey has used procedural tactics to delay the nomination of the remaining nominees to the bank’s board. He said he wanted Mr. Trump to pick a “reformer” like Mr. Garrett, who does not believe in the current mission of the bank. And he said he hoped that the president would urge other countries to unwind their export financing banks as part of his trade negotiations.Democrats who support the bank are growing increasingly impatient.“One of the best things we can do to help the economy support jobs is to get Ex-Im fully functioning as soon as possible,” said Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, and “the full Senate should immediately confirm the bipartisan nominees so we can continue to support American businesses, manufacturing and jobs.”Action does not appear to be forthcoming. An aide to Mr. McConnell said that votes on Mr. Trump’s other nominees would not be held until he names a new chairman.For now, Ex-Im is ambling along. Veterans of the bank say that career employees are increasingly heading for the exits. Atop the bank’s website is an image of its boardroom, with five empty chairs.This week, Ex-Im will hold its annual conference in Washington, but considering the circumstances, the gathering is unlikely to be a festive event.“Who are you going to get to speak?” Mr. Hochberg wondered. “I want to know what they are going to say.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/business/economy/powell-federal-reserve-economy.html,"CHICAGO — Jerome H. Powell used his inaugural speech as Federal Reserve chairman on Friday to highlight the strength of the United States economic recovery, and told a questioner that a potential trade war would have no immediate effect on the Fed’s plans to continue gradually raising interest rates this year.Mr. Powell, in a speech before the Economic Club of Chicago, said the economy continued to experience tailwinds. Referring to the Fed’s policymaking body, he added that “the labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong.”Later, in a question-and-answer session with Mellody Hobson, who heads the economic club, he said it was “too early to say” how tariffs imposed by the United States and China might affect growth and inflation.“The discussion about tariffs is at a relatively early stage, and we talked about this at the F.O.M.C. meeting a couple of weeks ago now,” Mr. Powell said. “And people really don’t see yet any implications in the near term for the outlook, because we don’t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be.”Mr. Powell also said, in the question session, that he saw little evidence that regulations were holding back the performance of American banks, or that immigration levels were weighing on wage growth in the United States.In his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed saw “other signs of economic strength” in the United States, citing “steady income gains, rising household wealth and elevated consumer confidence,” which he said would continue to support consumer spending.“Business investment improved markedly last year following two subpar years, and both business surveys and profit expectations point to further gains ahead,” he said. The recently enacted tax cuts and spending increases are helping to lift investment, Mr. Powell said, adding that “strong global growth has boosted U.S. exports.”Mr. Powell’s remarks made no mention of President Trump’s series of trade measures against China, including a directive late Thursday that the United States trade representative consider tariffs on an additional $100 billion of imported Chinese products.Mr. Powell only glancingly addressed the March employment report, released Friday by the Labor Department, which showed job growth slowing significantly from January and February and the unemployment rate holding steady at 4.1 percent. The labor market added 103,000 jobs in March — though the monthly average for the year remains above 200,000 — and showed wage growth ticking up slightly.Mr. Powell ticked off several indicators that support the idea that the economy is running near so-called maximum employment, which economists generally consider to be the lowest unemployment rate that does not spur rapid inflation. But he said other indicators, such as labor-force participation that remains depressed by historical standards, suggest that the economy has not yet reached that point. He particularly noted still-lagging wage growth. “I will be looking for an additional pickup in wage growth as the labor market strengthens further,” he said.Fed officials raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at their most recent meeting, in March, to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Officials indicated that they considered the economy and labor market to be healthy, and that they expected to raise rates twice more this year and three times in 2019.Mr. Powell, like his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, cast that gradual series of increases as a carefully planned strategy to ensure that the Fed will not need to raise rates abruptly in the event of a steep rise in inflation. “The F.O.M.C.’s patient approach has paid dividends and contributed to the strong economy we have today,” he said.He closed his prepared remarks by cautioning that events could force the central bank to change course. “Our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook,” Mr. Powell said. “If the outlook changes, so will monetary policy. Our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all Americans — one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation.”Analysts said Friday that they did not see anything in the latest jobs report that would cause the Fed to deviate from its current path.“The Fed will look beyond these temporary disruptions,” said Beth Ann Bovino, chief United States economist at S & P Global Ratings.Analysts at Bank of America Merrill Lynch said Friday that other factors, including subdued inflation data and rising geopolitical risks, could cause Mr. Powell to sound “more cautious” in his outlook."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/26/business/economy/federal-reserve-new-york.html,"When William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, announced that he planned to step down, progressives and pro-labor groups saw a rare opportunity to influence an important economic policy appointment over which President Trump has no say.Almost immediately, they drew up a list of demands. They wanted someone who would focus more on promoting employment than on fighting inflation. They wanted a candidate who reflected diversity and who understood the New York region. They wanted a tough regulator who was independent of Wall Street. And they wanted an open search process that would give the public a voice.Instead, the New York Fed’s board appears to be close to appointing John C. Williams, a Fed insider with little regulatory experience and no close connection to New York. He is also, like everyone to hold the job in the bank’s century of history, a white man.“It’s like Exhibit A of how incredibly out of touch the Fed is with what is important and what’s happening in this country,” said Dennis M. Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a Washington-based group that has pushed for stricter financial regulation.Mr. Williams, the 55-year-old president of the San Francisco Fed, is a respected economist and an influential policymaker whose research has drawn praise even from some people critical of his possible selection. He has helped push the Fed to rethink its approach to monetary policy after the financial crisis, and has argued for policies that could lead the central bank to act more aggressively in the next crisis.Janet L. Yellen, the former Fed chairwoman whom Mr. Williams succeeded as president of the San Francisco Fed, called Mr. Williams a leader on the central bank’s policymaking Federal Open Market Committee, known as the F.O.M.C.“He’s a tremendous contributor to the Federal Reserve and the F.O.M.C., and has done influential research on monetary policy,” Ms. Yellen said.But Mr. Williams’s possible appointment — which isn’t yet final and could still change — drew swift criticism from a variety of Democratic lawmakers, progressive groups and left-leaning economists. They raised concerns about his record as a banking regulator and as a policymaker, and also criticized the search process for a lack of transparency.“The New York Fed should go back and restart their search now,” said Andrew Levin, a Dartmouth College economist who spent 20 years at the Fed.A New York Fed spokesman declined to comment. But in a statement this month, the leaders of the bank’s search committee said they had solicited comment from a variety of groups and had interviewed a range of candidates.In recent years, progressive groups have put increasing pressure on the Fed to diversify its leadership and to become more responsive to public concerns about inequality, slow wage growth and other issues that are outside its traditional mandate of ensuring maximum employment and stable prices. The effort has scored some notable victories, including the appointment last year of Raphael W. Bostic in Atlanta as the first African-American president of a regional Fed bank.Mr. Dudley’s announcement last fall that he would step down represented the movement’s greatest opportunity yet. The president of the New York Fed, unique among the heads of the 12 regional banks, has a permanent vote on the F.O.M.C. and serves as the committee’s vice chairman. The New York bank also plays a crucial role in carrying out the Fed’s policies, and in overseeing many of the country’s largest financial institutions.Those pushing for change had reason to hope their voices would be heard. In the past, the selection of Fed presidents has been heavily influenced by the financial institutions that are formally the stockholders of the Fed’s regional banks. But the regulatory overhaul after the financial crisis removed the banks’ representatives from the selection process. One of the two leaders of the search for Mr. Dudley’s successor is Sara Horowitz, who runs the Freelancers Union, a labor organization. The other, Glenn Hutchins, is a private equity investor.In early March, several dozen protesters marched to the New York Fed’s headquarters in Lower Manhattan to demand an appointee representing workers’ interests. Standing outside the Fed’s imposing stone building on Maiden Lane, Shawn Sebastian, director of the Fed Up campaign, which seeks to make the central bank more responsive to labor concerns, said the board could “make history” by appointing someone without Wall Street ties.“The New York Fed president is the most powerful person in the country that Donald Trump does not get to pick,” Mr. Sebastian shouted to the crowd.Mr. Williams would meet such demands in certain respects. He has spent nearly his entire career inside the Federal Reserve system and, unlike Mr. Dudley, the former chief economist for Goldman Sachs, he has never worked in the finance industry.But Mr. Williams does not have extensive regulatory expertise, and the experience he does have may not help him. He was president of the San Francisco Fed while Wells Fargo, which is based in San Francisco and is partly under the local Fed’s supervision, engaged in aggressive sales practices that resulted in the opening of millions of accounts without customers’ knowledge.In a statement Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, said Mr. Williams’s record in San Francisco “raises several questions, including about his fitness to supervise Wall Street banks.” She said the Fed’s Board of Governors, which must approve appointments, shouldn’t do so for Mr. Williams unless he testifies before the Senate Banking Committee, which has no formal role in the selection process.Fed insiders said Mr. Williams played at most a limited role in the supervision of Wells Fargo, which is primarily overseen by regulators in Washington. Bank supervision would be a much bigger part of his job if he moved to New York. But Donald Kohn, who served as vice chairman of the Fed’s Board of Governors during the financial crisis, said Mr. Williams would hardly be the first president without substantial regulatory experience. Mr. Dudley’s predecessor, Timothy F. Geithner, for example, served in a variety of government roles before joining the Fed, but had never supervised banks.“He’s been sitting in all these Open Market Committee meetings where increasingly financial stability issues are being talked about,” Mr. Kohn said of Mr. Williams.But critics said selecting Mr. Williams would be a missed opportunity to bring in a new perspective. In a commentary for Bloomberg View on Monday that never mentioned Mr. Williams, Senator Cory Booker, Democrat of New Jersey, noted that the New York Fed has never had a woman or a person of color as its leader.“If we’re serious about creating an inclusive and sustainable economy, no one should be left on the sidelines,” Mr. Booker wrote."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/20/business/economy/economy-recovery.html,"Americans have spent much of the past decade wondering when the economy would recover from the crippling Great Recession. Now, they are considering another question: When, and how, will that recovery end?This month is the 10th anniversary of the collapse of the investment bank Bear Stearns, the first stirrings of what became a global financial crisis. Next month, in another milestone, the current recovery will become the second-longest American economic expansion on record.There is no sign that the rebound will end anytime soon. Unemployment is low, job creation is strong and the overall economy seems to be gaining momentum, not losing it. Most economists expect the expansion to continue well into next year, which would make it the longest ever. Many think it could last for years, raising the possibility that President Trump could run for re-election amid the most sustained economic growth in a generation.Even the Federal Reserve’s intention to impose three interest-rate increases this year — with the first expected on Wednesday — has done little to cloud the outlook.But many economists also argue that the seeds of the next crisis are being sown today, even if it is several years before they poke above the surface. Good times are meant to give governments an opportunity to get their fiscal houses in order and address long-term challenges. Instead, the United States is piling on debt and adopting policies — immigration restrictions, increased trade barriers, looser financial regulation — that many economists view as counterproductive.“We’re adding to the structural issues,” said Veronique de Rugy, an economist at the Mercatus Center, a libertarian think tank. “This is the thing that’s the most disconcerting. We’re not just not addressing it, we’re adding to it.”Investors may be starting to worry about whether the recovery could be, if not ending, at least entering a riskier phase. In February, markets tumbled after a report showing unexpectedly strong wage growth revived long-dormant fears of inflation. The markets rebounded but have remained volatile, dropping again this month when Mr. Trump announced plans to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum that are expected to take effect this week.Economists said that any fears investors had would not be unfounded, but might be premature. It is possible that the tightening labor market — the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000 — could force companies to pay higher wages. That could lead to inflation and prompt the Fed to raise rates more quickly than planned, and the tighter credit for businesses and consumers could cause a recession.The likelihood of such a chain of events may have increased in recent months with the Republican tax bill’s passage and the adoption of a big spending package in Congress, which together could pour hundreds of billions of dollars in fiscal stimulus into the economy. Mr. Trump’s tariffs could also increase consumer prices by limiting cheaper imports from abroad.“We already had a tight economy, and then you add fiscal stimulus, and then you add on top of that trade protections,” said Torsten Slok, chief international economist for Deutsche Bank. “It’s close to the perfect storm coming together with these risks of overheating.”So far, the threat remains hypothetical. Inflation has crept up but remains below the Fed’s 2 percent target, and wage growth remains anemic — even the surprising figure for January was later revised down. If inflation does pick up, it will not result in a recession overnight.The impact of a potential trade war is harder to assess. The tariffs announced by Mr. Trump so far are small and unlikely to have much effect on the overall economy. But if he pursues broad-based tariffs against China — something he is reportedly considering — and prompts retaliation by the European Union or other trading partners, the consequences could be much greater.“We know from history that’s lose-lose,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, a pro-trade think tank. “It reverberates throughout the U.S. economy.”Beyond the issue of trade, most experts see few threats likely to derail the recovery in the short term. That is partly because it would take a fairly substantial shock to knock the economy off course. Tax cuts and spending increases may raise the specter of inflation, but they also provide extra insulation against such a shock. Economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal recently put the odds of a recession in the next year at 14 percent.“I think we’re going to go gangbusters for the rest of this year,” said Martin N. Baily, who served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Bill Clinton and is now an economist at the Brookings Institution.Economists are famously terrible at predicting recessions. Few saw the last one coming. And although the current expansion has been durable, it has not been particularly strong. Quarterly annualized growth in gross domestic product has averaged just 2.2 percent since the recession ended, compared with 5 percent for the typical recovery since 1950. The economy has basically experienced a long smolder rather than the kind of rapid conflagration common in the past.“You can look at it with time as your metric and say, ‘Wow, this is really long,’” said Jonathan Golub, chief United States equity strategist for Credit Suisse. “Or you can look at output and say, ‘It’s actually surprisingly weak.’”Some parts of the country have experienced little recovery at all. And many families are still earning far less than they were before the recession. As a result, some economists, especially on the left, argue that policymakers should be less worried about the economy overheating than about the recovery ending too soon.“You just see a pervasive attitude in markets that says, ‘Oh, no, workers are starting to get a piece of the pie, time to take it away,’” said Jared Bernstein, a former economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. who is now with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Lawrence H. Summers, the Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary, said there was evidence that the economy could keep growing without faster inflation. Even a little more inflation, Mr. Summers said, would not necessarily be a bad thing.“A strong, fully employed economy — where firms looking for workers is a larger issue than workers looking for firms — is the best social program we know,” he said. “It is shortages of labor that induce firms to figure out how to train felons, to move beyond their traditional prejudices, to figure out how to skill unskilled workers, to reach into distressed or depressed communities.”That argument puts economists like Mr. Summers and Mr. Bernstein in odd political company. Mr. Trump’s economic advisers — including the incoming head of the National Economic Council, Larry Kudlow — have played down the threat of inflation, and Mr. Trump has indicated in the past that he would like the Fed to keep interest rates low. That could pay electoral dividends: If the Fed allows the economy to accelerate, it could bolster Mr. Trump’s re-election chances, even if it raises the risk of a recession in his second term.So far, the Fed does not seem inclined to cooperate. Jerome H. Powell, the newly appointed Fed chairman, has said he plans to continue the policy of gradual rate increases adopted by his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen. But Mr. Powell hinted in recent congressional testimony that the central bank could be forced to move more quickly if the economy continued to gain strength.“Some of the headwinds the U.S. economy faced in previous years have turned into tailwinds,” Mr. Powell told lawmakers last month.In any case, research has found that economic expansions do not “die of old age.” Rather, they end because something — a policy mistake, an asset bubble, an outside shock — causes them to.Nellie Liang, who led the Fed’s financial stability efforts after the financial crisis, said the United States had stayed out of trouble since then partly because regulators learned lessons that made banks and other financial institutions far stronger.But Ms. Liang said that after years of low interest rates and steady gains, investors could be caught off guard when the economy hits a speed bump.“Recessions don’t have to come every 10 years or so,” Ms. Liang said. But avoiding them, she added, requires vigilance."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/06/business/economy/economy-trade-war-china-trump-tariffs-fed.html,"The rapidly escalating trade conflict with China has upended the prevailing economic dynamic of falling unemployment and faster growth, leaving policymakers and investors scrambling to figure out the way forward.The threat of a trade war loomed over Jerome H. Powell’s inaugural speech as Federal Reserve chairman on Friday in Chicago, even as he tried to focus attention on the fundamental strength of the American economy. Financial markets fell Friday morning after President Trump’s latest salvo against China, then tumbled further after Mr. Powell indicated that the Fed saw no imminent need to adjust its outlook. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the day down 2.2 percent, closing a turbulent week.And there was uncertainty in Washington, where lawmakers, lobbyists and even White House officials struggled to discern how much of Mr. Trump’s move was policy and how much was bluster.The president acknowledged that the trade friction could take a toll. “I’m not saying there won’t be a little pain,” he said in a radio interview on Friday. “But we’re going to have a much stronger country when we’re finished.”The concern over trade was evident at Mr. Powell’s appearance before the Economic Club of Chicago. The Fed chief did not mention tariffs in his speech, but in a question-and-answer session afterward, they were the first topic raised.The Fed chief, who took his post in February, said it was “too early to say” what impact the dueling trade measures would have. “We don’t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be,” Mr. Powell said. But he made it clear that the Fed would watch closely for any sign that the trade dispute was knocking the recovery off course.The trade tensions complicate what was already a tricky task for the Fed. Hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts and spending increases risk fueling inflation, as do wage pressures from a robust labor market. The government’s monthly jobs report on Friday, while more subdued than in recent months, still pointed to a healthy employment picture.Yet policymakers are wary of acting too aggressively to slow the economy at a time when wage growth has been tepid. The Fed’s response has been gradual interest-rate increases.A trade war could act as a drag on economic growth, forcing the Fed to be even more cautious. But tariffs could also raise consumer prices by limiting cheap imports from China and other countries. That could increase the risk that the Fed will lift rates too quickly, choking off the recovery.“There’s an immediate, knee-jerk reaction to tighten policy more,” said Ellen Zentner, chief United States economist for Morgan Stanley.The latest escalation between the United States and China came Thursday evening, when Mr. Trump said he was considering tariffs on an additional $100 billion of Chinese imports. That came on top of the tariffs on steel and aluminum imposed last month and those on $50 billion in Chinese goods that he proposed in recent days. China has responded with its own new tariffs.It is not clear whether Mr. Trump will make good on his latest threats. Larry Kudlow, Mr. Trump’s new top economic adviser, has sought to portray the tariffs as an opening bid in a negotiating process with China, and he told reporters on Friday that “there are all kinds of back-channel discussions going on.”But Mr. Trump’s Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, indicated that tensions had reached a more combustible level. “There is the potential of a trade war,” Mr. Mnuchin said Friday on CNBC. “There is a level of risk that we could get into a trade war.”The trade upheaval threatens to undermine an American economy that is at its strongest point since the financial crisis struck a decade ago. Employers have added jobs for 90 consecutive months, by far the longest streak on record; the unemployment rate, at 4.1 percent, is the lowest since 2000.“The labor market has been strong, and my colleagues and I on the Federal Open Market Committee expect it to remain strong,” Mr. Powell said on Friday, referring to the Fed’s policy group.Wage growth, weak for much of the recovery, ticked up in March, and Mr. Powell said he expected the gains to continue in the months ahead. And while workers would, without a doubt, like to see their pay rise more quickly, the gradual pace is comforting for some investors, who have been watching for any hints that the economy is overheating.In his speech, Mr. Powell said the Fed saw “other signs of economic strength,” citing “steady income gains, rising household wealth and elevated consumer confidence,” which he said would continue to support consumer spending.Other economists agreed, saying that the recently passed tax and spending measures give the economy added momentum. A full-blown trade war might be enough to short-circuit the recovery, they said, but isolated tariffs — even large ones — most likely are not.Certain categories are more vulnerable. Among the retaliatory moves announced by China are new tariffs on soybeans, which could hurt American farmers already struggling with low prices for their crops.The nation’s factories, a sector that Mr. Trump has championed, have become a bright spot in the recovery — a development Mr. Powell underlined on his Chicago visit by touring an incubator for industrial start-ups. But Mr. Trump’s tariffs could force manufacturers to pay more for materials, and China’s countermeasures could hurt their overseas sales.Just the prospect of tariffs — even before they begin to take a direct bite — could hurt the economy if it makes corporate executives reluctant to invest.Becky Frankiewicz, president of ManpowerGroup, a staffing firm, said she was already hearing from clients that they are more hesitant to commit to major projects, at least until they see whether this week’s skirmishes develop into an all-out trade war.“We’re not seeing the impact directly of tariffs yet, but we would say there’s pretty broad conservatism as a result,” she said.Mr. Powell said Fed policymakers, too, were conscious of concerns from corporate executives.“We did hear from a number of business leaders around the country that changes in trade policy had become a bit of a risk to the medium-term outlook,” Mr. Powell said in the question-and-answer session.Continued turmoil in financial markets could begin to hurt spending, especially among higher earners, who are more likely to own stocks. Ms. Zentner said surveys suggested that some high-income consumers had already become more pessimistic as markets have become more volatile.“It’s starting to affect those groups, whose spending is more tied to the stock market,” Ms. Zentner said. “If they simply pause their spending or become more prudent in their spending because of market volatility, it drags down consumer spending in the aggregate.”The effect of all this on the Fed’s thinking won’t be clear until the next policy meeting on May 1 and 2. Fed officials raised interest rates by a quarter of a percentage point at their most recent meeting, in March, to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent. Officials indicated that they considered the economy and labor market healthy, and that they expected to raise rates twice more this year and three times in 2019.Mr. Powell, like his predecessor, Janet L. Yellen, cast that gradual series of increases as a carefully planned strategy to ensure that the Fed will not need to raise rates abruptly in the event of a steep rise in inflation. But he also cautioned that policymakers could change course if necessary.“Our views about appropriate monetary policy in the months and years ahead will be informed by incoming economic data and the evolving outlook,” Mr. Powell said. “If the outlook changes, so will monetary policy. Our overarching objective will remain the same: fostering a strong economy for all Americans — one that provides plentiful jobs and low and stable inflation.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/21/business/economy/federal-reserve-interest-rates.html,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve is widely expected to announce its first interest rate increase of 2018 at the conclusion of its two-day policy meeting on Wednesday as the United States economy continues to strengthen.■ Wall Street analysts surveyed by CNBC unanimously expect the Fed to raise its benchmark interest rate by a quarter of a percentage point, to a range of 1.5 percent to 1.75 percent.■ Fed watchers are divided over how many increases to expect in 2018 as the Fed continues its steady march back toward more historically normal interest rates. Some analysts believe that Fed officials will signal they are on course for a total of three rate increases in 2018, as they did at the Fed’s December meeting. Others expect a turn toward the hawkish, with an indication of four increases.■ This will be Jerome H. Powell’s first policy meeting and news conference as Fed chairman. Mr. Powell, a former Fed governor, succeeded Janet L. Yellen last month. Analysts do not expect him to deviate from Ms. Yellen’s preferred path of slow and steady rate increases, nor to wade too deeply into controversial topics, such as the tariffs announced by President Trump.The Fed, under Ms. Yellen, pursued gradual rate increases and a highly choreographed sell-off of the portfolio of bonds it bought to help prop up the economy after the 2008 financial crisis. Mr. Powell was among the governors who voted for that approach, and he is expected to reaffirm it, particularly if economic growth continues to accelerate and unemployment remains at or below the 4.1 percent level it reached in February.A rate increase this month would make clear the Fed’s gathering confidence in the economy as well as its focus on the potential for inflation, which has remained persistently muted throughout the expansion.“We think Fed officials will view the growth and inflation data in recent months as encouraging,” analysts at Goldman Sachs wrote in a research note ahead of the meeting, “particularly with tax cuts now implemented and with an additional fiscal boost from federal spending arriving this year.”Fed officials indicated in December that they expected to raise rates three times in 2018. Now some analysts say a short-term economic stimulus from Congress — in the form of a $1.5 trillion tax cut and federal spending increases — could push the Fed to add a fourth rate move. On Wednesday, the Fed’s intentions will be reflected in the so-called “dot plot,” which charts the expectations for future rate increases from every member of the Federal Open Market Committee.A potential fourth increase would be motivated by rising concerns about an overheating economy, with such low unemployment that it sets off an inflationary spiral as companies lift wages to compete for scarce workers and increase prices to pay for those higher salaries. A portion of the voting membership of the committee rotates every year among the Fed’s regional bank presidents. The new members tend to worry more about inflation than those they replaced. Even some members who have fretted more about growth than inflation appear to be shifting their calculus.Lael Brainard, a Fed governor who has been less hawkish than many of her colleagues, said in a speech this month that in many ways, “today is the mirror image of the environment we confronted a couple of years ago.”“In the earlier period, strong headwinds sapped the momentum of the recovery and weighed down the path of policy,” she added. “Today, with headwinds shifting to tailwinds, the reverse could hold true.”If the Fed sticks to three planned rate increases this year, analysts will point to lingering uncertainties in the recovery, including structural issues like a ballooning debt load and trade barriers that could turn the economy’s tailwinds back into headwinds.Recent data suggest that economic growth is falling short of expectations for the first quarter. Wage growth appears to be improving, but the signs are mixed. Markets have been rattled in recent weeks by Mr. Trump’s tariff plans and embrace of a potential trade war. The Fed seems unlikely to react strongly to any one of those factors, but taken together, they could prod officials into pushing any additional rate move into 2019.Though this will be his first news conference as Fed chairman, Mr. Powell has already faced tough questioning during two days of congressional hearings in February and March. He struck a careful tone in those appearances, saying he had upgraded his own economic outlook but saw no evidence yet of overheating in the economy.Mr. Powell also offered only gentle criticism of Mr. Trump’s planned tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. He praised free trade in general, while acknowledging that it had hurt some workers by shifting jobs overseas, and added, “The best approach is to deal directly with the people who are affected rather than falling back on tariffs.”Reporters are likely to push Mr. Powell more on that subject, especially with Mr. Trump’s tariffs scheduled to take hold this week and the administration readying a round of trade penalties aimed directly at China. Analysts expect him not to rock markets with any surprise opinions, in line with his performance in front of Congress.“He came off fairly polished in that, as if he wasn’t nervous about being there,” said Tim Duy, a University of Oregon economist who writes the Fed Watch blog. “I would expect him to be similar in this news conference. He’s not going to drop any bombshells.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/11/us/politics/fed-interest-rates-trade.html,"WASHINGTON — Federal Reserve Board policymakers raised concerns at their March meeting about the prospect of the United States heading into a global trade war, zeroing in on potential harm to American farmers such a clash would cause, according to minutes of the meeting released by the Fed on Wednesday.The officials also expressed uncertainty about how newly enacted tax cuts would affect the economy, partly because the cuts are expected to exacerbate the swelling of federal budget deficits, and because some of the cuts are to expire in the years ahead. Policymakers also expressed unanimous, increased confidence in the strength of the country’s economic recovery, even accounting for trade and tax uncertainties.The minutes of the meeting, on March 20 and 21, provide more detail into the concerns being raised by the farm industry about the potential domestic impact of President Trump’s plan to impose a 25 percent tariff on imported steel and 10 percent on aluminum.“Participants did not see the steel and aluminum tariffs, by themselves, as likely to have a significant effect on the national economic outlook,” the minutes read, “but a strong majority of participants viewed the prospect of retaliatory trade actions by other countries, as well as other issues and uncertainties associated with trade policies, as downside risks for the U.S. economy. Contacts in the agricultural sector reported feeling particularly vulnerable to retaliation.”Fed policymakers also said at the meeting that they expected the combination of the tax cuts signed by Mr. Trump last year and a bipartisan congressional deal this year to increase federal spending to give economic output “a significant boost” in the next few years.However, the minutes reflect officials’ uncertainty about how big that boost might be, and when it might come, because there is little historical precedent for such fiscal stimulus when unemployment is so low. The minutes also show that policymakers “suggested that uncertainty about whether all elements of the tax cuts would be made permanent, or about the implications of higher budget deficits for fiscal sustainability and real interest rates, represented sources of downside risk to the economic outlook.”The meeting was the first under the Fed’s new chairman, Jerome H. Powell. At the session’s conclusion,  officials announced that they would raise interest rates for the sixth time since the end of the Great Recession, in the range of 1.5 to 1.75 percent. Officials released economic projections indicating that they expected to raise rates three times next year, more than the two increases in 2019 that they had forecast in December. The Fed said at the time the economy was continuing to get stronger and that the central bank remained on track to keep raising rates gradually. Mr. Powell echoed those sentiments at a news conference after the meeting.The minutes suggest that decision on interest rates generated little controversy: “All participants agreed that the outlook for the economy beyond the current quarter had strengthened in recent months,” and that they expected the annual inflation rate to rise in the months to come.But the minutes say that a “couple of participants” suggested the Fed would benefit from holding off until a future meeting to raise rates, in order to wait for more data to confirm evidence that the rate of inflation was approaching the Fed’s target of 2 percent annual growth.Officials also debated the benefits of the economy’s running hot — with unemployment very low and growth above forecast trends — for a prolonged period of time, weighing the potential for drawing more workers back to the labor force against the risk of financial instability and “significant” inflation growth.Officials seemed to shrug off the increase in stock market volatility in February, attributing it in part to Labor Department reports that the suggested growth in wages — and, with it, inflation — was gaining steam, which could force the Fed to raise rates faster than expected. “Many participants reported that their contacts had taken the previous month’s turbulence in stride,” the minutes read.The official statement released immediately after the March meeting did not mention trade policy concerns, which roiled financial markets after the Trump administration announced its plans to impose tariffs on imported steel and aluminum, as well as on some other Chinese goods. Mr. Powell acknowledged those concerns at his news conference, saying that trade policy had begun to worry business leaders who speak with Fed officials. Still, he played down any immediate threat to growth.“There’s no thought that changes in trade policy should have an effect on the current outlook,” Mr. Powell said at the news conference, adding that could change if a global trade dispute escalated.In a speech in Chicago last week, Mr. Powell elaborated on the Federal Open Market Committee’s concerns during a question-and-answer session.“The discussion about tariffs is at a relatively early stage, and we talked about this at the F.O.M.C. meeting a couple of weeks ago now,” he said. “And people really don’t see yet any implications in the near term for the outlook, because we don’t know the extent to which the tariffs will actually come into effect and, if so, how big will that effect be and what will the timing of it be.”Any negative effects from tariffs could put the Fed in a bind, forcing policymakers to break what Mr. Powell and his predecessors have repeatedly characterized as a delicate balance between supporting economic growth and job creation, and holding inflation to the target growth rate. Economists generally view tariff fallout as stagflationary, meaning it hurts growth and also feeds inflation. Taxes on imported goods raise prices for businesses and consumers, pushing up the inflation rate, while also dampening consumption and economic growth.The minutes suggest that Fed officials are worrying more about that possibility than they have acknowledged publicly: “Most participants also cited trade policy as a source of either uncertainty or downside risk,” the minutes say."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"Stocks were driven sharply higher on the last day of the year by signs that a resolution to the fiscal negotiations in Washington could come within days.Traders hung on every word out of Washington on Monday, sending share prices on a jerky path upward on what is usually a quiet day of trading ahead of the New Year’s Day holiday.It ended up being the best day for American stocks since the middle of November and was enough to push leading indexes into positive territory for December. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index finished the day up 1.7 percent, bringing the year’s gains to 13.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3 percent for the day and 7.3 percent for 2012.The government was expected to go over the so-called fiscal cliff on Monday night, when a package of tax increases and spending cuts was set to start being phased in. But the political signals out of Washington convinced many investors that the White House and Congress would avert the changes that would be most damaging to the economy. “By day’s end, the assumption was that a deal was in hand — minor details needed to be worked out, but a finished product would be in the books within the next few days,” said Daniel Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. “Investors that had spent the last couple of days trading down reversed that trend and took things higher.” Late Monday evening, a tentative deal was reached that would raise taxes on incomes above $400,000.The market’s jump, much of which occurred after an early-afternoon news conference by President Obama, brought an unexpected end to a day that began with continuing bickering in Washington and a sense of foreboding on Wall Street. Stocks had fallen steadily for most of the last week and opened the day trading down.Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the leader of the Republican minority, said late in the day that an agreement was “very, very close.”Stocks could easily lose their gains if either chamber of Congress is unable to pass the compromise that was being negotiated on Monday. Senators said they were hoping to agree upon legislation and pass it along to the House for a vote on Tuesday. Some details of the agreement were still unclear, and the Republican-controlled House could demand changes.The stock markets are closed on Tuesday, and most traders will be back at their desk Wednesday morning after a week of vacations and light trading.Even if there is an agreement, it is unlikely to resolve a separate debate over the limit on the amount the government can borrow. The government hit its self-imposed debt ceiling on Monday, and Treasury Department officials have said they will be able to finance the budget for only a few weeks using emergency measures.Some Republicans have said they want to use the debate over the debt ceiling to extract more spending cuts from Democrats. Investors are preparing for another bout of volatile trading if that happens.The year did end with many market strategists in an optimistic mood about the American economy, once the fiscal talks in Washington are out of the way.“While fiscal policy and political gridlock are negatives, there are other factors that remain supportive of growth, including a modest recovery in housing and further improvements in household balance sheets,” BlackRock’s chief investment strategist, Russ Koesterich, said in a note to clients.The Standard & Poor’s 500 index climbed 1.7 percent, or 23.76 points, to 1,426.19. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3 percent, or 166.03 points, to 13,104.14. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2 percent, or 59.20 points, to 3,019.51."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/us/politics/grand-bargains-give-way-to-legislative-quick-fixes.html,"WASHINGTON — The confusing struggle to head off a national fiscal crisis has made one thing crystal clear: The era of the Big Deal is over.Despite repeated, intense and personal efforts by President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner as well as bipartisan coalitions, gangs of senators, supercommittees, special commissions and wonky outsiders, the grand bargain remains the elusive holy grail of fiscal policy and seems destined to stay that way for now.“We don’t seem to be able to do grand bargains very well,” said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has long been a force for compromise.Some groups have produced the framework for smaller deals and even gained some bipartisan support, particularly the 2010 Simpson-Bowles plan, which fell just short of a 14-vote threshold required to get before Congress. But the alchemy of Mr. Obama and the current Republican-controlled House, not to mention the ideologically diverse Senate, appears hopelessly inhospitable to accomplishing something huge.As Mr. Obama all but acknowledged Monday, big bipartisan legislative dreams seem all but certain to be miniaturized as incremental policy visions.“My preference would have been to solve all these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain, whatever you want to call it,” he said. “Maybe we can do it in stages. We’re going to solve this problem instead in several steps.”Republicans appear to agree. “We’ll continue to work on smart ways to cut spending,” Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on the Senate floor. “But let’s not let that stand in the way.”The list of unrealized goals from Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner’s last attempt at a grand bargain two weeks ago are breathtaking in their number, particularly when compared with the probable outcome of these final Congressional negotiations. Ambitious plans to overhaul the individual tax code, tackle corporate rates, revamp the Medicare program and possibly consider changes in Social Security appear to have given way mainly to a tax increase for big earners.Members in both the House and the Senate said perhaps that was O.K.“We can’t do the task all at once,” said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. “I pushed for a big deal, but in this case this time we can only get the tax piece done, so we need to move we need to get it done.”The downside of incrementalism is apparent every month in Washington, as a new battle emerges and legislative Band-Aids are affixed to fiscal gunshot wounds.While Congress appeared on Monday to be lurching to a deal to avoid significant tax increases for millions of Americans, the emerging patchwork tax deal would push a series of fights into the next Congress, most of them very likely to be marked by the same 11th-hour, rancorous dynamics that have been the signature of every other fiscal deal.Most pressing, Congress will have to come together as early as next month to lift the debt ceiling, which Republicans are already hoping to leverage to eke more spending cuts from Democrats. A similar fight almost led to default in 2011, and damaged the nation’s credit rating.In March, Congress will spar again over a short-term spending agreement to keep the government open, the same sort that led to a near shutdown almost two years ago. It appeared on Monday that scheduled spending cuts to the Pentagon and other parts of government — the result of last year’s debt ceiling agreement — will be delayed for two months, yet another short-term kick of the can. Republicans and Democrats will most likely revisit the recurring question of revenues versus spending cuts when those two months are up.Because the sharply divided 112th Congress and the White House repeatedly eschewed large-scale deals in favor of quick fixes, myriad bills left undone will be in the hands of the 113th Congress, set to convene at noon Thursday.The legislation includes a farm bill to replace the one that has expired, a lapse that may result in soaring milk prices; a transportation bill; a funding mechanism to supplement the waning gas tax reserves to meet infrastructure needs; and even a measure, once completely uncontroversial, to prevent domestic violence.Also left to the new year is a bill to help states hit by Hurricane Sandy. The Senate passed such a measure last week, but House Republicans, as has been the case with every disaster relief bill in this Congress, disagree with Democrats on its level of spending, and a final deal seems unlikely until the next Congress. The House was also set to vote on Tuesday on a quickie measure to deal with dairy prices.Doing business in pieces may end up a productive formula — in the sense that walking 100 miles will still transport a person absent an airplane or a bus — but many outside Congress do not think such halting forward motion should be confused with actual success.“That’s the nature of the dysfunction,” said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. “For the parties, it gives them temporary cover and to fight again on the issues in the next few months. The parties please their base, but the country does not get a solution.”But that seems to be the nature of what constitutes progress in such a sharply divided political world."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/us/chief-justice-roberts-prods-congress-on-fiscal-matters.html,"WASHINGTON — Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. used his year-end report on the federal judiciary to give Congressional budget negotiators a little nudge.“Our country faces new challenges, including the much-publicized ‘fiscal cliff’ and the longer-term problem of a truly extravagant and burgeoning national debt,” he wrote. “No one seriously doubts that the country’s fiscal ledger has gone awry. The public properly looks to its elected officials to craft a solution.”The chief justice said that his branch of the government provided an example of doing much with few resources. The federal judiciary makes do with a budget appropriation of about $7 billion, he wrote, “a mere two-tenths of 1 percent of the United States’ total budget of $3.7 trillion.”“Yes,” he went on, “for each citizen’s tax dollar, only two-tenths of one penny goes toward funding the entire third branch of government!”In the report, Chief Justice Roberts said the judiciary was doing what it could to cut costs in rent, salaries and computer services. The Supreme Court “continues to set a good example,” he said, asking for a smaller appropriation in the last fiscal year than in the previous one. This fiscal year, the request rose slightly, “largely in response to new judicial security needs,” he said. He did not elaborate.An appendix to the chief justice’s report on the workload of the federal courts showed decreases in the Supreme Court’s docket and in the number of cases it is deciding. In the term that ended last year, the number of requests for Supreme Court review dropped by almost two percent from the previous term. The justices issued just 64 signed opinions in the most recent term, down from 75.The federal courts went to great lengths last year in trying circumstances, notably after Hurricane Sandy. “As just one example,” he said, “the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York conducted emergency hearings in Lower Manhattan the day after the storm hit, working in a building without heat or hot water that was only sparsely lit by gas-fueled emergency generators.” Though Chief Justice Roberts did not say so, the Supreme Court also showed fortitude the day the storm hit, hearing arguments when the rest of official Washington was closed.He called on President Obama and Congress “to be especially attentive to the needs of the judicial branch and provide the resources necessary to its operation.”“Because the judiciary has already pursued cost containment so aggressively, it will become increasingly difficult to economize further without reducing the quality of judicial services,” he wrote. “Virtually all of the judiciary’s core functions are constitutionally and statutorily required. Unlike executive branch agencies, the courts do not have discretionary programs they can eliminate or projects they can postpone.”The number of judicial vacancies does not help matters, he went on. “At the close of 2012, 27 of the existing judicial vacancies are designated as presenting judicial emergencies,” he wrote. “I urge the executive and legislative branches to act diligently in nominating and confirming highly qualified candidates to fill those vacancies.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/business/a-year-of-market-gains-despite-political-turmoil.html,"A year ago, some thought 2012 was destined to be the year that the euro zone — and maybe even the entire European Union — broke up. The banks that supported their governments, and that in turn depended on those same governments for bailouts if they went broke, were deemed to be particularly vulnerable to disaster.It did not happen, and while the euro zone countries hardly solved their economic problems, the Continent’s stock markets turned out to be good investments in 2012, with bank shares among the best performers. The same could be said about the United States, where the broad stock market posted double-digit gains and Bank of America shares doubled in 2012, albeit from a very depressed level.Over all, the Standard & Poor’s Euro 350-stock index was up 13 percent for the year, measured in euros, and more than 15 percent measured in dollars. The S.& P. 500 wound up the year with a gain of 13 percent.It may have been typical of 2012 that it was politicians and central bankers — not economic news or corporate developments — that dominated investor attention. As the year ended, the difference was that it was Washington, not Europe, where the squabbles were taking place.For much of the year, it appeared that the European squabbles were leading nowhere, and by midsummer, markets were pessimistic about the outcome. Finally, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, took decisive action to assure that the banks — and the governments that depended on them — would have access to funds. That did not turn around recessionary conditions in much of the euro zone, but it was enough to turn around financial markets. Prices of government bonds in many of the most troubled countries began to rise. Those who bet that Europe would solve its problems did well in the financial markets.The accompanying charts show the performance of stocks in 10 economic sectors in both Europe and the United States, both in 2012 and since Oct. 9, 2007, the day that world stock markets peaked before what would turn out to be a world recession and credit crisis.What stands out is how well financial stocks and consumer discretionary stocks did during 2012. The latter stocks are things purchased by consumers that are likely to do better when the economy is improving. In the United States, the two best such stocks in the S.& P. 500 were PulteGroup, a homebuilder, and Whirlpool, an appliance maker.But while Europe did better in 2012, it remains much farther from recovering all of the losses experienced since the 2007 peak. The American index is just 9 percent lower than that, while the European index is about a third below where it was then. The only sectors that have completely made up their losses on both sides of the Atlantic are health care and consumer staples. In the United States, the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors have also done so, although the latter sector’s performance is largely because of Apple, whose shares are more than three times as high as they were in 2007."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/nyregion/changing-tone-on-disaster-relief-costs-when-its-closer-to-home.html,"Glint-eyed and with a practiced amiability, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Harold Rogers, would have us know that his heart is heavy at our suffering, even as he applies a little Kentucky common sense to New York and New Jersey.Just because the United States Senate approved a $60.4 billion package for the hurricane-ravaged lands of New York and New Jersey last week, don’t expect the Kentucky congressman to move so fast.“That’s the Senate; they do their thing,” Mr. Rogers, a Republican, told reporters recently. “We are scrubbing the numbers, looking at the justifications, being sure we are dealing with the results of the hurricane and not other causes.”I set out in search of other causes on Monday, driving down Father Capodanno Boulevard on Staten Island. I saw houses spun like tops off foundations and strips of siding ripped off once-handsome homes. I saw ruined Barbie dolls and Legos swept in eddies, mountains of debris and the broken skeleton of the vintage 1940s Victory Diner.I knocked at the door of Santo Lisa’s home, which faces the white-flecked Atlantic Ocean. A retired firefighter with the loose-limbed walk of a man accustomed to running toward danger, Mr. Lisa is the sort whom politicians love to pose with after disasters. The same is true of his next-door neighbor, a young firefighter, except that he’s not there now. His home, smashed and leaning sideways, has an “Unsafe — Do Not Enter or Occupy” notice taped to its front door.When Hurricane Sandy howled, Mr. Lisa heard an old woman screaming for help. He ran downstairs to get a thick rope; he planned to wade into ocean waters and run fast as rapids to rescue her. His basement already bubbled with water. He listened until her screams stopped. They found her body later in the marsh behind her home.“New York is getting $60 billion? When? Where?” Mr. Lisa said. “Show it to me. We’ll be O.K., but this was a great neighborhood of cops, firemen and sanitation men. A lot of us are hurting here.”There are few sights less edifying than self-satisfied men giving themselves a fiscal conservative rubdown as a stretch of America lies ruined. United States Senator Dan Coats of Indiana assured the Northeast last week that he cared deeply, even as he tried to surgically remove more than half the hurricane relief package.“An emergency funding bill should focus on the emergency needs of the victims, not the needs of politicians,” he noted primly, adding that loading up an expensive package “with unrelated projects and earmarks for other states is not the way we should use taxpayer dollars.”No doubt the keen-eyed could discover lard in the rescue package. Our politicians are as expert as those of Indiana, South Carolina and Mississippi in mining a budget for riches.The cost of disaster aid has crept up, fueled by the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and Hurricane Katrina, to the point that the Federal Reserve recently found that most cities, whatever their bitter losses, no longer suffer any long-term economic declines from natural disasters.That might be seen as cause for celebration. Or not. Senator Coats has many complaints. Only $9 billion of the Senate rescue package, he says, would be spent in the next nine months. And it should not include money for the Legal Services Corporation.THIS last is a tip-off as to the game afoot, as the Legal Services Corporation long ago achieved Hezbollah status in the Republican cosmology. I nosed around and found that after tornadoes and all manner of disasters in Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky, Legal Services lawyers helped broken families and businesses file insurance, FEMA and unemployment claims.Tug still harder on the yarn ball of these arguments and the filaments come apart. Some money will not be spent quickly? Guilty as charged: It takes many months to fortify boilers and elevators in public housing, to replace subway electrical systems and rebuild nursing homes and beaches.House and Senate Republican leaders seem particularly distressed when our politicians talk of safeguarding our region against the next globally warmed torrent of ocean water. This carries the unwelcome scent of free spending.Representative Rogers is a more practical man when playing locally. After floodwaters ripped through Kentucky in 2010, he announced that he had snared $2 million in federal dollars so various rural hamlets could put up flood walls and diversionary canals.Years ago, as a reporter, I sat in post-Katrina Gulfport, Miss., and listened as Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, crowed of raking in federal aid. I might have felt more enthusiastic had I not just heard his people boast that federal cash would change the “Redneck Riviera” into a more upscale locale.Whatever. In my city, in my region, the musty whiff of disaster hangs heavy, and our politicians talk of keeping neighborhoods whole. That commitment, to quickly rebuilding neighborhoods within reason, offers a good definition of the commonweal."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/business/big-in-2012-but-the-future-is-hazy-for-bonds.html,"The big story in the markets this year was not about stocks.Americans sold off their stock mutual funds, the most popular way to invest in American companies, at the fastest clip since 2008, the year the financial crisis began. That occurred despite the fact that the stock market itself rose steadily; the benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the year up 13.4 percent.Investors have been opting instead for the assumed safety of bonds. Money has been steadily flowing into mutual funds holding bonds of all sorts for the last four years, but the pace accelerated this year. The percentage of household investments in bonds shot up to 26 percent from 14 percent just five years ago, according to Morningstar.Entering the new year, a growing number of professional investors are betting that the craze for bonds has gone too far, perhaps dangerously so, as has been evident in the headlines from the year-end reports from large investment firms. “Bond PAIN in 2013?” Wells Capital Management’s chief strategist asked. “Caution: Turn Ahead,” BlackRock analysts wrote. “The inflection year,” said Bank of America.This is not the first time that analysts have forecast an end to the rally in bond values that has lasted for decades. But previously many of the voices predicting it were pessimists who believed that investors would sell off their bonds when they lost faith in the American government’s ability to pay back its bonds, forcing the government and many other bond issuers to pay higher interest rates. When interest rates rise, older bonds with lower interest rates are worth less.While those previous forecasts have proved expensively wrong, this year the forecasters are being joined by many economic optimists who argue that a strengthening American economy is likely to make investors willing to embrace the risks involved in stocks, luring them out of bonds. The question, they say, is only how quickly it will happen.“Mathematically, it’s next to impossible to get the kind of returns on bonds you’ve seen over the last few years,” said Kate Moore, the chief global equity strategist at Bank of America.When the turn does ultimately come, it is likely to cause pain for at least some of the people who have been investing in bonds in recent years.“You don’t want to be the last one out the door when the trends turn,” said Rebecca H. Patterson, the chief investment strategist at Bessemer Trust. “All good things come to an end and we want to make sure we’re in front of it.”Most of the talk of investors shifting money from bonds into stocks relies first on the assumption that politicians in Washington are able to resolve the current impasse over the so-called fiscal cliff, the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will go into effect if Congress and President Obama do not come to an agreement, and the coming debate over the nation’s debt ceiling. (Late Monday evening, the two sides crept closer to a deal, tentatively agreeing to raise taxes on incomes above $400,000.)But a number of surveys suggest that professional investors are already starting to prepare for a shift. Hedge funds polled by Bank of America said that they had more of their portfolio allocated to stocks than at any time since 2006.All but one of the 13 bank strategists tracked by Birinyi Associates expects stock markets to rise in 2013. When 2012 began, the same strategists were predicting a downturn in share prices. Even among mutual fund investors, there are signs that the flows out of stocks and into bonds have been slowing down recently.The preference for bonds has already been costly for retail investors. Over the last year, most types of American bonds have returned less than an investment in the S.& P. 500. When inflation is factored in, the benchmark 10-year Treasury security is delivering negative returns.But many investors are still rattled by the 2008 financial crisis and the turbulence in the stock markets since then, which have led to wild swings. Over the last five years, all major types of American bonds have done better than leading stock indexes.The Federal Reserve has been engaged in an aggressive effort to buy bonds and drive down interest rates. The long term goal of that program is to encourage banks to lend money and to drive investors out of bonds. But in the meantime, falling interest rates have made bonds more attractive. The Fed has said it wants to keep rates low until 2015, though it could let them rise sooner if the economy picks up faster than expected. The 10-year Treasury hovered near 4 percent in recent years but has stayed below 2 percent for much of 2012.A number of big-name investors say they believe that the low rates and economic uncertainty are likely to endure, giving bonds a continuing attraction. William H. Gross, the co-founder of Pimco, and perhaps the world’s most famous bond investor, said on Twitter that he expected interest rates would fall further in 2013, in part because of continuing growing pains in the American economy.Mr. Gross’s prediction is particularly notable because in 2011 he bet that interest rates would rise, leading him to sell off some of his firm’s Treasury bond holdings. When that bet lost money, Mr. Gross reversed course.Garth Friesen, the chief investment officer at the hedge fund manager AVM, compared the current situation in the United States to the last few decades in Japan, where investors have continually predicted that interest rates will rise and drive down the value of Japanese bonds. Almost all of those predictions proved wrong as slow economic growth continued to push Japanese interest rates down.“More money has been lost trying to predict the rotation out of Japanese bonds than almost anywhere else,” said Mr. Friesen.But Mr. Friesen says he does believe that the returns from bonds will be lower than they have been in recent years. A Bank of America global bond index has returned 6 percent over the last year, 17 percent over the last three years and 32 percent since 2007.Most of the predictions that interest rates will stabilize or turn around are based on the belief that an improving American economy will help push unemployment lower, restore confidence in American companies and encourage inflation to start to rise. If inflation does go up, it will make current bond holdings less attractive.There is growing evidence this is already happening. In addition to the rising stock market, housing prices have begun to move up and unemployment has been trending down.Ms. Patterson said that this shift was likely to occur slowly, giving investors time to sell off their bond investments without sustaining any significant losses. What is more, a turn in interest rates will not cause the same problems for all bond holders.Investors who hold bonds directly will continue to collect regular interest payments and will receive back their entire initial investment, the principal, when the terms of the bonds expire. But for people who frequently buy and sell bonds, including mutual funds, the value of the bonds they currently hold will go down when interest rates rise.Even among bond mutual funds, some types are expected to continue to do well if and when interest rates rise. Bonds that are issued to provide loans to banks generally do well when rates rise. Among corporate bonds, investments in high-yielding speculative companies — so-called junk bonds — generally do better in times of rising rates than bonds issued by companies with high credit ratings.But all of this calculus could be thrown on its head if the doomsayers are right and interest rates rise quickly at some point. That could happen if, say, there were serious military tensions in the Middle East and oil prices spiked suddenly. It could also occur if investors lose faith in the ability of the United States government to pay back investors who buy its bonds.Tad Rivelle, the head of bond investing at TCW, said that the Federal Reserve’s current policy was most likely to fail and kill confidence in Treasury bonds, forcing the government to pay higher interest rates to borrow. But even if the Fed succeeds, Mr. Rivelle said, interest rates will end up in the same place.“Whether Fed policy succeeds or fails, rates are ultimately going to be going significantly higher,” said Mr. Rivelle."

While it’s true that a low credit score could be indicative of spending habits that are diametrically opposed to yours, it’s more likely an indication of today’s economic landscape.When I met my husband five years ago, he was recovering from a divorce that devastated him financially, and his credit score was very bad. I had a six-figure income, made three times what he did and had a credit rating in the high 700s.Well guess what? Since that time he’s gone to school, improved his job and struggled to bring the credit rating up. I lost my high-paying job, am making a third of what I used to and considered bankruptcy.I still technically have a “good” credit rating, but it really doesn’t reflect my financial status. You could be making six figures and have a bad credit score or vice versa.Bottom line: Next time one of these shallow guys ask for your credit score on a first date, tell him you’ll share it after he shows you his bank account.LISA GOLDHAMEREdison, N.J., Dec. 26, 2012To the Editor:How cheering it was to read about sharing credit scores.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/world/asia/china-builds-a-railroad-and-laos-bears-the-cost.html,"OUDOM XAI, Laos — Wang Quan, the new Chinese owner of a hotel in this farm town tucked into the tropical mountains of northern Laos, is hoping that the first of 20,000 Chinese workers will arrive here soon to start construction on a new railroad.The Chinese-financed railway is to snake its way through dozens of tunnels and bridges, eventually linking southern China to Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, and then on to the Bay of Bengal in Myanmar, significantly expanding China’s already enormous trade with Southeast Asia.But Mr. Wang may have to wait a little longer to make his fortune from all the Chinese expected to descend on this obscure corner of Laos about 50 miles from the nearest border with China. Even though the project has run into some serious objections from international development organizations, most experts expect it to go ahead anyway. That is because China considers it vital to its strategy of pulling Southeast Asia closely into its orbit and providing Beijing with another route to transport oil from the Middle East.The crucial connection would run through Oudom Xai between Kunming, the capital of China’s southern province of Yunnan, and the Laotian capital, Vientiane.“China wants a fast-speed rail — Kunming to Vientiane,” George Yeo, a former foreign minister of Singapore, said in a recent speech to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations Business Club in Bangkok.Mr. Yeo, chairman of Kerry Logistics Network, a major Asian freight and distribution company, is considered one of the best-informed experts on the expansion of new Asia trading routes. “The big objective is Bangkok,” he said. “It’s a huge market, lots of opportunities. From there, Bangkok to Dawei in Myanmar — that will enable China to bypass the Malacca Straits,” a potential choke point between the Indian Ocean and China’s east coast.But China is not particularly interested in sharing much of the wealth the railroad would generate. Most of the benefits, critics say, would flow to China while most of the costs would be borne by the host nation. The price tag of the $7 billion, 260-mile rail project, which Laos will borrow from China, is nearly equal to the tiny $8 billion in annual economic activity in Laos, which lacks even a rudimentary railroad and whose rutted road system is largely a leftover from the French colonial era.In mid-November, when Prime Minister Wen Jiabao of China visited Vientiane for a summit meeting of European and Asian leaders, he was expected to attend a groundbreaking for the railroad. The ceremony did not take place.An assessment of the rail project by a consultant for the United Nations Development Program said the terms of the financing offered by China’s Export-Import Bank were so onerous they put Laos’s “macroeconomic stability in danger.” At the same time, construction through northern Laos would turn the countryside into “a waste dump,” the consultant’s report said. “An expensive mistake” if signed under the terms offered, the report concluded. As collateral for the loan, Laos was bound to provide China with minerals, including potash and copper.Other international donors echoed the findings. “Partners, including the Asian Development Bank and the World Bank, expressed concern, and the International Monetary Fund was here and said, ‘You have to be very careful,’ ” said an Asian diplomat briefed on the reservations expressed to the Laotian government.Nonetheless, the National Assembly has approved the project as part of a much broader trans-Asian rail agreement signed by nearly 20 Asian countries in 2006. While the workings of the Communist Party that runs Laos are extremely opaque, diplomats here said, the project is most strongly backed by the pro-China deputy prime minister, Somsavat Lengsavad. Efforts to interview Mr. Somsavat were unsuccessful.China’s exploding trade with Southeast Asia reached nearly $370 billion in 2011, double that of the United States in the same year. By 2015, when the Southeast Asian countries aim to have completed an economic community, China projects that its trade with the region will equal about $500 billion.Even as it exports a variety of goods to the region, China relies on imports from its neighbors in Southeast Asia — natural resources and intermediate goods — to fuel its export machine, said Yolanda Fernandez Lommen, principal economist for the Asian Development Bank in Beijing.The European Community, the United States and Japan are still China’s largest trading partners, she said, but “Southeast Asia is geostrategically and economically important to China, an increasingly important partner from both the trade and investment perspectives.”Laos offers a perfect launching pad for China’s stepped-up regional ambitions. China has poured new investments into the capital, including in dozens of luxurious villas built on the banks of the Mekong River to house the European and Asian leaders who attended the November summit meeting.A fancy new convention hall, part of a new complex called Vientiane New World, gives a 21st-century veneer to the shabby capital. In Luang Prabang, a popular tourist destination through which the railroad will run, China has built hospitals and upgraded the airport.Some Laotians, unhappy with the unmistakable Chinese presence, complain that their country is becoming little more than a province of China or, more slyly, a vassal state.Veterans of the Pathet Lao, the guerrilla movement that fought alongside North Vietnam during the Vietnam War, dominate a government that keeps its distance from Washington. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton visited in July, the first visit by the United States’s top diplomat since the 1950s. The move was part of the Obama administration’s effort to forge stronger economic and military ties in the region as a counterweight to China.In Laos, opposition to government policies is often squelched. The director of Helvetas, a Swiss development organization, was expelled on 48 hours’ notice last month, accused of an unfriendly attitude to the government. The director, Anne-Sophie Gindroz, had raised the issue of the government’s forcing peasants to sell their land at very low prices, a practice that is now seen as mainly serving the interests of Chinese-financed developers.In Vientiane, the well-known Laotian director of a civil society group, the Participatory Development Training Center, disappeared last month after taking part in a People’s Forum where land issues were discussed on the sidelines of the November summit meeting. Diplomats said the director, Sombath Somphone, appeared to be in police custody.Despite the sudden opposition to the Chinese railroad, a manager of a Chinese state-owned company in Vientiane, who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the press, said he had every expectation that it would go ahead. He said Hu Jintao, China’s departing president, “made the decision two to three years ago.”A foreign diplomat agreed, saying that Vientiane and Beijing would find a way to paper over their financing dispute. “The Chinese will have their way,” he said.Here in Oudom Xai, where a Chinese language school founded by Chinese businessmen has 400 students and 28 teachers, some paid by the Chinese government, Mr. Wang, the hotel owner, expresses confidence that the project will start within the next few weeks. Since arriving in Laos three years ago, Mr. Wang said, he has also acquired a wood processing plant.Chinese immigrants have leased about half of the agricultural land around the town, he said.“You can rent land for however many years you have money for,” Mr. Wang said. “People here recognize money, not people.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/business/global/chinese-manufacturing-sector-expanded-in-december.html,"An important gauge of China’s giant manufacturing sector published Tuesday showed a third successive month of expansion in December and underlined the view that the world’s second-largest economy has settled into a mild rebound that is likely to extend into 2013.A survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector, released by the national statistics bureau on the first day of the new year, produced a reading of 50.6 points for December. Figures above 50 mean the sector is growing, while those below suggest contraction.A similar survey released by HSBC on Monday painted a similar picture of solidifying recovery. That index, which is more focused on smaller, privately held businesses than its official counterpart, came in at 51.5 - a full point above the November reading, and the highest in 19 months.After a marked slowdown during much of 2012, the Chinese economy began to regain some momentum during the last few months of the year. A modest increase in exports, combined with government-induced infrastructure spending and other economy-supporting measures, dissipated fears of a ‘'hard landing'’ during the final quarter of 2012. Analysts widely expect the economy to have expanded about 8 percent in 2012, and to record similar or even slightly stronger growth in 2013.At the same time, however, analysts caution that the Chinese economy will need to grapple with a host of major challenges and that growth is likely to slow by several percentage points over the next decade.‘'Looking forward, China’s cyclical rebound still faces strong headwinds,'’ Li-Gang Liu and Louis Lam, economists at ANZ, commented in a research note on Tuesday. ‘'Economic and policy uncertainties in the U.S. and the E.U. suggest that external demand for Chinese exports will remain sluggish.'’Domestically, the government is grappling with rampant corruption and environmental degradation, a widening gap between rich and poor, and the need to reduce the dominance of state-owned enterprises. For growth to be sustainable, the economy will also need to become more driven by domestic demand, rather than government-induced investment and exports, analysts believe.China’s rapidly changing demographics — an aging population will cause the proportion of non-earners to soar in the coming years — is adding considerable time pressure.‘'The problem is not so much how to maintain short-term growth momentum, but how to prepare China for the demographic challenge ahead,'’ Yao Wei, an economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong, said at a media briefing in last month. ‘'Within ten years, China will have worse demographics than South Korea or Japan. The window of opportunity for policymakers is closing very quickly,'’ she added."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/a-new-breed-of-republicans-resists-the-fiscal-deal.html,"WASHINGTON — Just a few years ago, the tax deal pushed through Congress on Tuesday would have been a Republican fiscal fantasy, a sweeping bill that locks in virtually all of the Bush-era tax cuts, exempts almost all estates from taxation, and enshrines the former president’s credo that dividends and capital gains should be taxed equally and gently.But times have changed, President George W. Bush is gone, and before the bill’s final passage late Tuesday, House Republican leaders struggled all day to quell a revolt among caucus members who threatened to blow up a hard-fought compromise that they could have easily framed as a victory. Many House Republicans seemed determined to put themselves in a position to be blamed for sending the nation’s economy into a potential tailspin under the weight of automatic tax increases and spending cuts.The latest internal party struggle on Capitol Hill surprised even Senate Republicans, who had voted overwhelmingly for a deal largely hashed out by their leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The bill passed the Senate, 89 to 8, at 2 a.m. on Tuesday, with only 5 of the chamber’s 47 Republicans voting no.Twenty-one hours later, the same measure was opposed by 151 of the 236 Republicans voting in the House. It was further proof that House Republicans are a new breed, less enamored of tax cuts per se than they are driven to shrink government through steep spending cuts. Protecting nearly 99 percent of the nation’s households from an income tax increase was not enough if taxes rose on some and government spending was untouched.A party that once disputed that there was any real “cost” of tax cuts encountered sticker shock when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting them in place of the “fiscal cliff” provisions would cost $4 trillion over 10 years.“I personally hate it,” Representative John Campbell, a Republican from California, said of the bill. “The speaker the day after the election said we would give on taxes, and we have, but we wanted spending cuts. This bill has spending increases. Are you kidding me?”By all accounts, the tax deal negotiated by Mr. McConnell and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is one of the most sweeping fiscal policy changes in a decade, a measure that would bring a certainty to the tax code long demanded by the financial community and taxpayers.The bill’s heft was confirmed on Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office, which said the income and business tax cut extensions; new capital gains, dividend and estate tax rates; and unemployment compensation would add an estimated $4 trillion to the federal deficit compared with where the government would be if Congress did nothing to halt the tax increases and spending cuts that were triggered at the start of the year.The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that measured against extending all 2012 policies, the deal would cut the deficit by $650 billion over 10 years. The group said the biggest cost, a “patch” to the alternative minimum tax to prevent it from suddenly affecting much of the middle class, should not be considered a cost at all because Congress has adjusted it each year anyway.But the Congressional Budget Office’s estimate gave even some Democrats pause, especially since the bill would make permanent virtually all of the Bush tax cuts — a goal that Mr. Bush chased through the rest of his presidency. “For four years in my town hall meetings across the state, Coloradans have told me they want a plan that materially reduces the deficit,” said Senator Michael Bennet, one of three Democrats who voted against the bill. “This proposal does not meet that standard and does not put in place a real process to reduce the debt down the road.”The bill would do much more than head off the automatic tax increases and spending cuts. It would fix in place a tax code that for more than a decade has caused struggles over regular sunset provisions, temporary solutions and fleeting incentives. The bill would finally make permanent five of the six income tax rates created in 2001 by the first Bush tax cut. It would codify Mr. Bush’s successful push, in 2003, to make tax rates on dividends and capital gains equal so that one form of investment income is not favored over the other.But it would let lapse a two-percentage-point cut in the payroll tax, one of the recent tax policy changes most squarely aimed at the working class, meaning take-home pay may be less even if higher income taxes are headed off. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, estimated that 77 percent of Americans could pay more over all to the federal government this year.“For me, this is very much an ‘on the one hand, on the other hand’ thing,” said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary in the years of Mr. Bush’s tax fights. “As a Bush loyalist, it’s fantastic that the Bush tax cuts, which now have to be seen inarguably as overwhelmingly for the middle class, are being made permanent. On the other hand, it’s inarguable that this adds $4 trillion to the federal debt.”The 10-year price includes $762 billion to lock in the Bush tax rates of 10 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent, along with some of the Bush-era 35 percent bracket; $354 billion to continue Mr. Bush’s expanded child credit; and $339 billion to secure Mr. Bush’s 15 percent capital gains and dividend rates for families earning less than $450,000. Fixing the alternative minimum tax would cost the Treasury $1.8 trillion, according to the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.Democrats say they had little choice. The Bush White House and Republican Congresses structured the tax cuts so that letting them expire would be politically difficult. Add the across-the-board spending cuts if Congress did nothing, and President Obama felt he had to extend most of the tax cuts or watch the economy sink back into recession.“New occasions make for new truths,” said Representative Danny K. Davis, a Democrat from Illinois and a veteran of the partisan wars over the Bush tax cuts. “New situations make ancient remedies uncouth.”Most galling for Republicans are provisions projected to add $330 billion in spending over 10 years, including $30 billion in unemployment compensation and $21 billion in payments to Medicare health providers. None of those provisions are objectionable on their own, but collectively they almost proved impossible for Republicans to accept.Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts, R. Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist, was not crowing about their potential enshrinement. He said some Bush-era policies were no longer relevant to the task of tailoring a tax code to a properly sized government.The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts “are not the best anchoring point” for that debate, he said. “We need a tax system that can promote economic growth and raise the revenue the American people want to devote to government.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/politics/some-liberals-say-obama-squandered-his-tax-leverage.html,"WASHINGTON — For President Obama, the fiscal deal passed by Congress on Tuesday finally ends four years of debate with Republicans about raising tax rates on the wealthy. But it seemed to reopen a debate within his party about the nature of his leadership and his skills as a negotiator.While Mr. Obama got most of what he sought in the agreement, he found himself under withering criticism from some in his liberal base who accused him of caving in to Republicans by not taxing the rich more. Just as Speaker John A. Boehner has been under pressure from his right, Mr. Obama faces a virtual Tea Party of the left that sees his compromise as capitulation.The main difference is that in the Obama era, the Democratic establishment has been less influenced, or intimidated, by the left than the Republican establishment has been by the right. Liberals have not mounted sustained primary challenges to take out wayward incumbents the way conservatives have. All but three Democrats voting in the Senate and 16 in the House supported the compromise on Tuesday, even as most House Republicans balked, giving Mr. Obama more room to operate than Mr. Boehner.But the wave of grievance from liberal activists, labor leaders and economists suggested that the uneasy truce between Mr. Obama and his base that held through the campaign season had expired now that there was no longer a threat of a Mitt Romney victory. It also offered a harbinger of the president’s next four years.The criticism has irritated the White House, which argued that Mr. Obama held true to principle by forcing Republicans to raise income tax rates on the wealthy and extend unemployment benefits and targeted tax credits. Mr. Obama also quashed Republican demands to trim the growth of entitlement benefits. Aides dismissed armchair criticism from those who have never had to negotiate with intractable opposition.“There’s some frustration that over time you would think everybody would have a better understanding of the parameters of this,” said Robert Gibbs, a longtime adviser to Mr. Obama who once called such critics “the professional left.” “But he understands now probably better than at any other point in his presidency what it means to be a leader, what it means to have to do things that are good not just for one party but good for the country.”The criticism from the left mirrors past complaints when Mr. Obama included tax cuts in his stimulus package, gave up on a government-run option in health care negotiations and temporarily extended Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy two years ago. Liberals said Mr. Obama should have capitalized on his re-election victory and the expiration on New Year’s Day of all of the Bush tax cuts to force Republicans to accept his terms.“The president remains clueless about how to use leverage in a negotiation,” said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal advocacy organization. “Republicans publicly admitted they lost the tax debate and would be forced to cave, yet the president just kept giving stuff away.”Robert B. Reich, the former labor secretary, said that Mr. Obama “has stiffened his tactical resolve” but that “he’s still the same President Obama who wants a deal above all else and seems willing to compromise on even the most basic principle.”Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in a Twitter message on Monday that the agreement was “not a good fiscal cliff deal if it gives more tax cuts to 2 percent.” Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said on the floor on Monday that “this looks like a very bad deal.”Still, most Democratic lawmakers accepted it, however reluctantly, concluding that voting against it could cause greater economic disruption. Many liberals grew more comfortable once they learned more about the deal, and the revolt on Tuesday by House Republicans seemed to rally them behind the plan and against a common adversary. Mr. Trumka released a new statement hailing elements of the deal, while blaming “Republican hostage taking” for its flaws.Mr. Obama succeeded in forcing Senate Republicans to raise the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent despite their adamant opposition, although he agreed to apply that to household income above $450,000, instead of $250,000. He also won an increase in taxes on wealthy estates to 40 percent from 35 percent, though it was not as high as liberals wanted.The bill will extend unemployment benefits for two million Americans; renew tax credits for child care, college tuition and renewable energy production; raise capital gains taxes; and phase out deductions for the wealthy. Mr. Obama also insisted that a two-month postponement of automatic spending cuts be financed by $1 in tax revenue for every $1 in spending reductions.“When the dust settles, there will be a lot of important elements in this for progressives,” Mr. Gibbs said. The deal can be evaluated only in combination with the result of the next fiscal talks, to be concluded by the end of February, he said, adding, “We won’t know the final score on that until you look at both of those negotiations together.”Defenders of the White House said it was ludicrous to expect that the president would not have to compromise, given that Republicans control the House and have enough votes in the Senate to filibuster a bill. Without an agreement, economists warned that the country would have been pushed back into recession.Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said Mr. Obama had secured important victories like the one on unemployment benefits and stood firm against paring entitlement benefits. “The president was strong there,” he told CNN. “And I think he’ll continue to be strong. I think, you know, I notice a different president since he won this election.”Jared Bernstein, a former economics adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Mr. Obama had done what he thought he had to, but he expressed concern that the president might have squandered leverage unless he holds firm in the debate over the debt ceiling. Republicans want to use a vote to raise the ceiling to force Mr. Obama to accept deeper spending cuts, but the president has vowed not to negotiate over the borrowing limit.“While some appear to think his team folded in the cliff debate, I don’t see it that way,” Mr. Bernstein said. “They saw a plausible path forward, and they took it. My point is it’s only plausible if they really don’t get derailed on the debt ceiling debate.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/arts/television/bill-pullman-keeps-his-passions-out-front.html,"If only he’d arrived a couple of centuries earlier, Bill Pullman might be considered, well, a little less odd.Instead, he lamented good-naturedly the other day, his life appears to be “a patchwork quilt of bizarre, disparate obsessions.” An actor in more than 50 films, he has a fondness for trombones, vaudeville and things agricultural — like cattle, barns, tractors and, the subject of a lot of attention lately, his orchard.“If I were born in the 1700s, I would look like a rounded man,” he said in a phone interview from his dwelling in the Hollywood Hills, with its terraced grove of more than 100 varieties of fruit-bearing plants. “Jefferson defined a home as being a house and a garden. I think I was born out of my time.”He considered for a moment. “Well, maybe the time is coming back to me.”Or maybe it’s already here. On Jan. 10 Mr. Pullman, 59, will tackle his first lead in a comedy series — and his second as commander in chief, after the 1996 film “Independence Day” — when he stars as President Dale Gilchrist in “1600 Penn” on NBC.On Jan. 17 he’ll open the Sundance Film Festival as an American diplomat who re-enters the life of his estranged daughter for her wedding in Jordan in the drama “May in the Summer,” starring Cherien Dabis, who wrote and directed it.But it’s “The Fruit Hunters,” Yung Chang’s documentary about zealots pursuing the exotic and the succulent to the ends of the earth, that was giving Mr. Pullman pause. The movie, inspired by the 2008 book by Adam Leith Gollner, will have its American premiere at the Palm Springs International Film Festival on Friday.“Who is the greatest actor in film right now?” Josh Gad, a creator and a star of “1600 Penn,” recalled being asked by an acting teacher when he was a student at Carnegie Mellon University.“And she said, ‘Bill Pullman, because he has this unbelievable ability to swing the pendulum and capture the essence of humanity in every one of his roles,’ ” he said.That humanity may be captured nowhere quite as lucidly, or as self-consciously, as in “The Fruit Hunters,” in which Mr. Pullman — gravelly voice and fathomless eyes on full display, along with a closetful of plaid shirts — holds his own among the cultivators, smugglers and epicures whose lustiest ardor seems reserved for a mouthful of flesh and juice.Here he is at a Florida auction, bidding hundreds of dollars for a plate of mangoes. There he is in Hawaii, bushwhacking through the jungle in search of ice cream bean and water apple and bilimbi.“I know Bill Pullman as a veteran Hollywood actor, but I’m not sure that acting is really his main passion,” Mr. Chang says in the voice-over.Mr. Pullman said: “I didn’t bust him on that, but people are always touching different parts of the elephant, and they think they define the elephant. Some people think I’m obsessed with working with old tractors, others see that in my free time I’m putting on these vaudevilles, and Yung gets to think that I’m obsessed about fruit.”“The thing about acting is it’s the one that lets me get immersed in the other things,” he added. “I always come back to acting.”Mr. Chang’s assumption is understandable. In 2009, as he was pondering a way to translate into film Mr. Gollner’s book — a paean to the world’s myriad, frequently awe-inspiring fruits and those who have worshiped them — he read a New York Times profile that included a tour of Mr. Pullman’s orchard.“I immediately felt this punch in the gut that perhaps fate was calling,” Mr. Chang said. “And Bill, without knowing anything about my background, invited us out to his home and asked us to stay with him for a week to find an angle in.”The film shows Mr. Pullman toiling in his orchard and later in his kitchen as he gleefully concocts white sapote ice cream: “Get ready to have a taste sensation that I know you have never had before, chez Bill.”That so much of his home — and himself — is on display has incited a bit of after-the-fact consternation.“It’s more about privacy,” Mr. Pullman said. “I don’t like this instinct of reality television to wear your lifestyle in public. I’ve really always loved the anonymity of things.”Still, he was prepared to let down his guard for the sake of the Hollywood Orchard, a nonprofit, neighborhood-centric organization he helped found in 2011 that gleans unpicked fruit from trees to be donated to food pantries or processed at pop-up cooking facilities on the street.“What is it Hemingway said?” Mr. Pullman asks in the film. “ ‘You can only love one woman and one piece of land truly in one lifetime.’ ”The woman is easy. The land is trickier. In the early 1990s, a decade after he stopped teaching theater at Montana State University, Mr. Pullman bought a ranch near Cardwell, Mont., and last summer presented a vaudeville show about the drought in a garage he’d transformed into a performance space, near a barn he’d converted into a house. It includes a suspended performance floor for his wife of 26 years, the dancer Tamara Hurwitz Pullman, with whom he has a daughter and two sons.In Hartsville, N.Y., a few miles from his hometown, Hornell, Mr. Pullman turned another barn into a community center, where he has hosted tractor square dancing, in which the machines do-si-do and promenade the way people would on foot. Banners symbolize solidarity: red for International Harvester, orange for Allis-Chalmers and green for John Deere.“It was so gonzo,” he said. “The men drove, and the women carried flags, and they looked like mighty Amazon goddesses coming in.”Not far away is the site of Mr. Pullman’s first orchard, planted when he was 13, a few years after his mother, a nurse, had her first psychiatric breakdown, and his father, a doctor, was dealing with problems of his own.An orchard meant serenity, he said. An orchard meant health.Late in “The Fruit Hunters,” Mr. Pullman shakes a branch of one of the 18 trees there, “a zone that you could create and control, when everything else was out of control,” he recalls. He picks up an apple, takes a bite and gazes heavenward.“This is good,” he says."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/world/europe/used-to-hardship-latvia-accepts-austerity-and-its-pain-eases.html,"RIGA, Latvia — When a credit-fueled economic boom turned to bust in this tiny Baltic nation in 2008, Didzis Krumins, who ran a small architectural company, fired his staff one by one and then shut down the business. He watched in dismay as Latvia’s misery deepened under a harsh austerity drive that scythed wages, jobs and state financing for schools and hospitals.But instead of taking to the streets to protest the cuts, Mr. Krumins, whose newborn child, in the meantime, needed major surgery, bought a tractor and began hauling wood to heating plants that needed fuel. Then, as Latvia’s economy began to pull out of its nose-dive, he returned to architecture and today employs 15 people — five more than he had before. “We have a different mentality here,” he said.Latvia, feted by fans of austerity as the country-that-can and an example for countries like Greece that can’t, has provided a rare boost to champions of the proposition that pain pays.Hardship has long been common here — and still is. But in just four years, the country has gone from the European Union’s worst economic disaster zone to a model of what the International Monetary Fund hails as the healing properties of deep budget cuts. Latvia’s economy, after shriveling by more than 20 percent from its peak, grew by about 5 percent last year, making it the best performer in the 27-nation European Union. Its budget deficit is down sharply and exports are soaring.“We are here to celebrate your achievements,” Christine Lagarde, the chief of the International Monetary Fund, told a conference in Riga, the capital, this past summer. The fund, which along with the European Union financed a bailout of 7.5 billion euros for the country at the end of 2008, is “proud to have been part of Latvia’s success story,” she said.When Latvia’s economy first crumbled, it wrestled with many of the same problems faced since by other troubled European nations: a growing hole in government finances, a banking crisis, falling competitiveness and big debts — though most of these were private rather than public as in Greece.Now its abrupt turn for the better has put a spotlight on a ticklish question for those who look to orthodox economics for a solution to Europe’s wider economic woes: Instead of obeying any universal laws of economic gravity, do different people respond differently to the same forces?Latvian businessmen applaud the government’s approach but doubt it would work elsewhere.“Economics is not a science. Most of it is in people’s heads,” said Normunds Bergs, chief executive of SAF Tehnika, a manufacturer that cut management salaries by 30 percent. “Science says that water starts to boil at 100 degrees Celsius; there is no such predictability in economics.”In Greece and Spain, cuts in salaries, jobs and state services have pushed tempers beyond the boiling point, with angry citizens staging frequent protests and strikes. Britain, Portugal, Italy and also Latvia’s neighbor Lithuania, meanwhile, have bubbled with discontent over austerity.But in Latvia, where the government laid off a third of its civil servants, slashed wages for the rest and sharply reduced support for hospitals, people mostly accepted the bitter medicine. Prime Minister Valdis Dombrovskis, who presided over the austerity, was re-elected, not thrown out of office, as many of his counterparts elsewhere have been.The cuts calmed fears on financial markets that the country was about to go bankrupt, and this meant that the government and private companies could again get the loans they needed to stay afloat. At the same time, private businesses followed the government in slashing wages, which made the country’s labor force more competitive by reducing the prices of its goods. As exports grew, companies began to rehire workers.Economic gains have still left 30.9 percent of Latvia’s population “severely materially deprived,” according to 2011 data released in December by Eurostat, the European Union’s statistics agency, second only to Bulgaria. Unemployment has fallen from more than 20 percent in early 2010, but was still 14.2 percent in the third quarter of 2012, according to Eurostat, and closer to 17 percent if “discouraged workers” are included. This is far below the more than 25 percent jobless rate in Greece and Spain but a serious problem nonetheless.“I’m always asking people here, ‘How can you put up with this?’ ” said Juris Calitis, a Latvian-born Anglican chaplain whose family fled Soviet occupation in the 1940s and who returned when the Soviet empire crumbled.“It is really shocking,” added Mr. Calitis, who runs a soup kitchen at his church in Riga’s old town. Latvians, he said, “should be shouting in the streets,” but “there is an acceptance of hard knocks.”Latvia has certainly had plenty of those, enduring Soviet, Nazi and then renewed Soviet rule, learning that discontent is best kept quiet. After Moscow relinquished control in 1991, decrepit Soviet-era plants shut down, gutting the industrial base. The economy contracted by nearly 50 percent.The collapse of Latvia’s largest bank in 1995 wiped out many people’s savings. Latvia then was hit by debris from Russia’s financial blowout in 1998. Then came a dizzying boom, fueled by a lending splurge by foreign, particularly Swedish, banks, followed by a catastrophic slump as credit froze when the global financial crisis swept into Europe in 2008.“Conditions were very tough,” recalled Mr. Dombrovskis, but few people resisted his argument that harsh austerity offered the only way out.In contrast to much of Europe, Latvia today has no tradition of labor activism. “What can you achieve in the street? It is cold and snowing,” said Peteris Krigers, president of the Free Trade Union Confederation of Latvia. Organizing strikes, he said, is nearly impossible. “It is seen as shameful for people who earn any salary, no matter how small, to go on strike.”Also largely absent are the leftist political forces that have opposed austerity elsewhere in Europe, or the rigid labor laws that protect job security and wage levels. In the second half of 2010, after less than 18 months of painful austerity, Latvia’s economy began to grow again. Other European countries “should not miss this point,” said the prime minister, noting that the “debate in Europe often goes the opposite way: that austerity destroys growth.”Yet the pain of many ordinary people continues.“They say the crisis is over, but I don’t feel that,” said Marika Timma, a mother of three whose husband lost his job in construction when the property bubble burst. Ms. Timma used to work as a cleaner but quit when her wages were cut in half, to just $168 a month.Several of her good friends have emigrated to Britain and Ireland to look for work. “They won’t be coming back,” she said.Since 2008, Latvia has lost more than 5 percent of its population, mostly young people, to emigration. The recent exodus peaked in 2010, when 42,263 people moved abroad, a huge number in a country of just two million now, according to Mihails Hazans, a professor at the University of Latvia.Daniels Pavluts, Latvia’s economics minister, recently visited Dublin and London and met with émigré associations to encourage his compatriots to come home. Latvia’s economy, Mr. Pavluts said, “is now doing well” and “offers a future.”Alf Vanags, director of the Baltic International Center for Economic Policy Studies here, is skeptical. “The idea of a Latvian ‘success story’ is ridiculous,” he said. “Latvia is not a model for anybody.”A better and more equitable way out of Latvia’s troubles, he believes, would have been a devaluation of the currency, an option closed to Greece and 16 other countries that use the euro. Latvia kept its currency pegged to the euro, putting itself in much the same straitjacket as euro zone nations.But Latvia’s high pain threshold and unusually open economy set it apart, enabling a relentless squeezing of wages, said Morten Hansen, head of the economics department at the Stockholm School of Economics in Riga.“You can only do this in a country that is willing to take serious pain for some time and has a dramatic flexibility in the labor market,” he said. “The lesson of what Latvia has done is that there is no lesson.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/nyregion/billions-in-aid-for-hurricane-sandy-victims-in-danger-of-stalling.html,"A bill to provide tens of billions of dollars in federal aid to states pummeled by Hurricane Sandy was in danger of dying Tuesday night as the House seemed headed for adjournment without taking up the legislation.The developments in the House dealt a major blow to leaders from the storm-battered region, who had been pushing top Republicans in the chamber to adopt a $60.4 billion aid package that the Senate passed last week.Lawmakers and a top Republican aide said late Tuesday that Speaker John A. Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, appeared unwilling to introduce any Hurricane Sandy aid legislation before the chamber adjourns in the next day or so. If the legislation is not introduced before the session ends, it would have to be reintroduced in the new Congress and passed by both chambers.The developments came after days in which top House Republicans left open the possibility that they would take up an aid package after coming under intense pressure from political leaders and lawmakers from the storm-ravaged region.The storm spending bill was apparently a victim of bad timing. It has been eclipsed by negotiations between Democrats and Republicans over a plan intended to avert a series of tax increases and spending cuts that automatically took effect in the New Year.As word spread that the leadership would not consider any storm spending package this session, a procession of New York and New Jersey lawmakers went to the House floor Tuesday night to denounce the Republican leadership, in particular the speaker.“This is absolutely indefensible,” said Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island. “We have a moral obligation to hold this vote.”Representative Nita M. Lowey, a Democrat from Westchester County, echoed the sentiment. “I truly feel betrayed this evening,” she said. “We can pass this bill tomorrow with bipartisan support.”In the Senate, there was equal dismay. “It is truly heartless that the House will not even allow the Sandy bill to come to the floor for a vote, and Speaker Boehner should reconsider his ill-advised decision,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York. The $60.4 billion bill would cover an assortment of pressing needs. It includes money to help homeowners and small-business owners rebuild; to repair bridges, tunnels and transportation systems; to reimburse local governments for overtime costs of police, fire and other emergency services; and to replenish shorelines.That package would fall far short of the $82 billion that governors from New York, New Jersey and Connecticut have said would be needed to continue cleaning up and rebuilding after the storm.But leaders from the region nonetheless embraced it as a good start that would enable local governments, businesses, homeowners and others hurt by the storm to undertake rebuilding projects with the confidence that federal aid was on the way."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/business/economy/a-bigger-tax-bite-for-most-households-under-senate-plan.html,"WASHINGTON — Only the most affluent American households will pay higher income taxes this year under the terms of a deal that passed Congress on Tuesday, but most households will face higher payroll taxes because the deal does not extend a two-year-old tax break.The legislation, which was forged in the Senate and overcame resistance in the House late Tuesday will grant most Americans an instant reversal of the income tax increases that took effect with the arrival of the new year. Only about 0.7 percent of households will be subject to an income tax increase this year, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. The increases will apply almost exclusively to households making at least half a million dollars, the center estimated in an analysis published Tuesday.But lawmakers’ decision not to reverse a scheduled increase in the payroll tax that finances Social Security, while widely expected, still means that about 77 percent of households will pay a larger share of income to the federal government this year, according to the center’s analysis.The tax this year will increase by two percentage points, to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent, on all earned income up to $113,700.Indeed, for most lower- and middle-income households, the payroll tax increase will most likely equal or exceed the value of the income tax savings. A household earning $50,000 in 2013, roughly the national median, will avoid paying about $1,000 more in income taxes — but pay about $1,000 more in payroll taxes.Sabrina Garcia, a 35-year-old accounting assistant from Quincy, Mass., who together with her husband made about $102,000 last year, said the payroll tax increase equated to “about $200 a month for my family.”“That’s a lot of money for us,” Ms. Garcia said. “It means we will have to cut back.” She said in an e-mail exchange that she will most likely will postpone buying a new computer. “And forget about being able to save money,” she added.The deal will impose larger tax increases on those who make the most. It will raise taxes in two ways: by restoring limits on the amount of income affluent Americans can shelter from federal taxation, and by returning to a top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent. The current rate is 35 percent.For married couples filing jointly, the deduction limits apply to income above $300,000, while the top tax rate kicks in above $450,000. But both numbers are somewhat misleading, because “income” in this context is a technical term, referring only to the portion of income subject to taxation after exemptions and deductions.Few households with actual incomes of less than half a million dollars will face a tax increase. The Tax Policy Center calculated that less than 5 percent of families earning $200,000 to $500,000 will actually pay more.The size of those increases will be much smaller than President Obama originally proposed. The net effect, according to the center’s estimates, is that the top 1 percent of households will see an average income tax increase this year of $62,000 rather than $94,000. “The high-income people really are doing very well in this compared to what the president wanted to do,” said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.The deal passed by the Senate and the House will impose fewer limits on deductions than the White House plan. It will also tax income from dividends at a flat rate of 20 percent, rather than the same marginal rate as earned income. And there is another important point, often misunderstood: Affluent households will pay the new 39.6 percent rate only on income above $450,000. They and everyone else will still will pay lower rates on income below that threshold.Households making $500,000 to $1 million will pay an additional $6,700 in taxes on average. Those making more than $1 million will pay an additional $123,000 on average.Changes in the estate tax will also benefit affluent families. The tax will not apply to the first $5 million of an inheritance, extending the current exclusion rather than reverting to the $3.5 million threshold that President Obama initially favored. However, wealth above that amount will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent rather than the previous rate of 35 percent.The Obama administration did win a five-year extension of tax breaks for lower-income families, including the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit. Those credits eliminate income tax liability for many lower-income families. In many cases, the government actually makes a direct payment to the family to help offset the burden of payroll taxation — up to $1,000 a child under the child credit and up to $5,900 total under the earned income credit.The deal will also restore unemployment benefits for about two million Americans. People who can’t find work, and have already received government checks for the standard period of 26 weeks, have been able to stay on the rolls for up to an additional 47 weeks. But financing for that program, which is aimed at the states with the highest unemployment rates, expired Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, people who are eligible will receive any missed benefits retroactively.The deal also includes new rules for the alternative minimum tax, which threatened this year to impose higher taxes on roughly 30 million households. The tax was created in the 1960s to set a lower limit on the taxes paid by the most affluent households, but the eligibility threshold was not indexed to inflation, so it theoretically encompasses a larger share of households with each passing year. Congress has repeatedly passed short-term increases in the threshold; the deal will make those increases automatic, obviating the annual ritual.That is small consolation for middle-income Americans like Joe Interlandi, 61, a long-haul trucker who on Tuesday was driving a load of tomatoes from Florida to Los Angeles.Mr. Interlandi, writing from a rest stop, said he understood the need for higher taxes. He will rather pay more now than impose higher taxes on his children and grandchildren, he said.But Mr. Interlandi, who estimated that he worked 100 hours many weeks, added that the payroll tax increase still meant he will need to spend even more time on the road. Describing things he will have to cut back on, he wrote, “Family outings like vacations, and time together.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/technology/tech-giants-learning-the-ways-of-washington-brace-for-more-scrutiny.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation’s capital and overseas.In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans’ video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings.But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking.Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation — meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack — that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry’s main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that the chairman of the commission itself, Jon Leibowitz, will step down.The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration.“Now that the election is over, Silicon Valley companies each are thinking through their strategy for the second Obama administration,” said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official. “The F.T.C. will have a new Democratic chairman. A priority for tech companies will be to discern the new chair’s own priorities.”In early 2012, an unusual burst of lobbying by tech companies helped defeat antipiracy bills, which had been backed by the entertainment industry. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google feared that the bills would force them to police the Internet.At the end of the year, Silicon Valley also got its way when the Obama administration stood up against a proposed global treaty that would have given government authorities greater control over the Web.The key to the industry’s successes in 2012 was simple: it expanded its footprint in Washington just as Washington began to pay closer attention to how technology companies affect consumers. “Privacy and security became top-tier important policy issues in Washington in 2012,” said David A. Hoffman, director of security policy and global privacy officer at Intel.“Industry has realized it is important to be engaged,” he continued, “to make sure government stakeholders are fully informed and educated about the role that new technology plays and to make sure any action taken doesn’t unnecessarily burden the innovation economy while still protecting individual trust in new technology.”At the end of 2012, tech companies were on track to have spent record amounts on lobbying for the year. In the first three quarters, they spent close to $100 million, which meant that they were likely to surpass the $127 million they spent on lobbying in 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that tracks corporate spending. Even the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz hired a lobbyist in Washington: Adrian Fenty, a former mayor of the city.Technology executives and investors also made generous contributions in the 2012 presidential race, luring both President Obama and Mitt Romney to Northern California for fund-raisers and nudging them to speak out on issues like immigration overhaul and lower tax rates.In a blog post in November, the center said Silicon Valley’s lobbying expenditures have ballooned in recent years, even as spending by other industries has fallen.Facebook more than doubled its lobbying outlay in the year, reporting close to $2.6 million through the third quarter of 2012. Google spent more than any other company in the industry, doling out more than $13 million in the same period and more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft, which spent just over $5.6 million in the same period.Among Google’s advocates on Capitol Hill is a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari, who heads Google’s office in Washington.Google has particular reason to be engaged. It faces a wide-reaching antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, just as Microsoft did a decade ago. At issue is whether Google’s search engine results favor Google products over its rivals’.Although the agency was ready to settle that case before the holidays, without harsh remedies, late last month it shelved the inquiry and put stronger penalties back in play. A resolution is expected in January.The commission has already fined Google on a separate matter. In 2012, the company paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser to track users and serve them targeted advertisements.Facebook has vastly expanded its Washington presence in recent years. It has set up a political action committee, hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties and offered tips to lawmakers in an effort to make its site indispensable to politicians seeking re-election.Facebook scored a win on Capitol Hill in late 2012 when it nudged Congress to amend a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, that had protected the privacy of Americans’ video rental records. Facebook and its partner, Netflix, the video streaming service, advocated for changes in the law so that movies watched on Netflix could be shared on Facebook. That kind of data can be valuable for behavioral advertising, a principal source of revenue for Web services like Facebook.The company also attracted increased scrutiny from the F.T.C. The agency negotiated a consent order with Facebook to settle charges that it had engaged in “unfair and deceptive practices” when changes in its settings revealed personal information that Facebook users had regarded to be private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to audits of its privacy policies for 20 years.Facebook faced renewed public outcry last month when its subsidiary, Instagram, proposed to deploy users’ pictures to serve targeted advertisements. The company has backtracked on that proposal, but the outcry, say consumer privacy advocates, is an indication of public sentiment.“Yes, the industry managed to hold off privacy legislation this year,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “But if the end-of-year protests over the Facebook and Instagram changes are any indication, users will be pressing for better privacy protections in the next Congress.”Silicon Valley’s lobbying efforts are also likely to expand across the Atlantic in 2013. Both Facebook and Google have faced off with European regulators over privacy issues. Now, the European Parliament is weighing an overhaul of data protection laws that apply across the Continent.One of the proposed changes requires Web companies to ask European Union citizens for their explicit consent before collecting personal data for targeted Web advertising. Web companies vigorously oppose that and other proposals."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/business/economy/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"With the House of Representatives approval of a fiscal agreement late Tuesday, investors were expecting a rally in the markets to start the New Year. But the surge was not expected to last long, with investors and economists quickly shifting their focus to several hurdles the economy faces in the coming months.“We could see an early lift in the markets because of relief the deal went through,” said Gary Thayer, the chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. “The response may be muted because the deal left out many long-term issues.”Market strategists were forecasting that even the deal approved by the Senate early Tuesday and by the House late Tuesday  night would reduce economic growth by as much as 1 percent in the first quarter of 2013. Much of this would come from a rise in payroll taxes on incomes under $113,700 that would affect about 77 percent of American households.Then there are the fiscal disagreements that Congress did not try to address in its negotiations this week. Spending cuts of $110 billion were delayed for two months, and politicians have not come up with a long-term solution that would allow the government to get past the borrowing limits reached at the end of the year — known as the debt ceiling.“We keep stumbling from patchwork solution to patchwork solution, without getting us to the longer term solutions we need,” said Michael Gapen, the head of economic research for the United States at Barclays.Technically, the country went over the so-called fiscal cliff on Tuesday, when markets were closed for the holiday. But the compromise reached later Tuesday should retroactively cancel the tax increases that began.American stock indexes saw their biggest jump in over a month on Monday in anticipation of a deal moving swiftly through Congress. In early trading on Wednesday, leading indexes rose 2.6 percent in Hong Kong and 1.2 percent in Australia.“If Congress just comes close to their most modest expectations, investors tend to cheer that,” said Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research. “A lot of investors are suffering from battered investor syndrome.”Many economists say that if politicians are ultimately able to reach a more lasting budget agreement, it could allow the focus to turn to signs of improvement in both the United States and global economies. Asian markets have been propelled higher in recent days by data showing that China’s manufacturing sector was continuing to expand. In the United States, housing prices have been moving higher and unemployment rates lower.This has led many economists to forecast stronger growth for the second half of 2013 — around 2.5 percent — but only after the weight of the tax increases and budgetary debates are out of the way. In the last few weeks, signs of economic strength have allowed investors to respond with a bit of a shrug to the impasse in Washington. The benchmark Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index ended the month of December up, and finished the year 13.4 percent higher.Many investors are also likely to be happy with the portions of the Congressional agreement that deal with tax rates on dividends, which are now set to rise to 20 percent from 15 percent, less than President Obama had proposed. This could produce some demand for dividend-paying stocks, particularly given then the rates will be put in place permanently.Congress also surprised some economists by agreeing to extend unemployment benefits for more than 2 million people, and by making changes to the Alternative Minimum Tax that will avert higher tax bills for middle-income households.But, as expected, Congress decided to allow the payroll tax to rise to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent. That is likely to immediately crimp the spending power of American consumers, and take about $120 billion out of the economy in 2013.In the longer term, investor uncertainty heading into the new year underscored the degree to which Wall Street has become consumed by a seemingly never ending series of battles in Washington, in which one budget dispute bleeds into another.The most severe crisis came in the summer of 2011, the last time the government reached its borrowing limit. Congress ultimately came up with a solution that allowed the government to continue taking on more debt, but only by pushing off the hardest decisions to the end of 2012. The Senate and House votes on Tuesday night put off many of those same decisions until March. At that point, the Treasury Department says it will no longer be able to use extraordinary measures to borrow enough money to operate the government.The compromise this week also delayed $110 billion in cuts to the defense budget and other government programs until March. If there is no further agreement at that point, those cuts will begin to be phased in, amounting to another hit to the economy.Even if the debt ceiling and budget cuts are resolved in March, politicians could put off again any long-term answer to the ballooning government deficit and debt problems that are most worrisome to many economists.  “The markets are very quickly going to appreciate that this does not remove this cloud of fiscal uncertainty, it just briefly defers it,” said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. “I can see no reason that debate should be less divisive than the debate we’ve just had.” "

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/garden/market-ready-mixing-old-and-new-cabinetry.html,"Q. Our lower kitchen cabinets need to be replaced due to water damage, but the upper cabinets are still in good shape. Is it O.K. to mix new and old cabinetry?A. In most cases, it should be possible to replace only the lower cabinets and still have a cohesive-looking kitchen that’s appealing to buyers. “It’s acceptable as long as they don’t look too different,” said Frances Rickard, a real estate agent with City Connections Realty in Manhattan. “Even if they are different styles, there’s a few feet of space between upper and lower cabinets, and the wall brings it all together.”But try your best to get as close a match to the originals as possible, she said. “They should be the same size,” she noted. “If you have a white wood, you should get a similar white wood.”Barbara Cannizzaro, the owner of Josephine Design, an interior design firm in Belle Harbor, N.Y., agreed that it’s possible to give a kitchen a desirable new look even while retaining the existing upper cabinets.But first, she noted, consider that replacing lower cabinets may be more expensive than you think. “When you change out lower cabinets, you also involve countertops and plumbing” for the sink and dishwasher, she said. She recommended replacing the cabinets only when necessary.If you proceed, Ms. Cannizzaro advised selecting a simple design in a neutral color like white, or cherry wood. “You can easily find a low-cost base cabinet at Ikea or Home Depot,” she said.Then consider transforming the upper cabinets. Ms. Cannizzaro suggested painting them with a product like Benjamin Moore’s Advance. “If you did a simple white base cabinet, you could paint the upper cabinets charcoal gray, or a neutral color like a taupe,” she said.Using different neutral colors top and bottom, “gives a layered feel,” while making the difference between cabinets appear intentional, she said. “Contrast can be your friend.”A second option, she said, would be to remove the upper doors, paint the open cabinets and install glass shelving.With either change, she recommended unifying the upper and lower cabinets by installing the same type of hardware.If your new lower cabinets require new countertops, “you don’t have to break the bank,” she added, noting that Ikea sells inexpensive butcher-block wood countertops. “If you put that in and it’s new and mint, it can look really high-end.”While you’re renovating, it’s an ideal time to consider other deficiencies, Ms. Cannizzaro noted. “If you have a ratty looking stove, you might want to consider an appliance upgrade,” she said.When selecting new cabinetry, countertops or appliances before a sale, she added, there’s one rule of thumb to follow: “Simpler is always better because you’re looking to appeal to the widest possible range of buyers.”TIM McKEOUGH"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/your-money/piecing-together-a-tax-plans-effects.html,"It is tempting for people who earn less than $400,000 to think that they got off easy this week under the tax deal to end the fiscal impasse, given that only those with incomes above that level will be in a higher income tax bracket in 2013.But the legislation that both houses of Congress have now approved could increase taxes on people with incomes that are not quite that high as well. That’s because the bill includes language that begins to do what both President Obama and Mitt Romney proposed at various points in the past: Limit certain tax breaks available to people who are affluent.The new rules target two tax breaks: personal exemptions and many popular deductions like those for state and local taxes, mortgage interest and charitable contributions. For both breaks, single people with at least $250,000 in adjusted gross income and married people filing jointly with at least $300,000 in income are vulnerable. A hypothetical Texas couple could end up paying about $2,500 more in taxes, for instance.The mechanics of how the new limits will work are now clear, though it takes a fair bit of explaining to lay them out in plain English. What we don’t know yet is how many people will end up paying more in 2013 than they did in 2012.The uncertainty is tied to the fact that many of the targets of the legislation often end up ensnared by the alternative minimum tax. The A.M.T., and its high tax bill, may continue to catch most of them.But let’s start with the basics. Most of the discussion here begins with that adjusted gross income figure. That’s the number you get when you subtract items from your salary or take-home pay that are often referred to as above-the-line deductions.For the income range we’re talking about, these deductions tend to include things like health savings account contributions and alimony. People who work for themselves also get deductions for health insurance premiums, certain retirement contributions and self-employment taxes that an employer would otherwise pay.Mark Luscombe, principal analyst with CCH, a tax information provider, points out just how confusing the use of adjustable gross income is, given that the new tax limits, the new tax bracket and the new Medicare tax are all based on different definitions of income.Under normal circumstances, a personal exemption, for a specific dollar amount, is available for each member of your household. You then add all of the exemptions and subtract the total from your adjusted gross income, which has the effect of lowering your taxable income. CCH predicts that the personal exemption amount for 2013 will be $3,900 per person.The new law requires taxpayers in the targeted income range to reduce the amount of their exemptions by 2 percent for every $2,500 by which their income exceeds the $250,000 or $300,000 limit. So a married, childless couple with $400,000 in adjusted gross income and $7,800 in potential exemptions could lose $6,240 of that $7,800.The math for the limit on deductions is different. There, the rules call for you to add up the applicable deductions. Let’s say that equals $50,000. Then, you subtract from that 3 percent of the amount by which your adjusted gross income exceeds those $250,000 or $300,000 thresholds.So if you’re a married couple with $400,000 in income, you’re $100,000 over the threshold. Three percent of that is $3,000. So you’d subtract that from $50,000. The rule, which existed for years but had been phased out more recently, is known as the Pease limitation, for Representative Donald J. Pease, the Ohio newspaper editor-turned-legislator who got it passed. As before, you can’t lose more than 80 percent of your deductions, no matter how high your income gets.If you’re trying to figure out whether and how this may affect you, well, join the club. So much depends on your income, your state and your various deductions. All of that will affect whether the A.M.T. hits you as well.For people who are already in the A.M.T. but will not end up with the $400,000 (for individuals) or $450,000 (for married couples filing jointly) in income necessary to be in the new 39.6 percent tax bracket in 2013, the new exemption and deduction rules may not hurt you. “I don’t think there’s enough there that you would no longer be in the A.M.T.,” said Jude Coard, a tax partner at Berdon L.L.P., of people with income in the $300,000 to $400,000 range.Much will depend on your own situation. CCH ran two hypothetical cases for me, which you can see in the accompanying graphic. The first examined a family of four in New York with $400,000 in adjusted gross income and $79,000 in total itemized deductions. The household pays the A.M.T. in both 2012 and under the new tax rules in 2013. They pay just $790 more in 2013, but that includes $1,350 in new Medicare taxes. (The total does not include the Social Security payroll tax that has been restored to its prerecession level.)A family in Texas, however, might have the same income but lower property taxes and no income tax and thus lower deductions for its federal tax return. Their deductions are just $43,700, but they end up being hurt more by the new rules. They would have no A.M.T. liability in 2013 and would end up paying $3,852 more, or about $2,500 if you don’t count the $1,350 from the new Medicare tax.This is a lot to digest, so much so that even the experts at the Tax Policy Center have not yet finished updating their online calculator. Once they do, if you have the stomach to gather (or try to predict) all of the data, you can take your shot at projecting what these new rules may cost you."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/opinion/the-new-tell-all-fed.html,"ChicagoWITHIN moments of their release on Thursday afternoon, the minutes from the Federal Reserve’s December policy meeting caused a bond-market sell-off. Yields on Treasury bonds jumped as traders quickly dumped 10- and 30-year government bonds.What was the profound economic news that caused this mini-convulsion in the market? Did the minutes reveal a weak spot in the nation’s economic-growth prospects? Was word of December’s employment numbers, scheduled for announcement on Friday, somehow leaked?No. What spooked traders was surprise. The Fed minutes revealed deeper divisions within the central bank’s ranks about the Fed’s aggressive bond-buying efforts than many observers had supposed.The events in the bond market today are an instructive lesson in the power of communication: when the Fed speaks, the fewer surprises, the better.In the 1990s, those who hoped to divine the Fed’s next move would study the girth of Alan Greenspan’s briefcase. If the Fed chairman’s worn black satchel appeared to be bulging, many believed that a new monetary policy action was imminent. If not, then no change was foretold.Until that time, the Fed chairman, governors and regional Fed bank presidents, like most central bankers around the world, gave few, if any, hints about the group’s long-term thinking on interest rates and strategies for regulating the nation’s money supply — decisions that would ultimately affect the borrowing costs for tens of millions of Americans. And when the Fed did speak, it was mostly in impenetrable syntax-bending tidbits of Delphic inscrutability.The grand tradition of the oracular tight-lipped central banker, however, ended with a bang last month, when the current Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, said it would keep short-term interest rates near zero at least as long as the unemployment rate remained above 6.5 percent and as long inflation and inflation expectations continued to be contained. As the meeting minutes released on Thursday showed, this was a controversial change within the Fed; most of the group wanted to give an explicit unemployment threshold rather than continue the traditional approach of elegant vagueness — but not all.All of this may seem like mumbo-jumbo to those unfamiliar with the jargon of monetary policy. But to veteran Fed watchers, this was a “Real Housewives”-level of candor.Strong arguments can be made for whether or not it’s appropriate for the Fed to continue its extraordinary effort to stimulate the economy by flatlining interest rates, by buying up Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities and by flooding the economy with bank reserves — a policy known as quantitative easing. I believe the two previous rounds helped to prevent a 1930s-style deflation from taking hold but share the group’s concern, as revealed in the December minutes, that “the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased.” (It was that concern — that the program of asset purchases could be cut short — that caused the ruckus in the markets on Thursday.)But that said, the fewer surprises and mixed messages in communication there are, the more likely the Fed’s efforts to shore up the American economy will be effective. In this regard, the central bank’s newest strategy of talking about itself — and notably, of its decision to tie its interest-rate moves to an unemployment threshold — is a great step forward in economic stewardship. Now, everyone knows what criteria Fed officials are using to guide future policy.As stark as this move to transparency may seem, it has actually been some two decades in the making. An unlikely proponent was Mr. Greenspan himself when, under his chairmanship, the Fed began to issue brief explanations after each monetary policy meeting, including the votes of each member of the Federal Open Market Committee, the central bank’s policy body. This was in contrast to the first eight decades of the Fed’s existence, when the Fed would simply buy or sell securities in the market to try to affect credit conditions — so-called open market operations — without acknowledging its actions or revealing its intentions.Under Mr. Bernanke, lips have loosened rapidly with quarterly news conferences, forecasts by F.O.M.C. members of key economic indicators, countless testimonies before Congress and, now, the explicit adoption of a 2 percent inflation goal.The advantage of such glasnost is that it can give the Fed greater bang for its buck. Buying more government bonds may bring down interest rates today, but getting people to believe that the Fed will continue such “accommodative” policies adds to the potency of its actions in two ways: expectations of future borrowing costs stay low, and uncertainty about future monetary policy (and hence, future borrowing costs) declines. Such knowledge lets firms be more confident about investing and hiring, and gives homeowners and potential home buyers more faith that mortgages will stay affordable, providing support for the housing market.Still, for the open-mouth strategy to work, the words must be consistent with the direction of the policy action, otherwise those words can sabotage the impact of the actions. That’s the lesson we learned from the Bank of Japan.After the Japanese economy declined in the early 1990s and fell into deflation, the Bank of Japan dropped interest rates to nearly zero and embarked on a huge asset-purchase program (the pioneering “quantitative easing” program). The actions were on a much larger scale relative to G.D.P. than what the Fed has done.Japan’s central bank, however, made the mistake of emphasizing that these purchases were only temporary and would be reversed at the first signs of the proverbial “green shoots” of recovery. Despite the bank’s large-scale asset purchases, the uncertainty that these statements created undermined confidence and the willingness to borrow. The bank’s words spoke louder than actions.The highest priority in the economic revival plan of the newly elected prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is to strong-arm the Bank of Japan into acknowledging that it will do simply “whatever it takes” to reverse deflation there and allow a recovery to take root.Mark J. Carney, the head of Canada’s central bank and soon to be the governor of the Bank of England, also seems to be embracing the “whatever it takes” theory of communications: tying monetary policy to a single measure of overall economic health (like nominal income) rather than multiple metrics (inflation, inflation expectations, unemployment numbers) that may be even easier to understand.The Fed might well consider alternative economic indicators as it assesses whether its interventions are reducing uncertainty and promoting recovery. But the key, it seems, is to be forthcoming about its thinking with the American people. For now, the bank’s smart, calibrated open-mouth policy has been a step in the right direction.That old black satchel of Mr. Greenspan’s, meanwhile, ought to get a prominent spot in the Smithsonian."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/opinion/dereliction-of-duty-more-fiscal-battles-ahead.html,"Republicans won more in the fiscal-cliff deal than they had any right to expect. Permanent tax cuts for the middle class and millions of wealthy families, a permanent break on the estate tax and dividends, a five-year limit on tax credits for low-income families, and only a single year of extended unemployment insurance. Yet 64 percent of House Republicans voted against it Tuesday night.Their explanations reeked of tired ideology about never raising anyone’s taxes and the lack of spending cuts. If not for Speaker John Boehner’s last-moment decision to allow the bill to pass without a Republican majority, everyone’s income taxes would have gone up.The unwillingness of Mr. Boehner’s caucus to join such decisions for the common good suggests that the 113th Congress, which begins on Thursday, will be bitterly unproductive, and possibly even more dangerous than the last Congress. Republicans say they are more determined than ever to extract the maximum amount of budget-cutting pain in the next two months by threatening not to raise the debt ceiling.That’s a far more serious prospect than going over the fiscal cliff. Letting the Treasury run out of borrowing authority would mean a default on the nation’s credit, a catastrophic prospect for holders of government bonds around the world. It could result in further credit downgrades and lead to sharply higher borrowing costs. It is an unimaginable prospect for a responsible country, yet it almost happened in 2011 because of the irresponsibility of Congressional Republicans.Mr. Obama sounded resolute on Tuesday night in vowing he will not submit to this blackmail. “I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they’ve already racked up through the laws that they passed,” he said. But will he really keep this promise?The White House won several victories in the fiscal-cliff package, but its eagerness for a deal disappointed many who believed the president’s promise to raise far more revenue. It is hard to see how he avoids giving in to Republican demands, as he was forced to do in 2011.Mr. Obama has also said he will demand equivalent revenue increases for every dollar of spending cuts won by Republicans over the next year. That could be done by further limits on deductions and loopholes for corporations and the rich, including eliminating the carried-interest loophole that lets hedge fund managers declare that their income is a form of capital gains. But it will be a struggle to uphold that pledge, given the maddening nature of his opponents.In the weeks to come, Republicans will use not just the debt-ceiling threat, but also the $100 billion across-the-board cuts known as the sequester, delayed for two months in this week’s deal, and the potential shutdown of the government when the current spending resolution expires in March. Standing up to brinkmanship will require a level of resolve that the president has yet to fully demonstrate."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/business/after-tax-deal-economists-see-drag-on-growth.html,"Even though Congress’s last-minute deal means higher taxes for almost all Americans, businesses and consumers are relieved that some of the uncertainty about what they will owe the government this year is gone.“Once something gets settled, even if it’s not the most popular settlement option, it still gives you a sense of what the rules are and what you need to do to readjust,” said Sam Ramey, the owner of Sultan Mediterranean Cafe in North Andover, Mass., who says he hopes the deal will bolster the spirits of his customers.“It’s not that you say ‘Today I’m not buying a sandwich because of all the uncertainty,’ but if you don’t feel that ease of mind that lets you go out and buy a sandwich, you don’t go out and buy a sandwich,” he said.Congress’s compromise on taxes eliminates some uncertainty. But there’s no getting around the outcome that it will also reduce how much consumers have available to spend on dining out and other discretionary expenses.Altogether, the end of the payroll tax holiday, the income tax increase on the wealthiest Americans and other provisions will probably shave 0.7 to 1.5 percentage points off economic growth in 2013, estimate many economists. They are forecasting growth in output this year of just over 2 percent, almost identical to that of 2012.The housing rebound, the natural gas boom, looser credit for small businesses, pent-up demand for new cars and other encouraging trends will be tempered by the fiscal tightening, though not nearly as much as if taxes had risen as they were scheduled to do without a deal.“We’ve definitely averted the worst-case recession scenario,” said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse. “We’re still looking at some fiscal drag, but it’s an amount the economy can absorb.”The tax deal is also expected to result in hiring growth at last year’s pace, meaning the creation of 150,000 to 160,000 payroll jobs a month, according to Michael Gapen, senior United States economist and asset allocation strategist at Barclays.Without the tax increases, employers would probably be adding more than 200,000 jobs a month.Altogether, that means the economy will “create 600,000 fewer jobs in 2013 — leaving the unemployment rate 0.4 percentage point higher — than it would have if the 2012 tax policies had been kept in place,” said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Analytics.Congress’s tax deal will be felt most keenly in the beginning of the year, since workers around the country immediately have to start paying an additional 2 percent in taxes on their wages and salaries as a result of the end of the temporary payroll tax holiday.“That may surprise a lot of people as Christmas shopping bills come due and they find they have less in their paychecks,” said Mr. Feldman.Most analysts’ estimates for the fiscal bargain’s effects on the economy do not take into account remaining negotiations over major spending cuts and an increase in the debt ceiling. Congress seems unlikely to resolve either of these issues until March.“Only part of the poison pill that gave us the fiscal cliff has been addressed,” said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. “What Congress did in the last 48 hours is effectively strap on a bungee cord to the economy. That is, we fell off the cliff briefly on Jan. 1, then bounced back safely onto the cliff after both houses passed tax accord.”Congress decided to pause for two months on the $110 billion in mandated spending cuts set to take effect in 2013. These cuts would be evenly divided between defense and nondefense federal spending, and military contractors and other companies that rely heavily on federal money are expected to pull back some in the coming months, said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.It remains unclear how much of these cuts will materialize when Congress is done haggling. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats want them to take effect in full, a result that would shave around a half to a full percentage point off output growth this year.The across-the-board reductions may be swapped out at least in part for other, unknown kinds of spending cuts or tax increases, which has left some Americans concerned about whether they might be in the cross hairs themselves.Republicans have been pushing for a new formula that would curb Social Security benefits, for example.“Hopefully Congress has at least some compassion left buried in their minds and hearts and will step up to the plate and make sure our benefits aren’t cut,” said Terry Grigg, 63, of San Diego. His only income is about $12,000 from Social Security and disability benefits while he undergoes treatments for invasive skin cancer and a hernia. “That would really be a slap in the face to the common man, to seniors, to vets.”Medicare would be the primary target for cuts if Congress wanted to address the country’s long-term debt problems, many economists say. So far, though, most politicians have been reluctant to do so.“From a political standpoint we’ve got this tax deal done,” said Steve Blitz, director and chief economist at ITG Investment Research. “Then we need to get this debt ceiling and spending piece done. And I think if we can get the second piece done, however minimal it ends up being, that allows the process to begin a serious discussion on the obvious: medical costs.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/business/some-breaks-for-industries-are-retained-in-fiscal-deal.html,"Nearly $250 million for Hollywood. Over $330 million for the railroad industry. More than $220 million for rum producers. And $62 million for doing business in American Samoa.While taxes are expected to increase for most Americans as a result of the deal between the White House and Congress to end the fiscal impasse in Washington, corporate America was more fortunate. A bevy of tax breaks and credits that had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 will be extended for another year, costing taxpayers $46.1 billion over the next decade, according to Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation.The preservation of these subsidies and deductions has become a perennial Washington ritual in recent years, with lobbyists and companies and their allies on Capitol Hill securing their survival in the fine print of the tax code. Washington’s inability to close many of these loopholes is a sign of just how reluctant business is to sacrifice prized subsidies despite loud calls from many chief executives in recent months to raise taxes, cut spending and deal with huge budget deficits.“Except for the people who like it, it’s a giveaway,” said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. “It’s hard to mobilize opposition, but the people who benefit from it benefit a lot.”Many of the provisions survive because they are so obscure. A $62 million tax credit for employers in American Samoa benefits StarKist, which is the largest private employer in the South Pacific island chain, with nearly 2,000 workers there. The tax break was supported by Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who as former chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was an advocate for American territories that lack formal Senate representation.“We support the development credit, and it’s a key factor in our ability to maintain competitive operations in American Samoa,” said Mary Sestric, a spokeswoman for StarKist. “This is a big priority for us.”Corporations were keenly sensitive to changes in broader tax policy, in addition to benefiting from direct tax breaks. For example, Goldman Sachs distributed $65 million in stock to 10 senior executives in December instead of January, when the firm typically makes such awards. That move helped them avoid the higher tax rates that will now be imposed on income of $400,000 or more.The chief executive of Goldman, Lloyd C. Blankfein, was among the most prominent corporate executives who backed higher taxes as part of a broader deficit-reduction package. He and other business leaders also met with President Obama late last year as the White House sought support from corporate America during negotiations with Republicans in Congress.Some subsidies, like a break for research by companies, can actually have long-term benefits for the economy, defenders argue.Others, like the one that allows filmmakers to deduct the first $15 million in production expenses for movies made in the United States, are much more narrowly focused but have loyal supporters that manage to keep them alive year after year. Another beneficiary of Congressional largess is Nascar, which will enjoy a $78 million subsidy for racetrack construction over the next 10 years.“Once they get in, they tend to stay in,” said Alan Auerbach, director of the Robert D. Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California, Berkeley.Besides the $46.1 billion in corporate incentives over the next 10 years, there is another $18.1 billion in breaks for alternative energy, much of that going to companies as well. Producers of biodiesel, for example, will reap more than $2 billion in tax breaks. And while it may not exactly be an alternative source of energy, producers of coal on Indian lands retained $1 million in tax breaks — a provision backed by Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee.The wind industry, a chief beneficiary of support from Washington, will get $12 billion in subsidies over the next decade. In fact, the benefits that were included for the wind sector are slightly broader now than in previous years.Under the new rules, contained in the legislation that Mr. Obama signed on Wednesday, new wind farms will be covered by a production tax credit or an investment tax credit similar to the ones that just expired, but the projects will not need to be finished by the end of this year to qualify; they simply must have been started in 2013.The American Wind Energy Association, a trade group, said in an e-mail to its members that the change was made by Congress “specifically in order to accommodate the business timelines of our industry.” The business has been in a tax-driven boom-and-bust cycle.The renewal of the tax benefits was pushed strongly by Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Baucus and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. When the Senate began considering “tax extenders,” or continuations of various tax breaks, wind advocates pushed to have all of them included.“There always seemed to be some bipartisan support for this,” said Philip D. Tingle, a lawyer who specializes in energy taxes. “The element, the issue was, how they were going to pay for it.” The renewal will probably cost the Treasury about $12 billion, although the wind industry insists that it will generate so much taxable activity that total tax revenue, including those at the state and local level, will exceed the tax expenditure.The industry undertook a large lobbying campaign and says it generated more than 750,000 letters, e-mails and other communications with Congress. It took nearly 100 members of Congress on tours of wind farms and factories where components are built. The issue may be more regional than partisan; according to the American Wind Energy Association, 80 percent of wind farms are in Congressional districts represented by Republicans, as are 67 percent of the factories.The tax credits were also extended to cover electricity made from biomass, tides and ocean waves, landfill methane and improvements to hydroelectric stations."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/nyregion/chris-christie-rebukes-gop-for-inaction-on-hurricane-relief-bill.html,"This is the kind of moment that, in today’s hyper-choreographed political age, does not often happen: An ambitious governor angrily denounces his own political party before a national audience, accusing its leader of “duplicity,” “selfishness” and moral failure.Who else but Chris Christie?Governor Christie, a New Jersey Republican and possible presidential candidate with a reputation for take-no-prisoners bluster, attacked the House Republican leadership on Wednesday for its refusal to allow a vote on a Hurricane Sandy relief bill the night before.Mr. Christie said the Republicans had failed a “basic test of public service.”He said “palace intrigue” had resulted in New Jersey residents’ being used “as a pawn.”And he stated that the political machinations that doomed the bill were “why the American people hate Congress; it is why they hate them.”Setting aside the usual caution that lawmakers, mindful of relationships and protocol, bring to public appearances, Mr. Christie made unequivocally clear whom he held responsible.“There’s only one group to blame for the continued suffering of these innocent victims: the House majority and their speaker, John Boehner,” he said.He then reiterated that the decision to block the relief bill “was the speaker’s decision, his alone.”Those were unfettered fighting words, all the more potent emerging from the mouth of a governor who, just months ago, secured the coveted keynote spot at his party’s national convention, the traditional platform for its next anointed political star.But there may be some calculus behind Mr. Christie’s ire.The governor, who is believed to harbor presidential ambitions, has earned fans around the country with his regular-guy toughness. Some voters, disillusioned with both parties, are looking for a candidate who can claim a mantle of independence.And Mr. Christie was careful to praise the efforts of Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, another high-ranking Republican who is gaining in influence as Mr. Boehner struggles to control his caucus.The remarks were made at an uneasy time for Mr. Christie and his supporters in the Republican Party, who cultivated the governor as a rising star only to find themselves astonished and hurt by his warm embrace of President Obama in the aftermath of the hurricane, days before the November election.Some surrogates of the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney, later blamed Mr. Christie for helping to turn the campaign’s momentum against him.The governor has sought to mend those ties. It was unclear whether his words on Wednesday had strained them anew.Mr. Christie reserved particular disdain for Mr. Boehner, an Ohio Republican, saying that he had repeatedly assured him that a vote would be held on the bill and that he was offered “no credible explanation” as to why that did not happen.When he was informed, at 11:20 p.m. on Tuesday, that the bill had been scuttled, Mr. Christie said, he made four telephone calls trying to reach Mr. Boehner.“He did not take my calls,” the governor said.With that, Mr. Christie declared that he had lost trust in the most powerful elected Republican in the country.“There is no reason at the moment for me to believe anything they tell me, because they have been telling me stuff for weeks, and they didn’t deliver,” the governor said.He later added, “At the moment, I wouldn’t be looking to do much for House leadership.”The governor’s anger stood in contrast with the stoicism of another independent-minded politician. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told reporters at a more subdued appearance on Wednesday that he was confident an agreement on the relief bill would ultimately be reached.“It’s not for me to second-guess how you run a legislative body,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “I think we all know that both parties are fractured and are difficult to pull together and to lead.”It was a response that was typical of the mayor, a political independent who has shown contempt for the passions and gamesmanship that often slow down the political process.“His reaction was the same to all of these things: matter of fact,” recalled Howard Wolfson, a deputy mayor who worked with Mr. Bloomberg to lobby Congress on the bill.“It was businesslike,” he said. “It was, ‘O.K., what’s the next step?’ ”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/business/economy/manufacturing-increased-slightly-in-december.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — American manufacturing grew slightly last month and factory hiring increased. The modest gains suggested that the economy entered the new year with some momentum.The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group for purchasing managers, said on Wednesday that its index of manufacturing activity rose in December to 50.7. That is up from a reading of 49.5 in November, which was the lowest reading since July 2009, one month after the recession ended.A reading above 50 indicates growth, while a reading below signals contraction.A measure of employment increased last month to 52.7. That is up from 48.4 in November, which was the first time the employment gauge fell below 50 in three years.Factories have cut jobs in three of the four months through November, according to government data. The increase in employment in the I.S.M. survey suggests manufacturers may have stepped up hiring last month.The Labor Department is scheduled to report on December employment on Friday.A gauge of new orders was unchanged and production grew more slowly, the survey found. Manufacturers also cut back on stockpiles, a sign of concern about future demand.The closely watched manufacturing survey was completed before Congress reached a deal to avoid the impending expiration of Bush era tax cuts.The last-minute deal passed Tuesday averts widespread tax increases and delays deep spending cuts that had threatened to push the country back into recession. But most Americans will see some increase in taxes this year, which will most likely slow consumer spending.A gauge of export orders rose above 50 for the first time in six months, according to the I.S.M. survey. That is a hopeful sign that overseas economies are improving, raising demand for American goods.A survey in China on Monday found manufacturing activity in that country expanded for the third consecutive month. That adds to evidence that its economy is improving after a slowdown last year.Growth in the American economy is being driven by other sectors, like housing. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that construction companies spent more on home building in November, rising 0.4 percent for its eighth monthly increase.Overall construction spending, however, slipped 0.3 percent because of a 5.5 percent drop in spending on federal government projects. Spending on commercial buildings, like office buildings and shopping malls, also fell. This was the first decline in overall construction spending since March and followed a 0.7 percent increase in October, which was revised lower.There have been some positive signs for factory production. In November, companies substantially increased their orders for a category of large equipment that reflects their investment plans. That followed a big increase in the same category in October."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/us/politics/for-obama-fiscal-deal-is-a-victory-that-also-holds-risks.html,"WASHINGTON —  The deal significantly raises taxes on the rich, with no expiration date. It extends tax credits for the poor and the middle class. It provides more jobless benefits. Largely overlooked, it extends an alternative-energy tax credit that has helped create a clean-energy boom.And it includes almost no spending cuts.For President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress, the fiscal deal reached this week is full of small victories that further their largest policy aims. Above all, it takes another step toward Mr. Obama’s goal of orienting federal policy more toward the middle class and the poor, at the expense of the rich.Yet the deal, which the Senate and the House have passed and Mr. Obama has signed, also represents a substantial risk for the president.Throughout the negotiations of the last two months, Mr. Obama pushed for a larger agreement, one that would have canceled other looming budget deadlines, starting with one on the debt ceiling. He and his aides saw the so-called fiscal cliff, with its trillions of dollars in scheduled tax increases that Republicans abhorred, as leverage to start fresh in a second term and avoid more deadline-driven partisan fights.“I want a big deal. I want a comprehensive deal,” Mr. Obama said almost two months ago, at his first post-election news conference. “I want to see if we can, you know, at least for the foreseeable future provide certainty to businesses and the American people.”When House Republicans made it clear that they opposed a big deal, however, Mr. Obama decided to take the smaller deal, bank a series of victories and wait to fight another day. The alternative — debated inside the White House, but not ultimately a close call — would have been to go over the cliff in the hope of forcing Republicans into a larger deal.Without that larger agreement, Mr. Obama will be left to find solutions to future budget deadlines without the leverage that came with the prospect of automatic tax increases.“The best world would have been a bigger agreement,” an administration official acknowledged. “This is a big win in a second-best world.”Perhaps the best prism through which to see the Democrats’ gains is inequality. In the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama said that his top priority as president would be to “create bottom-up economic growth” and reduce inequality.He has governed as such. In the 2009 stimulus, he insisted on making tax credits “fully refundable,” so that even people who did not make enough to pay much federal tax would benefit. The 2010 health care law overhaul was probably the biggest attack on inequality since it began rising in the 1970s, increasing taxes on businesses and the rich to pay for health insurance largely for the middle class.As part of this week’s deal, Mr. Obama did make several major compromises. He accepted much less in overall tax revenue than the government would have received absent any deal. He allowed a payroll-tax cut, which applied to most households, to expire. And he yielded both on aspects of the estate tax and on the level at which the top marginal income-tax rate would start, moving it to $450,000 for couples, from $250,000.Still, using inequality as a yardstick, he won much of what he had wanted. By holding firm to a top rate of 39.6 percent — up from 35 percent — he locked in a substantial tax increase for the very richest, who have received the biggest pretax raises in recent years.On average, the top 0.1 percent of earners — whose incomes start at $2.7 million and go much higher — will pay $444,000 more in taxes in 2013 than they otherwise would have, according to the Tax Policy Center. The increases stem from both the fiscal deal and the new taxes in the health care law.In effect, the deal preserves the “compassionate conservative” part of President George W. Bush’s tax agenda — reducing federal income taxes on the working poor, sometimes to zero — while limiting the parts that most helped the affluent.Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts, R. Glenn Hubbard, now dean of Columbia Business School, did not celebrate the enshrinement of most of them. He said in an interview that the deal would amplify the tax code’s distortions on the economy.Former President Bill Clinton, by contrast, has told people that he considers the deal a good one, according to two people who have spoken to him.Beyond income tax code, the deal continued jobless benefits for two million long-term unemployed who otherwise would have lost them immediately. And it extended, for one year, an energy tax credit that has reduced alternative-energy costs and increased use.The question that hangs over the deal for Democrats is whether they will have to play defense on the budget for the rest of Mr. Obama’s presidency.When Republicans stepped back from a larger deal last month, one that would have resolved the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama faced a choice. He could have worked toward a smaller deal, as he did, or insisted that the debt ceiling had to be part of any package.White House officials took the path they did because they feared that a hardened stance on the debt ceiling would result in no deal at all: taxes would have risen on nearly everyone; automatic spending cuts would have begun; jobless benefits would have ended for many; and markets may have reacted badly.In the chaos that could have followed, the officials believed, a grand bargain would have been unlikely. If anything, Democrats — worried they would be blamed for the economy’s troubles, as the party holding the White House — might have struggled to get a deal as good as this week’s. Having won this round, Democrats still have compromises to offer Republicans in the next one, like changes to Social Security.But some of Mr. Obama’s allies wonder if he should have taken the risk of a confrontation now. A stalemate next time will bring no threat of higher taxes, and Republicans may stand firmer, demanding cuts that undo Mr. Obama’s recent gains.“I now fear that we are heading toward a crisis that can dwarf what we’ve just been through,” said Robert Greenstein, president of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. “We really won’t know how best to view the deal, and how well the White House has done, until the debt limit is done.”The wait for a fuller answer will not last too long: The federal government is on pace to need a higher debt limit by March."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/us/politics/debt-deal-fails-to-allay-fears-on-us-global-power.html,"WASHINGTON — Two years ago the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, declared that “the most significant threat to our national security is our debt.” After a decade in which the nation had chased Al Qaeda and invaded Iraq, Admiral Mullen was saying, in essence, that the biggest enemy was us.Now that Congress and President Obama have slipped past the latest budget deadline with a bill that does little to address the country’s long-term debt issues — and by some measures might worsen them — the worries of the national security establishment have been reignited. Most pointedly, military and diplomatic experts wonder whether the United States is at risk of squandering its global influence.“There’s a sense that we’ve been playing roulette with our position, and this deal does nothing to stop that,” Richard N. Haass, the president of Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview. His coming book, “Foreign Policy Begins at Home,” is part of a wave of recent literature arguing that America’s reduced global ambitions are linked to its status as a debtor nation.Vali Nasr, who will soon publish “The Dispensable Nation,” argues that the debt, among other economic woes, has allowed Mr. Obama and other Democrats to justify a retreat from global engagement. “It’s made it far easier to say ‘We can’t do more,’ ” said Mr. Nasr, the dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. “And without addressing the debt issues, it will be easier to make that argument for years to come.”A departing senior diplomat at the State Department who requested anonymity, ruminating on the outcome of the confrontation on the fiscal crisis, said that the failure to attack the long-term debt issues would become another reason “to turn our backs on the Middle East and trim our sails on the new focus on Asia.”That is the theme that the Chinese — who have an interest in portraying the United States as a declining power unable to manage its economy — are already promoting. “The politicians have chosen to kick the can down the road,” the state-run Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Wednesday. “The can will never disappear,” it continued, warning that the United States was falling “into an abyss you can never come out of.”Most evidence suggests that the country’s debt is not an immediate crisis. The deficit is expected to shrink somewhat in coming years, and even after the United States lost its AAA bond rating, foreigners have remained willing to lend the country money at very low interest rates. That is a sign of confidence in the American economy and a recognition that Europe and Asia have problems of their own.But the aging of the population and the growth of health costs will most likely cause the deficit to grow rapidly in coming decades, meaning that the most difficult choices about taxes and spending are still ahead. Absent decisions on those issues, the government will have fewer resources and be more dependent on foreign lenders — increasingly the Chinese.“Partly it is about resources,” Mr. Haass said, referring to the national security implications of the deficit. “But it is also about reducing your vulnerability to the machinations of currency markets and potentially hostile central bankers” who choose whether to buy American debt.“When we appear to be dysfunctional, as we have in recent times, it makes it hard to be the model for the democratic, capitalistic model we say we want to be in the world,” he added.History suggests that the relationship between debt and American power is a complex one, subject to differing interpretations by both economists and historians. The federal debt exceeded 100 percent of the gross domestic product at the end of World War II, but the postwar period nonetheless marked the beginning of America’s superpower status. The debt fell fairly steadily during the cold war, and it was cut to about a third of gross domestic product by the end of the Nixon administration — even as the country retreated into a post-Vietnam War funk.On the flip side, the era now regarded as America’s “unipower moment” — the Clinton years of the mid-1990s — was also a time when the government was significantly reducing debt.But historians point out that other factors besides debt have often driven the perception of American power. The growth of the American manufacturing behemoth in the ’50s and ’60s helped drive the nation’s rise. So much seemed at stake in the cold war that most Western countries waited for Washington to act first, regardless of its postwar deficit. In the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States as the only player with global reach — and made it easier to cut defense budgets, suggesting that power drove deficits more than the reverse.Today, the United States lacks many of those earlier advantages. With economic growth harder to come by, the only obvious way to make major cuts in the budget is to go after Social Security, Medicare and the $1 trillion national security budget — which includes the military, intelligence, diplomacy and development. And whenever the United States decides not to engage in some part of the world, countries look to a new source of investment and aid: China.That is certainly happening in countries that are waiting for the promised “Arab Spring fund” to aid emerging democracies.“Morsi has played this very smart, asking the Chinese whether they are willing to invest in Egypt the way they have in Kenya or Uganda,” Mr. Nasr said, referring to Egypt’s president, Mohamed Morsi.“What’s happened is that we’ve been able to hide behind the economic argument to justify why we are no longer the venture capitalist of democracy,” added Mr. Nasr, who worked for Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan early in the Obama administration who died in 2010.When Mr. Obama came to office, no one made the argument about focusing on the domestic sources of American power more than the new president. He used that as an argument for ending America’s military presence in Iraq and moving to the exits in Afghanistan. “Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power,” Mr. Obama said in 2009. “It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy.”In the presidential campaign last year, he pushed back at arguments about long-term American decline. Since his re-election, his aides have as well, arguing that the restoration of growth, though slow, and exploitation of new sources of American oil and gas have set the stage for a revival over the next four years."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/science/communications-satellites-banned-as-weapons-now-legal-for-export.html,"To the delight of American satellite makers, communications satellites — which orbit Earth to relay phone calls, link ships to shore and broadcast television programs — will become legal for civilian export under legislation that President Obama signed into law on Thursday.Although the United States founded the industry, manufacturers were forced to pull back from international markets after a 1999 law categorized the satellites as weapons and restricted their export. At the time, Congress was fearful that selling satellites abroad could allow technology secrets to fall into the wrong hands.The defense bill that President Obama signed will undo that step and let American companies sell communications satellites as civilian technology rather than as deadly arms. Among the beneficiaries will be companies like Boeing, Hughes and Space Systems/Loral.“This is a tremendous assist for an industry that is inherently international,” said Patricia A. Cooper, president of the Satellite Industry Association, a business group in Washington. “It will ensure our place at the forefront of space.”As a practical matter, communications satellites made their debut in 1964 and quickly became stars of the space age. The first craft, orbiting at 22,300 miles, relayed signals to the United States from Japan that let American television viewers watch live coverage of the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo.But the industry stumbled 13 years ago after Republicans in Congress pressed for a law that restricted communications satellite exports. The lawmakers praised it as a security precaution that would prevent China and other perceived foes from stealing technology secrets. Detractors saw it as a cynical ploy meant to discredit the Clinton administration and its policy of Chinese engagement.That law put communications satellites on Washington’s list of export-controlled munitions: tools of war like tanks, bombs, missiles and equipment for making nuclear arms. Foreign companies took the opportunity to increase their satellite sales.The new law gives Mr. Obama the authority to return communications satellites to their previous status as civilian technology. It retains provisions that restrict the export of satellites to nations like China and North Korea, and to sponsors of state terrorism like Iran.Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, who introduced a bill to change the policy on satellite exports and whose state is a space industry hub, said the measure offered satellite manufacturers a crucial lift.“Companies across the country have been operating at a disadvantage due to these policies,” he said in a statement. “These reforms will give our businesses a chance to compete globally while still protecting our national security interests.”The strict export controls arose from a political fight over satellite launchings by China, which in the 1980s began offering cheap rides into orbit on low-cost rockets. Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush, both Republicans, approved transfers of American spacecraft to Chinese rockets, as did President Bill Clinton, a Democrat.Starting in early 1998, a series of upsets brought the expanding trade to a halt. Two American satellite makers involved in the Chinese launchings, Hughes and Loral, were accused of giving China advice about making not only commercial rockets, but also military missiles.Republicans, who controlled Congress at the time, argued that satellite exports could lead to a hemorrhage of secret materials and information, and said that China might already have stolen encryption secrets.After the strict export rules took effect in 1999, the legal complications involved in selling communications satellites and components abroad contributed to a sharp decline in the American share of the market, from a dominating position to about 50 percent today.During the 2008 presidential campaign, Mr. Obama said the rules had “unduly hampered the competitiveness of the domestic aerospace industry” and vowed to push for change.Representative Howard L. Berman, Democrat of California, who for a decade helped lead the movement for change, said its culmination as law would help restore the nation’s competitiveness in the global satellite market.“Treating commercial satellites and components as if they were lethal weapons, regardless of whether they’re going to friend or foe, has gravely harmed U.S. space manufacturers,” he said.Mr. Berman added that the benefits extended beyond the manufacturers. The national security establishment relies on the companies and their technological skills to fulfill the government’s satellite needs and to develop spacecraft involved in a wide range of military missions.“If they can’t compete in the international marketplace,” he said of the companies, “they can’t innovate and cannot survive.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/technology/googles-lawyers-work-behind-the-scenes-to-carry-the-day.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — For 19 months, Google pressed its case with antitrust regulators investigating the company. Working relentlessly behind the scenes, executives made frequent flights to Washington, laying out their legal arguments and shrewdly applying lessons learned from Microsoft’s bruising antitrust battle in the 1990s.After regulators had pored over nine million documents, listened to complaints from disgruntled competitors and took sworn testimony from Google executives, the government concluded that the law was on Google’s side. At the end of the day, they said, consumers had been largely unharmed.That is why one of the biggest antitrust investigations of an American company in years ended with a slap on the wrist Thursday, when the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of Google’s search practices without bringing a complaint. Google voluntarily made two minor concessions.“The way they managed to escape it is through a barrage of not only political officials but also academics aligned against doing very much in this particular case,” said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of antitrust law at the University of Iowa who has worked as a paid adviser to Google in the past. “The first sign of a bad antitrust case is lack of consumer harm, and there just was not any consumer harm emerging in this very long investigation.”The F.T.C. had put serious effort into its investigation of Google. Jon Leibowitz, the agency’s chairman, has long advocated for the commission to flex its muscle as an enforcer of antitrust laws, and the commission had hired high-powered consultants, including Beth A. Wilkinson, an experienced litigator, and Richard J. Gilbert, a well-known economist.Still, Mr. Leibowitz said during a news conference announcing the result of the inquiry, the evidence showed that Google “doesn’t violate American antitrust laws.”“The conclusion is clear: Google’s services are good for users and good for competition,” David Drummond, Google’s chief legal officer, wrote in a company blog post.The main thrust of the investigation was into how Google’s search results had changed since it expanded into new search verticals, like local business listings and comparison shopping. A search for pizza or jeans, for instance, now shows results with photos and maps from Google’s own local business service and its shopping product more prominently than links to other Web sites, which has enraged competing sites.But while the F.T.C. said that Google’s actions might have hurt individual competitors, over all it found that the search engine helped consumers, as evidenced by Google users’ clicking on the products that Google highlighted and competing search engines’ adopting similar approaches.Google outlined these kinds of arguments to regulators in many meetings over the last two years, as it has intensified its courtship of Washington, with Google executives at the highest levels, as well as lawyers, lobbyists and engineers appearing in the capital.One of the arguments they made, according to people briefed on the discussions, was that technology is such a fast-moving industry that regulatory burdens would hinder its evolution. Google makes about 500 changes to its search algorithm each year, so results look different now than they did even six months ago.The definition of competition in the tech industry is also different and constantly changing, Google argued.For instance, just recently Amazon and Apple, which used to be in different businesses than Google, have become its competitors. Google’s share of the search market has stayed at about two-thirds even though competing search engines are “just a click away,” as the company repeatedly argued. That would become the company’s mantra to demonstrate that it was not abusing its market power.To underline these arguments, Google spent $13.1 million on lobbying in the first three quarters in 2012, up from $5.9 million in the same period in 2011. And Google’s lobbyist in chief, Eric E. Schmidt, the company’s executive chairman and former chief executive, has made himself a Washington insider as a close adviser to President Obama.Then there were the lessons of the Microsoft case.“Google had the Microsoft case as a template,” said Kevin Werbach, an associate professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. “Google just had to convince the regulators it was sufficiently different from Microsoft.”One lesson for Google executives was to play nicely with the regulators. Microsoft’s executives were known for their uncooperative demeanors during their tangle with the government. But even Mr. Schmidt, known for speaking candidly, was on his best behavior.Google, and its lawyers and hired experts, also argued forcefully that this case was different than the one against Microsoft. For one, they pointed out again, the technology world is so different. At the time of the Microsoft inquiry, its software was the main on-ramp to the Internet.“Search today is not a bottleneck monopoly for anything,” said Tim Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford who studies competition in computing and has worked as a paid expert for Google recently and for Microsoft in the past.“That’s not the same as everyone who wants to do mass market computing has to go through Google, like back then everyone who wanted to do mass market computing had to go through Microsoft,” he added.Microsoft, leading a chorus of unsatisfied Google competitors, said Thursday that it was disappointed in the F.T.C.’s decision.In a blog post published Thursday night, Dave Heiner, a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel, called the decision a “missed opportunity.” “The F.T.C.’s overall resolution of this matter is weak and — frankly — unusual,” Mr. Heiner wrote. “We are concerned that the F.T.C. may not have obtained adequate relief even on the few subjects that Google has agreed to address.”Mr. Heiner added that Microsoft remained hopeful that other antitrust agencies, including those in Europe, would take more forceful action against Google.Harsh criticism of the decision also came from Gary Reback, an experienced Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who represents a collection of Internet companies that complained to the F.T.C. about Google’s behavior.“I’ve been doing this almost 40 years, been involved in scores of antitrust investigations,” he said. “I’ve never seen anything so incomplete and lacking and even incompetent as what happened here.”Richard Feinstein, director of the F.T.C.’s bureau of competition, dismissed Mr. Reback’s comment as “silly.”“This was a very thorough, very professional investigation performed by very diligent and dedicated staff,” he said.Regulators had anticipated criticism from Google’s rivals and tried to answer the complaints in their news conference.“Some believe the commission should have done more in this case, perhaps because they are locked in a hand in hand combat with Google around the world,” Mr. Liebowitz said. But, he said, “We really do follow the facts where they lead.” He added, “The focus of our law is on protecting competition, not competitors.”Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia who was a senior adviser to the F.T.C. until last summer, said the outcome of the Google case reflected a change in thinking about antitrust enforcement. “It used to be like the way we dealt with the mob,” said Mr. Wu, who was involved in the agency’s Google inquiry but who emphasized that he was not speaking for the F.T.C.“I don’t believe it’s the position of antitrust agencies to invent competition where there isn’t any,” he said. “People like Google better than Bing. Microsoft is trying to do everything it can to change that, but people still seem to prefer Google.”Still, some veterans of the technology industry said that even though the agency did not find an antitrust violation, it still was sending a message to Google that it was not off the hook for good.“There’s a long track record of government never really going away,” said David Farber, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a former chief technology for the Federal Communications Commission who testified as a government witness in the Microsoft case. “They will come back.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/car-sales-end-strong-year-on-modest-note.html,"DETROIT — Automakers on Thursday reported their strongest sales year since 2007, posting solid December results in the United States and promising more growth in 2013.Sales of new cars and trucks increased 9 percent in December, a gain that put total sales for 2012 at about 14.5 million vehicles — the industry’s best performance in five years, according to the research firm Autodata.That represents a 13 percent increase over 2011, and raises expectations that demand will continue to rise as more Americans need to replace their aging vehicles with new models.Auto executives forecast that the United States market would grow to at least 15.5 million this year and possibly higher, if housing starts and other economic factors continue to improve.“For the industry, 2012 was mission accomplished,” said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the auto research site TrueCar.com. “Companies are hitting their sales goals, and they are doing it with fewer incentives.”Much of the growth has been concentrated in the comebacks of Toyota and Honda from supply chain disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan two years ago. And while automakers like Chrysler and Volkswagen posted hefty increases throughout the year, the two biggest American companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, lagged the overall gains.December was a microcosm of the year’s results, as G.M. and Ford on Thursday reported smaller sales increases than those of their chief domestic, European and Asian rivals. G.M. said sales in December increased 4.9 percent, compared with the same month a year ago, primarily because of new products like the Cadillac ATS sedan and higher incentives on its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.The company had been losing ground in the high-profit pickup segment until it added discounts to the Silverado, which posted a 6.1 percent sales increase in December, and the Sierra, which was up 13.4 percent. For the year, G.M. sold 2.59 million vehicles, an increase of 3.7 percent from 2011.G.M.’s head of United States sales, Kurt McNeil, said the company expected significant growth to about 15.5 million vehicles industrywide this year. He noted that Tuesday’s pact on the fiscal crisis in Washington removed potential concerns for consumers shopping for new vehicles.“We are especially pleased that the politicians on both sides of the aisle in Washington were able to compromise,” Mr. McNeil said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday. “The short-term crisis has passed.”Ford reported a slight sales increase of 1.6 percent in December, as safety recalls for its new Escape S.U.V. and Fusion sedan depressed its overall results. Ford said that sales of the Fusion dropped 10.8 percent during the month, and Escape sales slid 21.3 percent. The company has been plagued with multiple recalls on engines and other parts on the new vehicles, which are usually among its strongest sellers.The drop-off was mitigated by strong results for Ford’s two smallest cars, the Focus, which increased in sales by 58.3 percent, and the Fiesta, which was up by 52.8 percent.For all of 2012, Ford’s United States sales increased 4.7 percent, to 2.24 million vehicles. Ken Czubay, head of Ford’s United States sales and marketing, said the company’s small-car sales were its best in more than a decade.Ford predicted that industry sales could possibly reach 16 million vehicles in 2013, as more consumers trade in older models and buy new, more fuel-efficient ones. That peak hasn’t been reached since sales of 16.1 million in 2007.Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit companies, was the star performer in December, with a 10.4 percent increase.The company’s new compact car, the Dodge Dart, gained traction with sales of 6,100 — its highest monthly total since it was introduced last summer. Much of Chrysler’s lineup — ranging from Jeep S.U.V.’s to the tiny Fiat 500 — posted sales records for the month of December. For the year, Chrysler said it sold 1.65 million vehicles, a 20.6 percent increase from 2011.Toyota reported a 9 percent sales gain in December, which was one of the weaker months in its turnaround in 2012. The company said it sold 2.08 million vehicles in the United States for the full year, which was a 26.6 percent gain over 2011. Its three top-selling vehicles — the Corolla compact car, Camry sedan and Prius gas-electric hybrid — accounted for nearly half of its overall sales for the year.Analysts said Toyota appeared poised to outperform the overall market this year as well.“Fresh products like the all-new RAV4 S.U.V. should help keep the momentum going,” said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com.Honda ended the year on a high note, reporting a 26.2 percent jump in sales in December in the United States. Its bellwether cars, the Accord and Civic, led the way, each with increases of more than 60 percent. For the year, Honda said it sold 1.14 million vehicles, a 24 percent gain from 2011.Other automakers had mixed results. Nissan said its December sales dropped 1.6 percent, but the company ended 2012 with a 9.5 percent gain for the year.Volkswagen closed the year with another banner month. The German automaker reported a 29.9 percent gain for December and a 30.6 percent increase for the full year."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/energy-environment/congress-extends-incentives-for-biodiesel-industry.html,"The Congressional budget deal brokered this week kept tax breaks in place for a variety of industries, but biodiesel got something even better: a retroactive reinstatement of a dollar-a-gallon credit going back to January 2012, when it lapsed.The retroactive portion of the credit, which will run through the end of 2013, represents a benefit to the blenders of about $1 billion. And the $1 per gallon of biodiesel amounts to roughly one-quarter of the fuel’s current wholesale price.With the credit in place, production will be about 1.6 billion gallons this year, estimated Ben Evans, a spokesman for the National Biodiesel Board, a trade association. Without the credit, the industry would have sold only 1.3 billion gallons, he said.Since a retroactive credit cannot influence behavior, its main effect will be to encourage blenders that produced biodiesel last year to invest more in infrastructure, Mr. Evans said. Had it been in place a year ago, he said, about 300 million more gallons would have been produced.Any increase in biodiesel production typically draws criticism from environmentalists and others who warn that it will cut into food production. Soybeans make up about 50 percent of the mix, with the rest coming from animal fats, cooking grease and other sources.The fuel itself is usually sold in a blend of 5 to 20 percent biodiesel, with the remainder consisting of petroleum diesel.A year after Congress eliminated two major subsidies for corn-based ethanol, the market has still not absorbed all the ethanol available. So the budget deal also extends tax credits to help gas stations invest in selling a blend of 85 percent ethanol, or E85, or less.The package allows a credit of up to $100,000 per filling station. The problem is that there were few takers for a similar credit that was in place last year.Only 3,000 of the 165,000 gas stations in the United States are equipped to sell ethanol blends higher than 10 percent. And at current prices, the millions of cars now capable of using E85 can cover more miles on E10, a blend that is 10 percent ethanol, for the same price.With the price of a gallon of ethanol now below the price of a gallon of conventional gasoline, oil companies have incentives to use the material as a fuel supplement regardless of tax policy. And the industry still benefits from a quota that the federal government imposes on the oil industry to use ethanol and other bio-based fuels.But the incentive for consumers remains weak because a gallon of ethanol has only about two-thirds as much energy as a gallon of conventional gasoline.For years, experts said that introducing new fuels created a chicken-and-egg problem; nobody would sell the fuel until plenty of vehicles could use it, and nobody would buy the vehicles until filling stations sold it. Yet now there are vehicles and fuel, but few gas stations.Bob Dinneen, president of the Renewable Fuels Association, said the chicken-and-egg analogy was no longer appropriate. “Maybe we get the egg but not the yolk,” he joked. “We do have the fuel, and the vehicles — we don’t have access to the pump.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/nyregion/houses-of-worship-seeking-fema-grants-face-constitutional-barrier.html,"Hurricane Sandy flooded and battered St. George Malankara Orthodox Church of India in New Dorp, Staten Island, ruining its basement, windows and doors. Yet, when its vicar contacted the Federal Emergency Management Agency to ask for a grant to help with the estimated $150,000 rebuilding cost, he said he got a clear answer: No.“FEMA said that they considered the church a business, so they offered us a loan,” the Rev. Alex K. Joy said in an interview about a month after the storm. “But we don’t want a loan. We have 400 members, 90 families. In this situation, we need some assistance.”A broad range of private nonprofit organizations qualify for federal disaster assistance grants, including zoos, museums, performing arts centers and libraries. Houses of worship, however, are not on the list, even though in recent years the federal government has ruled that some religiously affiliated institutions like schools and hospitals can get grants.An effort is under way to change that, led by several Jewish organizations, including the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America and the American Jewish Committee. Last month, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, introduced an amendment to the multibillion-dollar Hurricane Sandy recovery appropriations bill that would explicitly place houses of worship on the list of qualified organizations. But because of an unrelated bipartisan deal meant to ease the bill’s passage, that amendment was locked out of consideration.Mr. Lieberman’s tenure in the Senate ended this week, but Nathan Diament, the executive director of public policy for the Institute for Public Affairs at the Orthodox Union, said he was continuing to work with other lawmakers to add the amendment to the bill before it came again before Congress.“Houses of worship should not be discriminated against and excluded from getting assistance on the same terms as other eligible nonprofits,” he said.Mr. Diament has also been meeting with officials from the Homeland Security Department and other federal agencies to see if the change can be made without legislative action. FEMA regulations are silent on the matter of houses of worship, so a bureaucratic decision may be all that is required, he added.Yet the issue is controversial, because the constitutional separation of church and state generally bans the use of tax money to build religious institutions. Dena Sher, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, said the organization had “serious concerns” about the effort to change the policy and was monitoring the situation.“To rebuild houses of worship is a form of compelled support for religion, which is exactly what the First Amendment is designed to protect against,” Ms. Sher said. “We understand and identify with the serious difficulties everyone is facing, but we can’t let this misfortune be used as a premise to erode these bedrock principles.”Barry W. Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said, “I think that challenges would be inevitable if you started to reconstruct religious buildings with federal or state tax dollars.”Marc D. Stern, the general counsel of the American Jewish Committee, disagrees. In a letter to senators last week, he argued that aid “distributed under a neutral program of storm relief” could be made available constitutionally in part because “there is a strong societal interest in aid to all who have suffered damage.”Though the outcome is uncertain, UJA-Federation of New York and several other Jewish organizations have been urging damaged synagogues to apply for FEMA rebuilding grants before coming deadlines, in case the rule changes. There appears to be less of an organized push by institutions affiliated with other religions, though the United States Council of Catholic Bishops is also supportive of the change, a representative said. The new financing rules, if they are put in place, would apply to all houses of worship, regardless of religion.In New York, about 40 damaged synagogues will most likely apply for grants; in New Jersey, about a dozen, Mr. Diament said.There is no clear count of churches. Some of the most damaged, like the Episcopal churches along the New Jersey barrier islands, carry comprehensive insurance and may not need the extra help, said Cynthia McFarland, a spokeswoman for the Episcopal Diocese of New Jersey.Dennis Bellars, the senior warden of St. Elisabeth’s Chapel-by-the-Sea in Ortley Beach, N.J., said, “We have 100 percent replacement value through the church’s insurance.” The chapel was washed away in the storm, and when Mr. Bellars called FEMA, he said, he was told that the owner of the church, the local diocese, would have to submit the application.The ban on FEMA grants for houses of worship is not total: churches and synagogues may apply for reimbursement for social services they provided, including homeless shelters, preschools or feeding programs. Houses of worship can also qualify for low-interest Small Business Administration loans.Some of the clergy members applying for disaster grants said they understood the complexity of the issue, and were not counting on the money.Father Joy, of St. George Malankara, who said he spoke with President Obama about the issue during his visit to Staten Island in November, said Friday that his church reopened for Christmas with the help of private donations alone. (The church did not have insurance to cover the damage.) And Rabbi David S. Bauman of Temple Israel of Long Beach, N.Y., who said he spoke with the president about FEMA financing at the White House Hanukkah party in December, said he was reaching out to as many donors as he could for help with his temple’s $5 million in damage.“I’m frustrated,” Rabbi Bauman said, “but I don’t have harsh feelings toward the policy, because I understand it.”Rabbi Marjorie Slome of the West End Temple in the Rockaways section of Queens, which also suffered extensive storm damage, said she planned to submit her grant application on Dec. 31, with the help of the Jewish Community Relations Council of New York. Private donations and insurance payments had so far come up short, she said.“I’m hopeful that the government will understand it’s a one-time thing, that our goal is not to blur the separation of church and state,” Rabbi Slome said. “I understand that it is a tenuous line to walk, but our synagogue is really going to need help in being able to open its doors again.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/economy/at-meeting-debate-over-length-of-fed-program.html,"WASHINGTON — Just a few months after announcing a campaign to reduce unemployment, Federal Reserve officials are already debating how soon to stop it, reflecting persistent internal divisions about the effort’s value.At a meeting in December, several members of the Fed’s policy making committee argued that purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities should be reduced or ended “well before the end of 2013,” according to an account of the meeting the Fed published Thursday after a customary three-week delay.The Fed announced after the meeting that it would keep buying assets until the pace of job creation improved substantially, part of an effort to increase the impact of its policies by announcing economic objectives rather than end dates. But the account shows that many members of the 12-person committee continue to think in terms of end dates, partly because they are worried about the potential costs.The concerns include the potential disruption of financial markets and the delicate balance between encouraging private borrowing and unleashing speculation. Fed officials professed less concern that the purchases could loosen the Fed’s grip on inflation. They noted that inflation remained low, and that they expected it to stay under control.“While almost all members thought that the asset purchase program begun in September had been effective and supportive of growth, they also generally saw that the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased,” the meeting account said.The stock market declined after the Fed released the account of its deliberations, suggesting some investors were surprised by the cautious tone, but the drop was modest. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index lost 0.21 percent of its value at the close of trading.Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said investors had expected the Fed to keep buying “through much, if not all, of this year.” He said investors would now need to watch more closely for evidence that the recovery was gaining strength, which could lead the Fed to curtail its purchases.“This should significantly amplify the financial market’s sensitivity to upcoming economic data,” Mr. LaVorgna wrote in a note to clients Thursday.The government will release its monthly jobs report Friday morning.But Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said investors should keep the account in perspective, as a reflection of modest misgivings in the middle of the most aggressive effort the Fed has ever undertaken to stimulate the economy.The central bank announced after the December meeting that it planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent, provided inflation remained under control, and it estimated that the rate would cross that threshold no sooner than mid-2015.The Fed also plans to maintain for the foreseeable future the vast portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities it has acquired since 2008 to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.And Ms. Swonk said she saw nothing in the account to alter her conviction that the Fed intended to keep adding to that stockpile through the coming year. She said the reservations of some officials had not prevented the new campaign, and would not force an early conclusion, because the basic argument for the purchases remained compelling: the economy is not growing fast enough, too many people remain unemployed, and the rest of government is not helping.“I think that they would love to be able to stop,” Ms. Swonk said, but given the condition of the economy, “I think there’s still a huge bias toward buying.”She said that four of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee would be replaced in January, and that two new arrivals — Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston — had been outspoken supporters of asset purchases.The Fed’s current program of asset purchases began in September with the announcement that it would buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month until the outlook for the labor market “improved substantially.”In December, the Fed said it would also expand its holdings of Treasuries by $45 billion each month, replacing a program in which it acquired that amount of long-term Treasuries each month by selling the same amount of short-term Treasuries, so that the total size of its portfolio remained unchanged.The account said that a few officials predicted the purchases would need to continue through the end of the year, and a few said it was too soon to make a judgment.“Several others thought that it would probably be appropriate to slow or to stop purchases well before the end of 2013, citing concerns about financial stability or the size of the balance sheet,” the account continued, before concluding, “One member viewed any additional purchases as unwarranted.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/lessons-from-european-brinkmanship.html,"Will the United States follow the European path in 2013?Let’s hope so.A year ago, the world’s markets were watching Europe with rising fear. Some expected 2012 to be the year that the euro zone broke up. Germany did not want to pay to bail out its less fortunate neighbors unless they agreed to severe austerity and to what amounted to a surrender of sovereignty — ideas that other countries were loath to accept.What ensued during the year was a series of summit meetings that often seemed to do more for the hotel business in assorted European capitals than they did to solve the problem. Agreements in principle were announced, sending markets up, only to stumble back when the details got difficult.What the naysayers missed was that there really was a common commitment to save the euro, and that in the end politicians and central bankers would do what was needed to avert disaster. Finally, in July, the European Central Bank came up with a plan that assured the euro area banks, and the troubled governments, that they would have access to money at reasonable rates. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, went along, angering some of her German colleagues, who thought she was straying from basic principles.So it could be in the United States Congress. The outgoing Congress went up to the final minutes, amid much angst, before it averted the fiscal crisis. There are reasons to grumble about the details, and more deadlines loom in the new Congress, but the essential point was that in the end the House Republicans allowed a bill to pass even though a majority of them opposed it.John A. Boehner, the speaker who has often seemed scared to do anything that his Tea Party colleagues might oppose, not only allowed the vote but chose to vote for the proposal. The first indication of whether this is a new dawn, or simply a case of the House Republicans being outmaneuvered, could come when the debt ceiling is addressed. Logically, the debt ceiling is an absurd vote to begin with. Raising it simply allows the government to pay the bills for spending the Congress already approved. To allow the spending bills to pass, but to then refuse to raise the debt ceiling, is equivalent to a family’s deciding to refuse to pay the credit card bill while continuing to spend. That will only accomplish destruction of the family’s credit.Perhaps some Republicans will threaten to keep the country from paying its bills to accomplish something they don’t otherwise have the votes to accomplish. But if the European precedent holds, the final result will at least avert disaster.Whether more than that can be hoped for may depend in part on whether those screaming for major cuts in federal spending actually believe their rhetoric — the talk about the United States becoming another Greece.The reality is that the current budget deficit largely reflects two things: exceptionally low government revenue and the continuing problems caused by the financial crisis and recession that followed the bursting of the housing bubble. Bringing tax revenue back to historical levels, as well as the growth in revenue and reductions in spending that will automatically follow an improving economy, will make a major difference.There are issues that must be addressed regarding health care costs and Medicare, as well as the fact that there will be fewer workers for each retiree as the baby boomers retire. But those who see a Greek-type crisis here should ask themselves why the government can borrow at interest rates that remain extraordinarily low. The world’s trust in Uncle Sam’s ability to pay its debts has remained high.What are not high are taxes, although a poll would no doubt show that many people think otherwise.Federal taxes, relative to the size of the economy, are significantly lower than they were after Ronald Reagan cut them. During 2012 federal revenue amounted to around 17 percent of gross domestic product. At the Reagan low point, the figure was a full percentage point higher. In 2009, when the deficit was ballooning, the figure fell below 16 percent, something that had happened only once during the more than 60 years for which comparable data is available.Back in 2000, federal revenue approached 21 percent of G.D.P. The assumption that such strong collections would continue played a major role in the forecasts of budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. In 2001, aides to President George W. Bush pointed to the figure as proof that Americans were overtaxed. It turned out that tax revenue figures were temporarily inflated in two ways by the bull market in technology stocks. Not only were there a lot of capital gains to be taxed, but soaring share prices also produced a lot of ordinary income for those employees and executives who could cash in stock options.At the time, it was assumed that such options had no significant impact on tax revenue, because the income that went to the employee provided an offsetting tax deduction for the company that issued the options. That might have been true had the companies been paying taxes, but many of the most bubbly stocks were in companies that never had, and never would, pay a dollar in income taxes.That revenue would have come down sharply after the technology stock bubble burst, even without the Bush tax cuts. But those tax cuts worsened the situation and are a major cause of the current deficits.It might be interesting to consider what would have happened in the 2012 presidential campaign had either candidate been willing to, as Adlai Stevenson once said, “talk sense to the American people.”In reality, neither candidate would have dreamed of saying, as an economist did a week ago: “Ultimately, unless we scale back entitlement programs far more than anyone in Washington is now seriously considering, we will have no choice but to increase taxes on a vast majority of Americans. This could involve higher tax rates or an elimination of popular deductions. Or it could mean an entirely new tax, such as a value-added tax or a carbon tax.”It would have been only a little more likely to hear a candidate say, as another economist said after the fiscal deal was reached, “We need a tax system that can promote economic growth and raise the revenue the American people want to devote to government.”The first quote came from a column in The New York Times by N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. The second statement was made W. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia University business school, who was chairman of the president’s Council of Economic Advisers when the Bush tax cuts were enacted. He went on to say, a Times article reported, that some Bush-era policies were no longer relevant to the task of tailoring a tax code to a properly sized government.Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Hubbard were among the top economic advisers to Mr. Romney. If they advised him to make similar statements during the campaign, he did not take the advice.“Fiscal negotiations might become a bit easier if everyone started by agreeing that the policies we choose must be constrained by the laws of arithmetic,” Mr. Mankiw added."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"Stocks fell on Thursday after an account of the Federal Reserve’s last meeting revealed a split among bank officials over how long the Fed should keep buying bonds to support the economy.The decline ended a rally that was ignited when lawmakers passed a bill to avoid a combination of government spending cuts and tax increases that economists had warned might tip the nation’s economy back into recession.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 308 points on Wednesday, its largest point gain since December 2011.On Thursday, the Dow fell 21.19 points, or 0.16 percent, to 13,391.36. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 3.05 points, or 0.21 percent, to 1,459.37. The Nasdaq composite index fell 11.70 points, or 0.38 percent, to 3,100.57.The Dow and the S.& P. fell into the red after the Federal Reserve released the minutes from its December meeting.At last month’s meeting of the Federal Reserve’s policy-making committee, the central bank pledged to buy $85 billion of Treasurys and mortgage-backed bonds and to keep a benchmark interest rate near zero until the unemployment rate drops below 6.5 percent.On Thursday, the minutes from that meeting showed Fed officials were divided over the bond purchases. “It’s pretty surprising,” said Thomas Simons, market economist at the investment bank Jefferies. “I think everybody thought there was broad agreement on policy, but now it seems like few of them really wanted to vote for it.”The stock market opened on a weak note after retailers reported mixed holiday sales and as the prospect of a new budget battle in Congress loomed.“It’s natural to relax a bit after such a huge day as yesterday,” said Lawrence Creatura, who manages a small-company fund at Federated Investors.“We’re off to a very strong start,” Mr. Creatura said. “The dominant reason is the resolution of the fiscal cliff. But January is usually a strong month as investors all shift money into the market at the same time. When the calendar flips, it’s as if you’re allowed to begin the race anew.”Economists had warned that the full force of impending tax changes could drag the country into a recession. The law passed late Tuesday night averted that outcome, but other fiscal squabbles are likely in the months ahead. Congress must raise the government’s borrowing limit soon or be forced to choose between slashing spending and paying its debts.In other Thursday trading, interest rates rose. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 22/32, to 97 14/32, and the yield rose to 1.91 percent from 1.84 percent late Wednesday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/business/global/bank-lending-in-euro-zone-slumped-in-november-data-show.html,"FRANKFURT — Bank lending to companies in the euro zone continued to slump in November, according to official data published Thursday that could encourage expectations of an interest-rate cut by the European Central Bank as early as next week.In its monthly report on lending, the central bank said Thursday that loans to companies, not including banks, in the 17-nation currency zone fell at an annual rate of 1.8 percent in November, the same rate of decline as in October.That is a sign that measures by the bank have not yet succeeded in restoring the flow of credit to troubled countries like Spain. Credit is a prerequisite for economic growth, and the central bank closely watches data on lending in deciding the level of the official interest rate.During the last year the central bank has gone to ever greater lengths to encourage lending. It has cut the benchmark interest rate to a record low of 0.75 percent and allowed banks effectively to borrow as much money as they want at that rate.The central bank has also promised to buy the bonds of countries like Spain to hold down their borrowing costs, a policy intended to help businesses and consumers in the countries hardest hit by recession.The interest rate that a government pays often acts as a floor on the market rates paid by the country’s companies and consumers.But the central bank’s efforts have been thwarted by continued reluctance by banks, many of which are already burdened by bad loans and are trying to reduce risk. In some countries there may also be a lack of demand for loans, because corporate managers are not confident enough to resume investing in their businesses.“Today’s euro zone bank lending figures are a timely reminder that the economic situation in the 17-country region remains very fragile,” Martin van Vliet, an analyst at ING Bank, wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.Lending to euro zone households continued to register only weak growth, rising at an annual rate of 0.4 percent in November, the same rate as in October, the central bank said.The latest data could reinforce expectations that the bank will cut the benchmark rate early this year, perhaps as soon as the monthly monetary policy meeting next Thursday.But a rate cut would most likely face opposition from some members of the central bank’s governing council, including Jens Weidmann, president of the Bundesbank, the German central bank.Mr. Weidmann and others might argue that lower rates would increase the risk of inflation, without doing much to encourage lending in the countries that need it most.In interviews and other public statements, Mr. Weidmann has continued to warn about inflation even though most economists see little risk.Inflation in the euro area fell to an annual rate of 2.2 percent in November from 2.5 percent in October, according to the most recent official figures. The central bank aims to keep inflation at about 2 percent.The report on monetary conditions did contain some good news. Mr. van Vliet pointed out that bank deposits in Spain and Greece rose in November, a sign that people were no longer withdrawing money from those two countries.“This confirms that fears of a (partial) euro zone breakup are gradually receding,” Mr. van Vliet wrote.And while the German economy has slowed in recent months, unemployment numbers released Thursday suggested that it remained resilient. The unemployment rate rose to 6.7 percent from 6.5 percent, the German Federal Employment Agency said. Adjusting for seasonal fluctuations, however, the unemployment rate was unchanged at 6.9 percent. About 2.9 million people in Germany are jobless.The stable German labor market, despite poor weather that would normally suppress hiring, is a sign that “most firms do not expect the currently weak economic environment to persist for much longer,” Thomas Harjes, an analyst at Barclays, wrote in a note.According to the methodology used by the International Labor Organization, which uses a narrower definition of joblessness, Germany’s unemployment rate was only 5.3 percent.A report by the Bank of England Thursday indicated that the British central bank is having better luck restoring credit to the economy than the European Central Bank. Lending to both businesses and consumers rose significantly, the Bank of England said in its quarterly credit conditions survey.Britain is not a member of the euro zone, and the Bank of England undoubtedly faces a less complex task than the European Central Bank, which must try to fashion a monetary policy for 17 countries.The Bank of England attributed the improvement to its Funding for Lending Scheme, which rewards banks that increase the amount of credit they provide. Banks that lend more can borrow more from the central bank at lower rates than banks that decrease lending.“The Funding for Lending Scheme was widely cited as contributing towards the increase in secured and corporate credit availability,” the Bank of England said in a statement."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/your-money/fiscal-deal-ends-decade-of-uncertainty-over-gift-and-estate-taxes.html,"FOR many of the wealthy, the American Taxpayer Relief Act, passed this week by Congress, is aptly named.For estate and gift taxes in particular, all but the richest of the rich will probably be able to protect their holdings from taxes, now that Congress has permanently set the estate and gift tax exemptions at $5 million (a level that will rise with inflation).“You could say this eliminates the estate tax for 99 percent of the population, though I’ve seen figures that say 99.7 or 99.8,” said Richard A. Behrendt, director of estate planning at the financial services firm Baird and a former inspector for the Internal Revenue Service. “From a policy point of view, the estate tax is not there for raising revenue. It’s there for a check on the massive concentration of wealth in a few hands, and it will still accomplish that.”And while Congress also agreed to increase tax rates on dividends and capital gains to 20 percent from 15 percent for top earners — in addition to the 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on such earnings — the rates are still far lower than those on their ordinary income. For the earners at the very top, whose income comes mostly from their portfolios of investments, and not a paycheck like most of the rest of us, this is a good deal.The estate tax, once an arcane assessment, has been in flux and attracting significant attention since 2001. That was when the exemption per person for the estate tax began to rise gradually from $675,000, with a 55 percent tax for anything above that amount, to $3.5 million in 2009 with a 45 percent tax rate for estates larger than that. Estate plans were written to account for the predictable increases in exemptions.Then in 2010, contrary to what every accountant and tax lawyer I spoke to at the time believed would happen, the estate tax disappeared. Congress and President Obama could not reach an agreement on the tax. So that year, for the first time since 1916, Americans who died were not subject to a federal estate tax. (Their estates still paid state estate taxes, where they existed, and other taxes, including capital gains, on the value of the assets transferred.)At the end of 2010, President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner reached an agreement that was just as unlikely as the estate tax expiring in the first place: the new exemption was $5 million, indexed to inflation, with a 35 percent tax rate on any amount over that, and it would last for two years. The taxes and exemptions for gifts made during someone’s lifetime to children and grandchildren were also raised to the same level, from $1 million and a 55 percent tax above that.As I have written many times, this was a far better rate and exemption than anyone expected. It also created a deadline of Dec. 31, 2012, for people who could make a major gift up to the exemption level or above the amount and pay the low gift tax.Using the gift exemption was enticing because it meant those assets would appreciate outside of the estate of the person making the gift. Even paying the tax became attractive to the very rich because of how estate and gift taxes are levied. Take, for example, someone who has used up his exemption and wants to give an heir $1 million. The amount it would take to accomplish this differs depending on when it is given. In life, it would cost $1.4 million because the 40 percent gift tax is paid like a sales tax. If it was given after death, the estate would have to set aside about $1.65 million after the 40 percent estate tax was deducted. But this presented a conundrum: while it may make perfect sense to give away a lot of money during your lifetime and save on estate taxes, it means ceding control of cash, securities or shares now. What if you end up needing them? It wasn’t an easy decision, and it led to a fourth-quarter rush.As of this week, this is no longer an issue. The estate and gift tax exemptions are permanently set at the same $5 million level, indexed for inflation, and the tax rate above that exemption is 40 percent, up from 35 percent. With indexing, the exemption is already about $5.25 million per person — double for a couple — and it will rise at a rate that means most Americans will continue to avoid paying any federal estate tax.“The new law yields a lot of clarity,” said Dan Kesten, a law partner at Davis & Gilbert. “We can educate our clients more, and it will be easier for them to make decisions.”Mr. Kesten added: “For less wealthy people, they may not need much estate planning. I think we’re back to the days of more straightforward wills and not much need for lifetime wealth transfers.”Still, there are a few unresolved issues.REGRETS Given that the exemption was set to return to $1 million with a 55 percent tax rate above that, many people rushed to take advantage of the maximum gift tax exemption before the year ended. They may now be feeling a New Year’s hangover that could last for some time, particularly if they could not really afford to give all they gave.Mr. Behrendt said people who went a step further and set up complicated structures, like trusts that allowed spouses access to the money or family limited partnerships, may want to undo them. But they could run afoul of the I.R.S.“Can they do it?” he asked. “Not legally. Once you transfer to children or grandchildren, their ownership rights are vested.”John Dadakis, a law partner at Holland & Knight, said someone could try to argue that the gift was not legitimate and that it was made under the assumption that the ability to do so was going away. But he said a better approach would be to think of those assets as now growing in the estates of your children and grandchildren.“You’re way ahead of the game now,” he said.CURRENT CONCERNS While federal estate taxes will not hit most of the affluent anymore, this group has other concerns.The big one is state estate taxes. While only Connecticut has a state tax on gifts, about 20 states have estate taxes with much lower exemptions than the federal tax. In New Jersey, for example, the exemption is $675,000. In New York and Massachusetts, it is $1 million. Above those amounts, the tax rates range from 5 to 16 percent.Many people may plan to retire to states like Florida that have no state estate tax. But as Leiha Macauley, head of the Boston office of the Day Pitney law firm, pointed out, you can’t always plan when you will die.She said one way to deal with this was to set up trusts that preserve each spouse’s state exemption level. These are the same types of trusts that spouses created to take advantage of the federal exemption before this law made permanent the ability for a spouse to use a deceased spouse’s exemptions. (This is what is known as portability.)On the positive side for the affluent, a separate gift exemption known as the annual exclusion has also been indexed for inflation. It is $14,000 this year, up from $13,000 last year. It is set to rise every few years at $1,000 increments.“In a couple of years, it’s going to be $30,000 per couple, and you can give that amount to anyone you want,” Ms. Macauley said. “We have a couple who gives the maximum. They’ve given just over $2 million in the past few years.”THE FUTURE The very rich could still face estate taxes, but there continue to be sophisticated ways for them to shield many times the exemption levels.Mitchell A. Drossman, national director of wealth planning strategies for U.S. Trust, said two of the big tools that planners had feared would be changed but were not are grantor-retained annuity trusts — which allow the appreciation on the asset put into the trust to pass to someone else tax-free — and the ability to discount shares in a family business because the shares are not as liquid as stock in a public company.Another concern is that the very rich will become lax in their planning. Carol G. Kroch, a managing director for wealth and philanthropic planning at Wilmington Trust, said trusts would still be important to families.“One of the things that people dealing with wealth need to think about is how do you manage it,” she said. “A long-term trust is like an endowment for a family. You can still create that pool of wealth. You just don’t have that gun to your head.”But as we saw, deadline pressure is often needed to get people, including elected officials, to act."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/opinion/is-google-like-gas-or-like-steel.html,"AFTER a two-year investigation, the Federal Trade Commission concluded this week that Google’s search practices did not violate antitrust law. Those who wanted to see an epic battle like the one the government fought with Microsoft in the 1990s were sorely disappointed. But the analogy to the browser war of the Web’s early days was never the right one. It failed to capture the dangers free speech would have faced if regulators had agreed with Google’s critics.The theories that many critics advanced — that search must be “neutral” because it is akin to a public utility, or that computer-generated search results are not speech and therefore not protected under the First Amendment — would have undermined free press principles across the Internet. That the F.T.C. decision permits Google to continue to use its judgment in analyzing search requests and presenting pertinent results is a victory for online expression and is consistent with First Amendment law since the 1940s.Seven decades ago, a lawsuit against The Associated Press applied antitrust rules to the media and was resolved in a way that ultimately protected First Amendment interests. This case was always a better parallel than Microsoft to the F.T.C. investigation of Google. Like Google today, The A.P. had extraordinary influence. Then as now there were questions about whether something more than common antitrust law should govern companies that play such an important role in the delivery of information to the public.Back then, the Justice Department alleged that A.P. bylaws allowed its member papers to impede local competitors by denying them access to The A.P.’s expansive news network. A trial court agreed but applied a theory far broader than routine antitrust law. It held that news was not an “ordinary” product like “steel” governed solely by antitrust, but rather something more “vital” because it was “clothed with a public interest.”In other words, the trial court wanted to treat the mass media like a public utility, which carried considerable consequences. For example, while it would be illegal under antitrust law for a large steel company to conspire with competitors to fix prices, that company has no obligation to sell to every carmaker that wants steel. A public utility, on the other hand, has to serve everyone in the marketplace equally. Applying that standard to The A.P. would have opened the door to far broader regulation and could, in theory, have meant something as absurd as requiring newspapers to cover every press release or publish every letter to the editor.When the case reached the Supreme Court in 1945, the modern understanding of the First Amendment, with its insistence on an independent news media, had yet to take shape. So it was with great significance that — even though The A.P. lost its appeal and had to allow more access to its services — the court steered entirely clear of the public-utility model. It looked instead to standard antitrust law in finding The A.P.’s conduct to be a classic restraint on trade.The court went further in setting down a marker that to this day restrains government regulation of the media. Justice Hugo L. Black, who would become a leading champion of the First Amendment, wrote that nothing in the ruling could “compel A.P. or its members to permit publication of anything which their ‘reason’ tells them should not be published.”This began a historic run in which the court transformed the media into an institution with the autonomy to serve as a check on government power. The First Amendment as we know it would look very different if public utility obligations had been forced onto the press that day.If The A.P. was concerned about a regulator in every newsroom, Google was concerned about a regulator in every algorithm.Advocates of aggressive action against Google saw the computer algorithms behind search as a utility that should be heavily regulated like the gas or electricity that flows into our homes. But search engines need to make choices about what results are most relevant to a query, just as a news editor must decide which stories deserve to be on the front page. Requiring “search neutrality” would have placed the government in the business of policing the speech of the Internet’s information providers. To quote Justice Black, it would have made search engines publish those results “which their ‘reason’ tells them should not be published.”Others argued that the F.T.C. did not need to be guided by First Amendment concerns at all because search results are created by computers, not by human beings. Yet computers “speak” in many ways today. Lawmakers could have used F.T.C. precedent against Google to regulate the content of Amazon’s book recommendations, the locations on Bing’s maps, the news stories that trend on Facebook and Twitter, and many other online expressions of social and political importance.The F.T.C. resisted these harmful theories, and as a result speakers all over the Internet won. But that doesn’t mean Google is exempt from regulation. The First Amendment is not a grant of immunity for any business, and antitrust scrutiny does not end where editorial judgment begins. But the A.P. case shows that antitrust laws can be enforced while protecting the right of a free press to print what it chooses and nothing more.This makes regulation of the media difficult. But regulating speech should not be easy, like regulating a public utility, but hard, as the F.T.C. has correctly found."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/business/economy/global-manufacturing-edges-up-except-in-europe.html,"THE slowdown in worldwide manufacturing that began in mid-2012 may be nearing an end.Surveys of manufacturing companies around the world indicated that in December nearly as many companies reported that orders were rising as said that orders were continuing to decline.The gains were concentrated in developing countries; China reported its best month in nearly two years.But much of the euro zone remained weak. France reported its worst monthly figure since early 2009, when the credit crisis was at its worst.The figures are based on monthly surveys of manufacturers begun in the United States by the Institute for Supply Management and later imitated in more than a dozen countries by Markit, a British firm. Companies are asked whether business is better than in the previous month, both over all and by several measurements. The accompanying charts focus on whether companies say the volume of new orders coming in is improving or getting worse.The I.S.M. numbers use 50 as a neutral point. Any number above that indicates that more companies are reporting good news than are reporting that things are getting worse. In the charts, the numbers are adjusted so that such a neutral reading is shown as zero, with higher figures showing an ever greater proportion of companies reporting good news.The global figure, compiled by J. P. Morgan based on all the surveys, remained in negative territory in December, but it came closer to breaking even than it had in any month since May.In the United States, according to the Institute for Supply Management survey, a plurality of companies reported declining orders for three months through September, but since then the figures have been positive, although by very narrow margins in November and December. Export orders appeared to be stronger in December than domestic orders, perhaps indicating some caution from domestic buyers as the so-called fiscal cliff deadline approached.The weakness in the euro zone has lasted more than a year, but for most of that period it was the peripheral countries that were holding down the reports. In December, though, both Germany and France, the two largest economies in the currency union, had worse order reports than the zone as a whole, something that had happened only once before since the end of 2007.For much of this year, most of the major developing country exporters were reporting declining levels of new orders. But China and Brazil have shown positive margins for three months as the year ended, and South Korea had a narrowly positive number in December, its first in seven months."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/business/after-fiscal-deal-tax-code-may-be-most-progressive-since-1979.html,"WASHINGTON — With 2013 bringing tax increases on the incomes of a small sliver of the richest Americans, the country’s top earners now face a heavier tax burden than at any time since Jimmy Carter was president.The last-minute deal struck by the departing 112th Congress raised taxes on a handful of the highest-earning Americans, with about 99.3 percent of households experiencing no change in their income taxes. But the Tax Policy Center estimates that the average family in the top 1 percent will pay a federal tax rate of more than 36 percent this year, up from 28 percent in 2008. That is the highest rate since 1979, at least.By some measures, the tax code might now be the most progressive in a generation, tax economists said, while noting that every American is paying a lower burden currently than they did then. In fact, the total federal tax rate is still vastly lower for the very rich than it was at any point in the 1940s through 1970s. It has risen from historical lows, but is still closer to those lows than where it was in the postwar decades.“We made the system more progressive by raising rates at the top and leaving them for everyone else,” said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a research group based in Washington. “The offsetting issue is that the rich have gotten a lot richer.”Indeed, over the last three decades the bulk of pretax income gains have gone to the wealthy — and the higher up on the income scale, the bigger the gains, with billionaires outpacing millionaires who outpaced the merely rich. Economists doubted that the tax increases would do much to reverse that trend.With the recovery failing to improve incomes for millions of average Americans and the country running trillion-dollar deficits, President Obama made “tax fairness” a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. In the heated negotiations with House Speaker John A. Boehner, that translated into the White House’s insistence on tax increases for the top 2 percent of households and a continuation of tax breaks and cuts for a vast number of taxpayers.Republicans resisted increasing tax rates and aimed for lower revenue targets, arguing that spending was the budget’s primary problem and that no American should see his or her taxes go up too much in such a sluggish economy. But ultimately they relented, and Congress cut a last-minute deal.“A central promise of my campaign for president was to change the tax code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working middle-class Americans,” Mr. Obama said after Congress reached an agreement.That deal includes a host of tax increases on the rich. It raises the tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on income above $400,000 for individuals, and $450,000 for couples. The rate on dividends and capital gains for those same taxpayers was bumped up 5 percentage points, to 20 percent. Congress also reinstated limits on the amount households with more than $300,000 in income can deduct. On top of that, two new surcharges — a 3.8 percent tax on investment income and a 0.9 percent tax on regular income — hit those same wealthy households.As a result of the taxes added in both the deal and the 2010 health care law, which came into effect this year, taxpayers with $1 million in income and up will pay on average $168,000 more in taxes. Millionaires’ share of the overall federal tax burden will climb to 23 percent from 20 percent.The result is a tax code that squeezes hundreds of billions of dollars more from the very well off — about $600 billion more over 10 years — while leaving the tax burden on everyone else mostly as it was. And the changes come after 30 years of both Republican and Democratic administrations doing the converse: zeroing out federal income taxes for many poor working families while also reducing the tax burden for households on the higher end of the income scale.“Back at the end of the Carter and beginning of the Reagan administrations, we had a pretty severe income-tax burden for people at a low level of income. It was actually kind of appalling,” said Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-of-center research group in Washington. “Policy makers in both parties realized that was bad policy and started whittling away at it” by expanding credits and tinkering with tax rates.After those changes and the new law, comparing average tax rates for poor households and wealthy households, 2013 might be the most progressive tax code since 1979. But economists cautioned that measuring progressivity is tricky. “It’s not like there is some scientific measure of progressivity all economists agreed upon,” said Leonard E. Burman, a professor of public affairs at Syracuse University. “People look at different numerical measures and they’ve changed in different ways at different income levels.”Mr. Viard said that over time the code had become markedly more progressive for the poor compared with the middle class. But it arguably did not become much more progressive for the rich compared with the middle class, or the very rich compared with the rich, in part because of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts on investment income.An anesthesiologist who earns a $500,000 salary subject to payroll and income taxes might pay a higher tax rate than a hedge fund manager making $1 billion subject mostly to capital-gains taxes, for instance.Economists are also divided on the ultimate effect of those tax increases on the wealthy to income growth and income inequality in the United States. The recession hit the incomes of the rich hard, but they have snapped back much more strongly than those for middle or low-income workers.“I’d still rather be really rich, even if I’m getting taxed much more than a low-income person” would be, Mr. Williams of the Tax Policy Center added."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/technology/in-google-patent-case-ftc-set-rules-of-engagement-for-battles.html,"The Federal Trade Commission’s antitrust investigation of Google focused mainly on the company’s lucrative search business, while its inquiry into the tech giant’s handling of patents seemed an afterthought.Yet even as Google made only a few voluntary promises on search, it agreed to a legal settlement on patents that Jon Leibowitz, the commission chairman, called a “landmark enforcement action” that applies to huge high-tech markets like smartphones and tablet computers.The commission action by no means spells the end of the smartphone patent wars, a global conflict in which major corporations including Apple, Samsung and Google have spent billions amassing patent portfolios and then suing and countersuing one another in courts around the world. But legal experts say Google’s settlement with the F.T.C. signals progress in clarifying the rules of engagement in high-tech patent battles, and thus could ease them.“The agreement represents a significant stride forward in reducing the confusion and uncertainty that currently surrounds how these patents can be used,” said Colleen Chien, a patent expert at the Santa Clara University School of Law.The commission’s settlement with Google, announced on Thursday, focused on patents covering communications and data transmission technologies that are crucial for the basic operation of smartphones and tablets — what are known as standard-essential patents. (There are many other patents in mobile devices, covering physical design and software features.) The legal gamesmanship of the epic smartphone patent battles, according to economists and technology experts, consumes time and investment that could be better used to develop new products. In his comments on Thursday, Mr. Leibowitz pointed to those concerns. “Today’s commission action,” he said, “will also relieve companies of some of the costly and inefficient burden of hoarding patents for purely defensive purposes, savings that we hope can be invested in job-creating research and development.”Under the settlement, Google agreed to license its standard-essential patents to other companies on “fair and reasonable” terms. It also agreed not to seek court injunctions to halt the shipment of smartphones, tablets and other devices that use its standard patents.The issue arose from Google’s $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola Mobility, announced in 2011 and completed last year. Google acquired Motorola partly to defend itself and the smartphone makers that use its Android software after rivals had already loaded up on patents.With the acquisition, Google picked up 17,000 patents, including many relating to wireless devices that Motorola, a pioneer in the wireless phone business, had pledged to license on reasonable terms. Those commitments were made to technology standards organizations, intended to assure that basic technical innovations are widely available, stimulating growth in the industry.Over the years, according to Mr. Leibowitz, companies took Motorola at its word and developed products assuming they could routinely license Motorola’s patents. But Motorola later refused to license its standard-essential patents and sought court injunctions to stop shipment of rival products.“After Google purchased Motorola,” Mr. Leibowitz said, “it continued these same abusive practices.”In recent months, the F.T.C. has issued position papers and filed friend-of-the-court briefs, opposing the motions for injunctions using standard patents. The Justice Department and European regulators have echoed the commission’s stance.“Regulators around the world have become increasingly sensitive to just how important technical standards and standards-setting bodies are to the modern system of economic innovation,” said Josh Lerner, an economist at Harvard Business School.The threat of court injunctions to stop shipment of products, economists say, is the factor that drives up the cost of patent wars. Because an injunction could be devastating, companies will pay dearly to remove that risk, settling with a plaintiff or spending on patents to build a defensive arsenal.Some courts have recently resisted granting injunctions based on standard patents. Google’s settlement with the F.T.C., said Carl Shapiro, a former chief economist in the Justice Department’s antitrust division, “helps solidify the move to stop injunctions in standard-essential patent cases, which is great.”Dr. Shapiro, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley, said that courts had also been more hesitant recently to grant injunctions in cases that did not involve standard patents. In suits involving smartphones and tablets — amalgams of hardware, software and telecommunications technologies covered by many thousands of patents — judges are sometimes less likely to halt the shipment of a device based on a few infringing patents.Last month, for example, Lucy Koh, a Federal District Court judge in San Jose, Calif., denied Apple’s motion for an injunction against Samsung products. In August, a jury in that court found that Samsung products infringed on a handful of Apple design and software patents, and awarded Apple $1.05 billion in damages.Judge Koh declined to grant Apple’s motion for injunction, essentially saying that Apple’s claim was outweighed by the public interest in keeping Samsung shipments flowing. Apple is appealing the ruling.“The courts seem to be moving toward taking a dimmer view of injunctions generally,” Dr. Shapiro said. “That’s a big deal.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/middleeast/fatah-celebration-in-gaza-signals-easing-of-rift-with-hamas.html,"JERUSALEM — Turning the streets of Gaza City into a swarm of sunshine-yellow flags, hundreds of thousands of Palestinians celebrated the anniversary of the Fatah faction on Friday in the heartland of its militant Islamist rival, Hamas, the latest in a series of signals heralding possible reconciliation between the parties after their bitter five-year rift.The rally, which came on the heels of a Hamas celebration last month in the Fatah-dominated West Bank, added momentum to what Palestinian leaders consider their twin victories in November: Hamas’s firing rockets into Israeli population centers of Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Palestine’s upgrade to nonmember observer state status at the United Nations.Though it is unclear if the two sides will ultimately overcome real differences, the show of unity creates a diplomatic quandary for the United States, which has urged Israel to return to negotiations with the Palestinians, but has pushed to exclude Hamas, which it considers a terrorist organization.Nabil A. Shaath, a Fatah leader who organized Friday’s event, and Taher al-Nounou, a Hamas spokesman, each said in separate interviews on Friday evening that they expected reconciliation talks to begin under the auspices of the Egyptians within two weeks. President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt invited President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority to Cairo, Mr. Shaath said, where he is expected to meet with the Hamas political chief, Khaled Meshal.“The climate is excellent for reconciliation,” Mr. Shaath said. “I don’t think there are any more organizational issues to be settled; what is needed is to sit down and write a political program. Cairo remains the best chaperon for this.”Friday’s huge rally, the first Fatah anniversary celebration in Gaza since Hamas took control of the area in 2007, was unimaginable even six weeks ago. Though more than 170 Gazans were killed and dozens of buildings destroyed during the intense eight-day conflict with Israel, and the United Nations upgrade is largely symbolic, the two events seem to have strengthened both Hamas and Fatah in the eyes of the Palestinian public.A mid-December poll by the Palestinian Center for Survey Research showed Mr. Abbas’s approval rating at 54 percent, up from 46 percent in September after a year of free-fall. Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister in Gaza, got an even bigger boost, to 56 percent from 35 percent, and for the first time, the poll showed Mr. Haniya would beat Mr. Abbas in a head-to-head presidential election.Positive evaluations of the conditions in both Gaza and the West Bank also rose significantly, and 39 percent said they expected unity between the two areas to soon be restored, nearly triple the portion who said so three months before. Granting permission for rivals to hold rallies is one thing, analysts said, but compromising on core principles and actually sharing power quite another. Recent public statements by Mr. Abbas, Mr. Haniya and Mr. Meshal show great gulfs remain regarding how to deal with Israel, among other things, and Palestinian political experts said they were not as confident as people in the street that such differences would be quickly worked out.“Neither side is willing to be seen as responsible for the continuation of disunity, so they give lip service to reconciliation, but they realize fully that reconciliation at this point is not on the agenda,” said Khalil Shikaki, who heads the Ramallah-based center for survey research. “Reconciliation now means it will come at a price for one of the two, and neither side is willing to pay the price at the moment.”Mkhaimar Abusada, a political scientist at Al Azhar University in Gaza City, said relations between the parties have clearly improved since the Gaza conflict, but he called the rallies, telephone calls between leaders and exchange of political prisoners “confidence-building measures,” not substantive progress. He and others noted that the factions have signed no fewer than four peace pacts in the past five years, none of which have been fulfilled, and that those agreements call for establishing a national unity government, holding presidential and parliamentary elections and reconstituting the Palestine Liberation Organization to include Hamas, among other things.“What we see now is some kind of moral reconciliation,” Professor Abusada said. “Hamas and Fatah are no longer inciting against each other, Hamas and Fatah are no longer accusing each other, but the big issues have not been tackled yet.”Israel and the United States have expressed deep concerns about the prospect of reconciliation, particularly now that an emboldened Gaza leadership feels it has the upper hand. Twice in the last few days, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has warned in public comments that Hamas could “take over” the Palestinian Authority. Last month, after Mr. Meshal promised at his own huge Gaza rally to liberate Palestine “from the river to the sea,” Mr. Netanyahu condemned Mr. Abbas for considering a full partnership with him.On Friday, Mr. Abbas, who has not stepped foot in Gaza since 2007, appeared via video feed from Ramallah calling for reconciliation.“Soon we will achieve unity and end the occupation, raising the Palestinian flag over Al Aqsa Mosque and Jerusalem,” he told the large crowd, according to the Ma’an news agency. “Our whole lives under occupation and siege, our eyes are now fixed on Jerusalem and we must all take this opportunity to combine our efforts, hearts, and our determination to save Jerusalem, our capital.”The president was the only official to address the rally, organizers said, with other speeches as well as a much-anticipated dance program canceled because of the surprise turnout. Health officials in Gaza said 50 people were injured, three seriously, in falls from high perches, electrical accidents, and near-suffocations.“It was so noisy and the sound system was not really coping,” Mr. Shaath said afterward. “I have a Ph.D. in management, but I have absolutely no experience in management of one million people in celebration.”Crowd estimates ranged from 300,000 to 1.2 million, in any case a large portion of Gaza’s 1.7 million people. Many may not have been active supporters of Fatah, but people who wanted to show unity or simply watch the spectacle. Thousands, including lots of families, spent Thursday night in Saraya Square to ensure themselves a spot, and by dusk on Friday, the throngs had not fully dispersed. After a mass prayer at noon, witnesses said, most of the hours were spent singing revolutionary songs from Fatah’s early days and waving flags.“We came from the early morning, it’s like a holiday,” said a 23-year-old woman from Beit Hanoun, in the north of the strip, who gave only her first name, Amani. “We are coming today because we have been oppressed for five years. We wish that this will be the first step of unity.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/europe/debit-and-credit-card-purchases-shut-down-at-vatican.html,"VATICAN CITY — If you’re planning a trip to the Vatican, be sure to take cash.Since Wednesday, museums and businesses there have been declining credit card and debit card purchases after a decision by the Bank of Italy that is linked to concerns over financial accountability and inadequate money-laundering controls.Cash machines have also been shut down, except for those with a Vatican Bank debit card, after the Italian central bank refused authorization for Deutsche Bank’s Italian unit to continue providing services within the Vatican’s walls.Some commentators have mused on the paradox of telling people to use cash when trying to monitor money-laundering activities. The Vatican has played down the episode, passing it off as a temporary glitch after the expiration of an agreement between some Holy See offices and the current provider of its electronic point-of-sale services.The Vatican spokesman, Federico Lombardi, told reporters this week that discussions with other providers were under way, and that the interruption of credit card and debit card purchases “would be short-lived.”But the Bank of Italy’s actions underscore larger concerns about the transparency of the Vatican’s finances, something that Pope Benedict XVI has promised to fix.The Bank of Italy — which monitors the activities of Italian banking institutions, even in foreign states — did not issue a formal statement. But financial experts said the bank’s decision reflected concrete concerns over banking and financial legislation at Vatican City State, as well as an inadequate system of independent supervision.While the Holy See has traditionally been tight-lipped about the dealings of its primary financial institution, the Institute for Works of Religion, also known as the Vatican Bank, the Vatican has worked in recent years to comply with international transparency and money-laundering standards, with mixed results.A report evaluating measures to combat money laundering and terrorist financing issued last July by Moneyval, an official European financial watchdog, found that the Vatican bank had come a long way in a short time, yet still lagged in monitoring suspicious activities and did not carry out sufficient due diligence.Under Benedict, the Vatican has undertaken a series of measures to become more transparent, even hiring a Swiss anti-money-laundering expert, René Brülhart, to oversee the process. Mr. Brülhart’s brief involves getting the Vatican added to a “white list” of territories judged to comply with international standards on combating financial crime.As the current ban on credit cards suggests, the Vatican’s efforts to clean up its finances have been only partly successful. Vatican museum officials said Friday that the credit card ban had not hurt attendance. “The museums are full, and people can still reserve tickets online, so everything seems to be working well,” said Lucina Vattuone, of the Vatican Museum Press Office, noting, however, that making reservations online would be possible only until Jan. 15.At least one visitor on Friday, Marcos Roade of Mexico, could attest to that. “The real problem is that there are too many people in the museums,” he said. “It’s not a museum, it’s a business.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/us/politics/owners-of-auto-racetracks-retain-a-tax-break.html,"WASHINGTON — In the rush to pass tax legislation, owners of auto racetracks scored a victory this week even as many other industries were left behind.With the help of devoted Nascar fans in Congress and lobbyists in Washington, track owners secured a one-year extension of an expiring tax break that allows them to write off investments in their property over 7 years, rather than the more typical 15 years.That break for speed racing and similar benefits granted to select businesses in the new tax deal will cost the Treasury tens of millions of dollars over the next decade, at the same time the government struggles with its growing debt.“This allows us to compete with football, baseball and basketball, whose facilities are often financed with state and local tax money,” said Daniel W. Houser, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the International Speedway Corporation of Daytona Beach, Fla., which owns and operates 13 auto racetracks. He said the tax provision would allow the company to carry out a “a robust capital spending plan.”Mr. Houser described the tax break as a form of economic stimulus. “We have shovel-ready projects that are ready to put people to work,” he said.Preservation of such tax breaks came as lawmakers said they were scouring the budget and the tax code for every dollar that could be saved. After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, federal debt is bumping up against the legal limit of $16.4 trillion.The tax break for “motorsports entertainment complexes,” a part of the tax bill signed Wednesday by President Obama, is estimated to cost $78 million over 10 years. It would cost more if it were extended again or made permanent, as the industry wants. By contrast, Congress sliced billions of dollars from hospitals and other health care providers.A few years ago, enthusiasm for motor sports soared, but in recent years Nascar and others like the IndyCar Series have struggled. The recession crimped the wallets of Nascar’s typically middle-aged, working-class fan base.The auto racetrack provision was one of many business tax breaks extended by Congress. Others continue tax incentives for film and television productions and for railroad track maintenance. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, included the auto racetrack provision in a long list of “special interest giveaways.”But supporters said it was justified, even at a time of big budget deficits. “This tax provision is a job creator,” said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and co-chairman of the Congressional Motorsports Caucus.Nascar, based in Daytona Beach and controlled by the France family, has an influential voice in Washington. Its employees made $347,400 in campaign contributions in the 2012 cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, a site that tracks campaign donations.Marcus Jadotte, a vice president of Nascar, said that while his company did not represent racetracks directly affected by the legislation, “we support the efforts of Congress to preserve the same tax treatment that motorsports facilities have been operating under for decades.”International Speedway, the Nascar sister company that owns and operates racetracks, derives 90 percent of its revenue from Nascar events.Mr. Houser said the tax break could also benefit hundreds of racetracks owned by other companies like Speedway Motorsports and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Nascar and International Speedway are members of the National Motorsports Coalition, which lobbied for the tax break in meetings with lawmakers.Wayne Allard, a Republican former senator from Colorado who is now vice president for government relations at the American Motorcyclist Association, a member of the coalition, said that membership and interest in the association had waned, with the group now running about 3,000 events a year, down from 4,000. The tax break, besides encouraging physical improvements at tracks and creating jobs, could help “prop up our membership,” he said.Among those who lobbied for the tax break was John F. Kelly Jr. of Cornerstone Government Affairs, a Capitol Hill firm that represents International Speedway. Mr. Kelly was a tax policy adviser at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush and then director of federal relations for Walmart.With passage of the tax bill, Mr. Kelly and his firm also won a victory for another client, Beam Inc., whose Cruzan rum is distilled in the United States Virgin Islands. The new law continues an arrangement under which federal excise taxes on imported rum are shared with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The territories have used the money to promote and assist the rum industry and to finance economic development projects.The tax break in the new federal law closely resembles the language of racetrack tax bills introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, home to the auto industry and the Michigan International Speedway; Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, home of the Daytona International Speedway; and Dean Heller, a Republican senator and former representative from Nevada, home of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.Among the co-sponsors, or chief backers, were Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, home of the Kansas Speedway, and the senators from North Carolina, home base for many race teams and the Nascar industry — Richard M. Burr, a Republican, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat.Also supporting the legislation was Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, whose love for the sport earned him the nickname Mr. Nascar. Mr. Kyl, who just retired from Congress, used to volunteer at the Phoenix International Raceway.Ms. Stabenow’s Web site includes pictures of her at a Nascar race at the Michigan track in August.But Cullen Schwarz, a spokesman for Ms. Stabenow, said of the tax break: “This is not a special deal for Nascar. It’s for racetrack companies. It keeps them on a seven-year depreciation schedule, the same as other entertainment venues with major capital expenditures like amusement parks.”Nascar, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was founded by Bill France Sr. in December 1947, and the family continues to own and operate the business today. His son, Bill Jr., was head of Nascar until 2000, and currently, Bill France Sr.’s grandson, Brian France, is Nascar’s chairman and chief executive. Brian’s sister, Lesa France Kennedy, serves on Nascar’s board and is the chief executive of the International Speedway Corporation.Brian France and Lesa France Kennedy have held fund-raisers for Mr. Buchanan at the Daytona speedway and have become regular donors to Republican and Democratic campaigns.In Charlotte, N.C., in August, Mr. France and several team owners held a fund-raiser for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, who had stirred a political fuss by saying he had “some great friends that are Nascar team owners.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/business/economy/us-economy-adds-155000-jobs-jobless-rate-is-7-8.html,"Despite concerns about looming tax increases and government spending cuts, American employers added 155,000 jobs in December. Employees also enjoyed slightly faster wage growth and worked longer hours, which could bode well for future hiring.The job growth, almost exactly equal to the average monthly growth in the last two years, was enough to keep the unemployment rate steady at 7.8 percent, the Labor Department reported on Friday. But it was not enough to reduce the backlog of 12.2 million jobless workers, underscoring the challenge facing Washington politicians as they continue to wrestle over how to address the budget deficit.“Job creation might firm a little bit, but it’s still looking nothing like the typical recovery year we’ve had in deep recessions in the past,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. “There’s nothing in the deal to do that,” he said, referring to Congress’s Jan. 1 compromise on taxes, “and nothing in this latest jobs report to suggest that. We’re a long way short of the 300,000 job growth that we need.”If anything, the most visible debt-related options that policy makers are discussing could slow down economic and job growth, which, at its existing pace, would take seven years to reduce the unemployment rate to its prerecession level. The $110 billion in across-the-board federal spending cuts scheduled for March 1, for example, might provoke layoffs by local governments, military contractors and other companies that depend on federal funds.A showdown over the debt ceiling expected in late February could also damage business confidence, as it did the last time Congress nearly allowed a default on the nation’s debts in August 2011.“We may be seeing the calm before the storm right now,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, noting that a recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business found that alarmingly few small companies planned to hire in the coming months. “Small businesses are wringing their hands in horror at what’s going on in Washington.”A best case for the economy, many analysts say, would involve a swift and civil Congressional agreement that raised the debt ceiling immediately. It would also address the country’s long-term debt challenges, like Medicare costs, without sudden or draconian fiscal tightening this year.Given the uncertainty over what Congress will do, estimates of the unemployment rate’s path this year vary wildly. The more optimistic forecasts for the end of 2013 predict that unemployment will fall to just above 7 percent, which would be considerably below its most recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009, but still higher than its prerecession level of 5 percent.The job gains in December were driven by hiring in health care, food services, construction and manufacturing. The last two industries were probably helped by rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy.Aside from the wild card of what happens in Washington, some encouraging trends in the economy — including the housing recovery, looser credit for small businesses, a rebound in China and pent-up demand for new automobiles — suggest that businesses have good reason to speed up hiring.Congress’s last-minute deal to raise taxes this week will offset some of these sources of growth, since higher taxes trim how much money consumers have available each month.President Obama’s proposals to spend more money on infrastructure projects and other measures intended to spur hiring are fiercely opposed by Republican deficit hawks. The fiscal compromise reached this week did include one modest form of stimulus, though: a one-year renewal of the federal government’s emergency unemployment benefits program. That program allows workers to continue receiving benefits for up to 73 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate in the state where they live, and stimulates economic activity because unemployment benefits are spent almost immediately.The extension was a tremendous relief to the two million workers who would otherwise have lost their benefits this week.“We woke up on Wednesday morning and saw the news and just said, ‘Thank God, thank God, thank God,’ and then went out and went food shopping because we knew we had money coming in,” said Gina Shadis, 56, of Newton, N.J.Both she and her husband, Stephen, were laid off within the last 14 months from jobs they had held for more than a decade: she from a quality assurance manager position at an environmental testing lab, and he as foreman and senior master technician at an auto dealership. They are each receiving $548 a week in federal jobless benefits, or about a quarter of their pay at their most recent jobs.“It has just been such a traumatic time,” Ms. Shadis said. “You wake up in the morning with shoulders tense and head aching because you didn’t sleep the night before from worrying.”More than six million workers have exhausted their unemployment benefits since the recession began in December 2007, according to the National Employment Law Project, a labor advocacy group.Millions of workers are sitting on the sidelines and so are not counted in the tally of unemployed. Some are merely waiting for the job market to improve, and others are trying to invest in new skills to appeal to employers who are already hiring.“I have a few prospects who say they want me to work for them when I graduate,” said Jordan Douglas, a 24-year-old single mother in Pampa, Tex., who is enrolled in a special program that allows her to receive jobless benefits while attending school full time to become a registered nurse. She receives $792 in benefits every two weeks, a little less than half of what she earned in an administrative position at the nursing home that laid her off last year.Ms. Douglas calculates that her federal jobless benefits will run out the very last week of nursing school.“This had to have been a sign from God that I had to do this, since it all worked out so well,” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index closed at its highest level in five years on Friday after a report showed that hiring held up in December, giving stocks an early lift.The index finished up 7.10 points, at 1,466.47, its highest close since December 2007.The S.& P. 500 began its descent from a record close of 1,565.15 in October 2007, as the early signs of the financial crisis began to emerge. The index bottomed out at 676.53 in March 2009 before staging a recovery during which it has doubled in value and moved within 99 points of its peak.Despite a halting recovery in the United States economy, the index has climbed steadily as the Federal Reserve has provided huge support to the financial system, buying hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds and holding benchmark interest rates near zero. Last month, the Fed said it would keep rates low until the unemployment rate improved significantly.“Without the Federal Reserve doing what they did for the last few years, there would be no way you’d be near any of these levels in the index,” said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. “I would call this the Fed-levitating market.”The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.85 points, to 13,435.21. It gained 3.8 percent for the week, its biggest weekly advance since June. The Nasdaq closed at 3,101.66, up 1.09 points.Stocks surged this week after Congress passed a bill to avoid a combination of government spending cuts and tax increases that had come to be known as the fiscal cliff. The law, passed late Tuesday, averted that outcome, which could have pushed the economy back into recession.The Labor Department said on Friday that employers added 155,000 jobs in December, showing that hiring held up during the tense fiscal negotiations in Washington. It also said hiring was stronger in November than first thought. The unemployment rate was steady at 7.8 percent.The report did not give stocks more of a boost because the number of jobs created matched analysts’ forecasts, said J. J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade.“The jobs report couldn’t have been more in line,” Mr. Kinahan said. “The market had more to lose than to gain from it.”Among stocks making big moves, Eli Lilly & Company shares jumped $1.84, or 3.7 percent, to $51.56 after the company said its earnings would beat Wall Street forecasts, even though it will lose United States patent protection for two more product types this year.Stock in Walgreen, the nation’s largest drugstore chain, fell 61 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $37.18 after the company said that a measure of revenue fell more than analysts had expected in December, even as prescription counts continued to recover.Share prices may also be benefiting as investors adjust their portfolios to favor stocks over bonds, Mr. Kinahan said. A multiyear rally in bonds has pushed up prices for the securities and reduced the yields that they offer, in many cases to levels below company dividends.Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its view that stocks “can be an attractive source of income,” and warned that there was a risk that bonds might fall. In a note to clients, the bank said that an index of AAA-rated corporate bonds offered a yield of just 1.6 percent, less than the S.& P. 500’s dividend yield of 2.1 percent.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note fell 1/32, to 97 17/32, and the yield fell to 1.90 percent, from 1.91 percent late Thursday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/business/letters-income-taxes-and-math.html," Income, Taxes and MathTo the Editor:In “Bad Math and the Middle Class” (Economic View, Dec. 30), N. Gregory Mankiw says that tax and income data “suggest that the rich are not, as a general matter, shirking their responsibilities to support the federal government,” and that “the current tax system looks plenty progressive.”First, Mr. Mankiw never mentions that many taxes in our society — like sales and gasoline taxes — are regressive. Second, he sets the bar for tax fairness way too low. The growth of income inequality since the Reagan administration shows that Congress went too far in abolishing high-income tax brackets — a revenue source that we need if we are ever to pay for two wars lasting 11 years.A progressive tax system should maintain or reduce income inequality so that our society is more of a meritocracy than a plutocracy. Roger FriedmanDecatur, Ga., Dec. 30To the Editor:In the long run, most all Americans are likely to face higher taxes, thus broadening the base, but let’s remember that taxes haven’t solely been used for the purpose of raising revenue or reducing debt. The tax structure in America over the past 30 years has clearly been a major component of a sharp shift in the nation’s wealth.  Lowered tax rates on income and dramatically reduced rates on investment income have skewed the system in favor the already wealthy, and the implications will impact our national fiscal well-being for years to come. Kevin Kobalter, M.D.San Rafael, Calif., Dec. 30To the Editor:Lamenting the growth of the United States deficit, Professor Mankiw blames higher spending on entitlement programs like Medicare — spending that is  driven, he argues, by “new technology, which extends and improves the quality of life, but often at a high cost.”Such views are hard to stomach after reading “Finding Profits, at $28,000 a Vial” in your section the same day. That article described a company that paid $100,000 for the rights to a drug developed decades ago, increased the price of the drug overnight to $23,000 from $1,650 a vial (and now to more than $28,000), has manufacturing costs that account for only 1 percent of the drug’s price — and saw the drug’s sales total nearly $350 million in the first nine months of 2012.Rather than cut Medicare benefits, wouldn’t it make more sense to rein in sky-high prices for drugs?François FurstenbergMontreal, Dec. 30To the Editor:Professor Mankiw attributes much of America’s federal deficit to the growth in entitlement spending, but why doesn’t he mention the cost of the wars that the nation has waged?Policy makers have presumably known all along that the population would age and that health care costs would increase. Rather than factoring those truths into the budget, they chose to wage wars of choice. Is that the citizens’ fault? I don’t think so. Carol WheelerSan Miguel de Allende,Mexico, Dec. 30"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/opinion/sunday/google-wins-an-antitrust-battle.html,"Google scored a big victory last week when the Federal Trade Commission concluded that the company was not manipulating search results in ways that harmed consumers. But the agency’s finding does not completely settle the question of whether the company, which is used for more than 70 percent of all Internet searches in the United States, has abused its dominance. The European Commission and attorneys general in Texas, New York and other states who are also investigating Google could come to very different conclusions about that question.While reaching a settlement with Google on a handful of relatively modest issues, the F.T.C. has left unresolved the legitimate fears that Internet companies like Expedia and Yelp have about how Google uses its power to push into online businesses like travel bookings and restaurant reviews while pushing aside rivals.Even if that does not immediately leave users worse off, Google’s critics rightly argue that it could eventually result in fewer choices for consumers if worthy Internet services fail because Google actively makes it difficult for people to find them. Competitors of Google, including Microsoft, have argued that Google often displays search results to highlight its own products, like Google Maps, Google Flights and Google Shopping. They say that by doing so it is acting as Microsoft did in the 1990s when it forced PC makers to pre-install its Internet Explorer software with the Windows operating system at the expense of rivals like Netscape.But the F.T.C. did not buy that argument and concluded that Google had not harmed competition in the marketplace, even if it may have hurt individual rivals.Although Google dominates Internet search today, Web users have many options. And the company’s continued dominance is far from assured when it comes to the fast-growing world of smartphones and tablets, where many users download apps without relying on Google. But the company clearly stepped over the line with the practices it has agreed to change.Google will now be required to make it easier for competitors to license certain patents that it had previously agreed to provide. It will also change policies that make it hard for businesses to manage their advertising campaigns on Google and other search engines, and it will give Web sites the ability to opt out of having their content used to bolster its specialized services like Google Local.Fifteen years ago, few people predicted that Microsoft’s commanding position would be undercut so drastically by the rise of Google, Apple and others. History, however, is not necessarily prologue to the future. Antitrust regulators must remain watchful that Google does not abuse its dominant position in ways that unfairly limit consumer choices and competition."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/jobs/delphi-automotives-ceo-on-detours-and-opportunity.html,"IN the late 1940s, my parents migrated from the South to the North, seeking opportunity. That word, opportunity, has been a shaper of my life.My family lived through the civil rights era, in which many Americans tried to right the wrongs of social injustice. My parents believed that things would change for minorities and that there would be opportunity for those who were ready. They stressed that my siblings and I get ready, through education.As a child in Ohio, I delivered The Dayton Daily News. At 13, I was named newspaper delivery boy of the year; my picture was on the front page. I later worked in the circulation department until I left for college.When I was a senior in high school, the General Motors Institute, now Kettering University, was diversifying. My counselor recommended that I attend G.M.I., but I told her I was interested in studying computer science at Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. My counselor went so far as to fill out a G.M.I. application and slip it into my locker. I signed it and sent it in just to have her leave me alone. Soon after, G.M.I. sent me an acceptance letter. Attending G.M.I. worked out well because I didn’t know how I would pay for Miami, and the institute had a cooperative program in which I attended classes for six weeks, then worked for six weeks.After graduating in 1976, I worked at G.M. as a production engineer, making steering wheels. A year later, I became a front line supervisor. I loved the manufacturing floor and learning about different operations. A majority of my crew were women, who helped me learn the job. I learned that people want to help one another. You’re responsible for a job, but you can’t do it alone.One of my later assignments as production manager was to help turn around a G.M. operation in Portugal. It was a chance to make a difference and I seized it, yet I recall thinking as the plane took off for Lisbon, “What have I done?” But I loved the assignment. My family and I traveled extensively in Europe in the three years I was there.After returning from Portugal in 1987, I accepted my first executive assignment, as general superintendent of manufacturing in Canada. In 1991, I attended a Sloan executive program at Stanford for a master of science in management degree.In 1997, G.M. appointed me as vice president and general manager of Delphi interior and safety systems, a division of Delphi Automotive Systems, its parts maker. Two years later it spun off Delphi.When my colleagues and I were contemplating whether to move to the new company, I said, “Let’s go for it.” I’ve always loved a good journey. I was promoted twice more before becoming president and chief operating officer in 2005. . That was the same year we filed for Chapter 11 reorganization because our performance was continuing to deteriorate. We needed to preserve the value of the company before it deteriorated any further.In 2007, I was named Delphi’s C.E.O. and remained president as well.The reorganization was one of the largest in the nation’s industrial history. We focused our portfolio on 33 core product lines, down from 131, and emerged from bankruptcy in 2009 as a leaner, more product-focused, high-tech company. We had taken a formerly unprofitable subsidiary, geared to one North American customer, and made it a diversified growth company with over 100,000 employees in over 30 countries.Even though I’ve been at G.M. and Delphi my entire career, it feels as if I’ve been at several companies because I’ve worked in so many areas. My career is an example of taking advantage of opportunities when they come along.In November 2011, I rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange to mark Delphi’s initial public offering. I remember standing there thinking that we had seized our opportunity."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/your-money/a-stock-market-winning-streak-has-drawn-few-cheers.html,"ON May 30, 1982, Cal Ripken Jr. played a solid game in the infield for the Baltimore Orioles. He did it again the next game and the game after that and the next game, too. Ripken didn’t miss a game for 16 years.At first, no one noticed his perfect attendance record. But thanks to the obsessive data crunching of baseball statisticians, people eventually began to celebrate. That unbroken string of games turned into the Streak — 2,632 consecutive games, a run of lunchbox heroism that shattered the seemingly unbreakable, 2,130-game record of Lou Gehrig, the fabled Iron Horse of the Yankees.Baseball’s legions of statisticians have made it easy to track Ripken’s achievements — as well as those that are far more obscure. (Who held the Orioles’ club record for most consecutive games until Ripken broke it on May 4, 1985? Does anyone care? No matter, it’s in the books: Brooks Robinson, another superstar infielder, with 463 games.)Making money is, arguably, the true national pastime of the United States. While the financial game isn’t always analyzed with quite the same élan as baseball, Paul T. Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, has unearthed a noteworthy financial streak — one that is still under most people’s radar.Each day in 2012, as well as in these early days of 2013, he says, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index has closed in positive territory for the calendar year. Here’s another way of putting it: In 2012, the index never had a daily close below the closing level for 2011. And despite endless worries about the so-called fiscal cliff, the streak lives on.How unusual is this?“Going back to 1928, there have only been eight other years where the index went an entire year of trading up year-to-date every single day,” Mr. Hickey says. The last time was in 1979.The odds that the current streak will be sustained through a second calendar year are quite low. Since 1928, it’s happened only once — in 1975 and 1976, a period not remembered as being particularly strong for equities.Today, many people don’t see the market as worth the bother, either. “Although the current bull market is approaching four years in duration, if you talk to the average investor, many will not even call it a bull market,” Bespoke wrote last week in its annual report on the markets. “In 2012, the S.& P. 500 was up by more than 10 percent, but if you asked most casual observers how the market was doing, they would probably tell you that it was flat, or maybe even down.”That may help explain why the current streak hasn’t received more attention, Mr. Hickey said in an interview. Cogitating about it may induce cognitive dissonance, because the streak attests to the market’s consistently strong performance while many wise commentators have been stressing the market’s uncertainty and turbulence.“The numbers don’t lie,’ Mr. Hickey said. “We’ve been having a bull market streak when many people don’t even realize we’re in a bull market.”The reasons for the market’s persistent buoyancy may not be appealing, Mr. Hickey said. It’s possible that stocks have performed well primarily because of the expansive monetary policy of central banks and because of governments’ heightened intervention in the financial system and the economy.“But whatever the reasons,” he said, “if you bought stocks in March 2009 at the bottom of the market, you can sell them today at a tremendous premium.”In fact, a $1,000 investment in an S.& P. 500 index fund made in March 2009 would be worth more than $2,000 today.Yet many investors are “disconnected from the stock market these days and that’s understandable,” Mr. Hickey said, given the enormous losses suffered in the financial crisis and in the collapse of the Internet bubble less than a decade before that.The current rally may still have legs precisely because many investors have so far failed to participate in it. They may become reaccustomed to the idea that stocks can be very profitable, he said.Crunch the numbers for the last year or so and you’ll see that active investors actually “have been risk-on, not risk-off,” he said. Last year, growth stocks generally fared better than the traditionally safe dividend payers, he observed. And stocks of companies that derive a high proportion of their revenue from the domestic market generally outperformed foreign stocks. They also fared better than domestic stocks with high international exposure.In short, the bull market that started in March 2009 remains very much intact, he said.You might not know that from financial headlines that have often focused on weakness in the economy and on the myriad crises in Europe, the Middle East and Washington.In fact, many sentiment indicators suggest that investors remain quite worried, and that the market’s rise last week may have simply been a world-didn’t-end rally, a collective sigh of relief.On Monday, the last day of 2012, there were rumors of a breakthrough in the impasse in Washington, and the S.& P. 500 rose 1.7 percent, its best year-ending day since 1974.On Wednesday, the market soared 2 percent on news that the so-called fiscal cliff had been dodged in a last-minute deal. That built a cushion for the rest of the week. Stocks wavered on Thursday and rose on Friday — finishing 2.8 percent above their closing level for 2012.STILL, the market’s perch is precarious, in the view of many strategists. Will Geisdorf, senior global analyst at Ned Davis Research, for example, said last week that while the bull market was intact, a short-term correction was very likely, if only because the market had risen so rapidly.“We have a cautious view for the next four or five weeks,” he said, though the medium-term outlook is “decidedly bullish.”The deal reached in Washington created a new series of seemingly crucial deadlines in March. That’s when the federal government is expected to hit its debt ceiling, when its spending authorization bill will need approval, and when cuts in domestic and military spending will begin if no action is taken. The market turbulence may well be disconcerting.But for now, the streak lives on. Perhaps it’s time to take a little notice."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/science/earth/in-fields-and-markets-guatemalans-feel-squeeze-of-biofuel-demand.html,"GUATEMALA CITY — In the tiny tortillerias of this city, people complain ceaselessly about the high price of corn. Just three years ago, one quetzal — about 15 cents — bought eight tortillas; today it buys only four. And eggs have tripled in price because chickens eat corn feed.Meanwhile, in rural areas, subsistence farmers struggle to find a place to sow their seeds. On a recent morning, José Antonio Alvarado was harvesting his corn crop on the narrow median of Highway 2 as trucks zoomed by.“We’re farming here because there is no other land, and I have to feed my family,” said Mr. Alvarado, pointing to his sons Alejandro and José, who are 4 and 6 but appear to be much younger, a sign of chronic malnutrition.Recent laws in the United States and Europe that mandate the increasing use of biofuel in cars have had far-flung ripple effects, economists say, as land once devoted to growing food for humans is now sometimes more profitably used for churning out vehicle fuel.In a globalized world, the expansion of the biofuels industry has contributed to spikes in food prices and a shortage of land for food-based agriculture in poor corners of Asia, Africa and Latin America because the raw material is grown wherever it is cheapest.Nowhere, perhaps, is that squeeze more obvious than in Guatemala, which is “getting hit from both sides of the Atlantic,” in its fields and at its markets, said Timothy Wise, a Tufts University development expert who is studying the problem globally with Actionaid, a policy group based in Washington that focuses on poverty.With its corn-based diet and proximity to the United States, Central America has long been vulnerable to economic riptides related to the United States’ corn policy. Now that the United States is using 40 percent of its crop to make biofuel, it is not surprising that tortilla prices have doubled in Guatemala, which imports nearly half of its corn.At the same time, Guatemala’s lush land, owned by a handful of families, has proved ideal for producing raw materials for biofuels. Suchitepéquez Province, a major corn-producing region five years ago, is now carpeted with sugar cane and African palm. The field Mr. Alvarado used to rent for his personal corn crop now grows sugar cane for a company that exports bioethanol to Europe.In a country where most families must spend about two thirds of their income on food, “the average Guatemalan is now hungrier because of biofuel development,” said Katja Winkler, a researcher at Idear, a Guatemalan nonprofit organization that studies rural issues. Roughly 50 percent of the nation’s children are chronically malnourished, the fourth-highest rate in the world, according to the United Nations.The American renewable fuel standard mandates that an increasing volume of biofuel be blended into the nation’s vehicle fuel supply each year to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and to bolster the nation’s energy security. Similarly, by 2020, transportation fuels in Europe will have to contain 10 percent biofuel.Large companies like Pantaleon Sugar Holdings, Guatemala’s leading sugar producer, are profiting from that new demand, with recent annual growth of more than 30 percent. The Inter-American Development Bank says the new industry could bring an infusion of cash and jobs to Guatemala’s rural economy if developed properly. For now, the sugar industry directly provides 60,000 jobs and the palm industry 17,000, although the plantations are not labor-intensive.But many worry that Guatemala’s poor are already suffering from the diversion of food to fuel. “There are pros and cons to biofuel, but not here,” said Misael Gonzáles of C.U.C., a labor union for Guatemala’s farmers. “These people don’t have enough to eat. They need food. They need land. They can’t eat biofuel, and they don’t drive cars.”In 2011, corn prices would have been 17 percent lower if the United States did not subsidize and give incentives for biofuel production with its renewable fuel policies, according to an analysis by Bruce A. Babcock, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. The World Bank has suggested that biofuel mandates in the developed world should be adjusted when food is short or prices are inordinately high.Concerned about the effects of its biofuel mandate on world hunger, the European Commission recently proposed amending its policy so that only half of its 2020 target could be met by using biofuels made from food crops or those grown on land previously devoted to food crops.The current American mandate, established in 2007 by Congress, can be waived by the Environmental Protection Agency, but, according to law, such adjustments focus on domestic issues like cases in which biofuel “requirements would severely harm the economy of a state, a region or the United States,” the agency said in an e-mail when asked for comment.Once nearly self-sufficient in corn production, Guatemala became more dependent on imports in the 1990s as a surplus of subsidized American corn flowed south. Guatemalan farmers could not compete, and corn production dropped roughly 30 percent per capita from 1995 to 2005, Mr. Wise said.But cheap imports disappeared once the United States started using corn to fulfill its 2007 biofuels standards. “The use of maize to make biofuel has led to these crazy prices,” said Guy Gauvreau, head of the United Nations World Food Program in Guatemala. It “is not ethically acceptable,” he added.In part because the agency’s primary food supplement is a mix of corn and soy, it cannot afford to help all of the Guatemalan children in need, Mr. Gauvreau said; it is agency policy to buy corn locally, but there is no extra corn grown here anymore. And Guatemalans cannot go back to the land because so much of it is being devoted to growing crops for biofuel. (Almost no biofuel is used domestically.)The southwestern village of La Ayuda is now an island of rickety dwellings in the middle of a giant African palm plantation. Félix Pérez, 51, used to grow corn, beans and fruit behind his home. He now walks about three miles to a cheap hillside plot that he rents for four months of the year. “Every day it’s more difficult to survive since we live off the land, and there’s less and less,” he said.Although African palm was practically nonexistent in Guatemala two decades ago, palm oil is now the country’s third-largest export, after sugar and bananas, with exports rising by more than a third in 2011, according to United Nations trade statistics.Although Susana Siekavizza, executive director of Grepalma, the local industry association, said that Guatemalan palm is currently exported for cooking oil, the high prices that it commands reflect heightened global demand for a crop also used in biofuel. It is exported in a raw form that can be distilled into biofuel in the receiving country, and Ms. Siekavizza said there was “interest” in manufacturing fuel in Guatemala.Production of sugar cane, long a mainstay Guatemalan crop, has also skyrocketed as biofuels opened new market opportunities. Pantaleon Sugar Holdings, which once exported only food products, now uses 13 percent of its production for fuel. Local sugar prices have doubled.For Guatemala’s largest landowners, long-term leases with large biofuel companies are more profitable and easier to manage than cattle ranching or renting to subsistence farmers.In small towns like San Basilio, representatives of one palm company are pressing farmers to lease their fields.“I’m trying not to because I need that land to grow corn,” said one farmer, Gilberto Galindo Morales, 46. But he added that farming has become difficult as nearby plantations divert and deplete rivers to feed industrial-scale irrigation systems. Ash from burning cane fields after harvest also damages his corn crop and irritates his children’s lungs, he said.With sometimes violent confrontations over land and labor, plantation gates are secured with armed guards. Still, Ms. Siekavizza of the trade group contends that the belief that palm cultivation is robbing people of food is “more myth than reality” since much of Guatemala’s terrain and soil composition “is not well suited to growing corn.”In the remote Mayan villages in the north of the country, the incursion of plantations has brought a few good jobs and some training, but many complain of low wages and the backbreaking nature of the work, which mostly involves picking the small red fruits from African palm trees or off the ground. “We sold our land, so now we have to work, but I think it’s better when you grow your own,” said Juana Paula Tec Choc in the village of El Cancellero. “At least then you have some security.”A report last year by the United States Department of Agriculture noted Guatemala’s potential for biofuel production, saying that palm plantations tended to be on “underutilized” agricultural land and applied no dangerous pesticides to the trees; that assessment could be important for getting palm-based fuel approved for use in the United States.But villagers in El Cancellero disputed that, saying they suspected chemical poisoning was behind the mysterious deaths of four young children last year. On a recent afternoon, a crop duster buzzed overhead, and workers wearing tanks fitted with spray hoses trudged along a narrow road that separates what remains of the village from endless rows of squat palms."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/business/crowdfunding-for-small-business-is-still-an-unclear-path.html,"RYAN CALDBECK was stumped. A director at a private equity firm, he was taking part in a panel discussion at a consumer goods conference last summer in New York when an entrepreneur raised his hand with a question: Where could a young company with just a few million dollars in sales go for money to grow?Mr. Caldbeck and his peers on the panel fumbled for a response. The fact is, most private equity investors and venture capitalists won’t touch a consumer products company until it has surpassed $10 million in sales — anything else is too small to bother with.The best advice the panel could offer was for the entrepreneur to tap his credit cards.“The purpose of the panel was to help entrepreneurs raise money, but we had no answers,” Mr. Caldbeck remembers. “That’s when I knew that there is a big issue here.”That big issue caused Mr. Caldbeck to leave his job to start CircleUp, a company that aims to connect up-and-coming consumer products companies with investors.Right now, the people allowed to invest through CircleUp must be accredited, meaning they have a high net worth. CircleUp hopes that soon not just the wealthy few, but the general public — whether friends, family members, customers, Facebook friends, or even total strangers — will be able to invest in deserving companies through a hot new area of finance known as crowdfunding.To its advocates, crowdfunding is a way for capital-starved entrepreneurs to receive financing that neither big investors nor lenders are willing or able to provide. To others, it represents a potential minefield that could help bad businesses get off the ground before they eventually fail, and in some cases could even ensnare unsophisticated investors in outright fraud.Those fears are partly why the Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed rules allowing crowdfunding that were supposed to take effect this month as part of the JOBS Act (Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups), signed by President Obama last April. The S.E.C. is wary of loosening investor protections that have been in place since the 1930s.Despite the uncertainty, the outlines of a new industry are emerging as a few crowdfunding start-ups have found ways to raise money within current rules. They include companies like CircleUp and SoMoLend, which lends money to small, Main Street-type businesses that typically wouldn’t interest private investors.By themselves, of course, a few start-ups can’t completely democratize finance. But they begin to illuminate what the future of crowdfunding could look like, as the debate continues over a vast widening of the private investor pool.Mr. Caldbeck formed CircleUp last fall along with Rory Eakin, a former business school classmate who was working for a philanthropic foundation. Through their start-up, the two men seek to finance food, personal care, apparel and pet-related companies, often with an environmental or social bent.CircleUp considers applications from companies with $1 million to $10 million in revenue. Companies whose applications are accepted make their pitches to investors behind a firewall on the CircleUp Web site, offering equity stakes in return for capital. CircleUp, which helps companies raise up to $3 million, takes a small cut of the money.Under current federal regulations, CircleUp wouldn’t be able to arrange such deals on its own. But it struck a partnership with W. R. Hambrecht, a registered broker-dealer that can handle investments from accredited, or high-net-worth, individuals whom the S.E.C. considers sophisticated enough to invest in private companies.“Living here in Silicon Valley, a lot of people don’t understand the need,” Mr. Caldbeck says. “If you’re a tech company with a good idea, you can raise money. But it’s a different story for food, agriculture, retail and other consumer-oriented businesses.”Mr. Caldbeck sees a big opportunity. Consumer goods companies account for a sizable portion of the nation’s businesses, yet very little capital — from private equity funds or from accredited investors — flows to them, he says.What’s more, only a tiny percentage of those who qualify as accredited investors actually invest in private companies, he says. (These are people with a net worth of at least $1 million, not including their primary residence, or who have earned more than $200,000 — $300,000 for couples — in each of the last two years.)CircleUp is aiming to simplify the process so that more accredited investors take the plunge and more start-ups can get financing. And it wants to expand its business to unaccredited investors when the rules for crowdfunding are completed.So far, CircleUp has helped seven companies raise money on its site. They include Episencial, a children’s organic skin care line based in Los Angeles; Laloo’s, a maker of goat milk ice cream in Petaluma, Calif.; and Little Duck Organics, a children’s snack producer in Brooklyn.Zak Normandin, 26, the tousled-haired founder of Little Duck Organics, got the money to start his business the way many small businesses do: by maxing out credit cards. He ran the company out of his basement and distributed products himself to local stores before winning his first big client: Whole Foods.Two years later, he and nine employees operate out of offices in a brick warehouse in the Greenpoint area of Brooklyn. His goal has been to create healthy snacks and cereals that he would serve to his own three children.“There’s no healthy fun alternative for kids,” Mr. Normandin says.The company’s first product — Tiny Fruits, a line of no-sugar-added organic fruit snacks — can be found in 6,000 retail outlets, including Whole Foods and Stop & Shop stores and on Amazon.com. Mighty Oats, a new cereal line packaged in compostable containers, will hit stores this month. There are juices, fruit purées and other products in the works, he says.All of that takes capital — lots of it. Yet fund-raising takes valuable time away from running the business.CircleUp has given entrepreneurs like Mr. Normandin a streamlined way to raise money while providing investors with opportunities they may not otherwise hear about. In seven weeks, Little Duck raised nearly $900,000 from about a dozen investors on the site.“Pre-CircleUp, 80 percent of my time during fund-raising was spent with investors,” Mr. Normandin says.And the CircleUp fund-raising brought more than money. A few investors with experience in building and marketing consumer brands have become informal advisers to Mr. Normandin. “To have that kind of experience to leverage has been extremely helpful,” he says.Another draw is that CircleUp has partnered with corporations like General Mills, which get an early look at new brands they might want to acquire down the road.CircleUp itself has attracted $1.5 million from big-name investors including Howard Schultz, the Starbucks chairman, through his Maveron venture fund.Another supporter is Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor known for his work on what is called disruptive innovation; he invested in CircleUp through his Rose Park Advisors investment firm. (Professor Christensen says that seemingly simple innovations can disrupt and displace mainstays in a market the way the personal computer disrupted the mainframe market and smartphones are now disrupting PCs.)CircleUp, and crowdfunding in general, have “the potential to be disruptive,” Professor Christensen says, by opening up financing to companies that have traditionally struggled to raise capital and to investors who have been excluded from the market.SOMOLEND, a crowdfunding start-up based in Cincinnati with offices in New York City, is focused on a more modest, but ultimately larger, market: the millions of small businesses that dot the nation’s Main Streets.These businesses usually rely on financing from friends and family, home equity loans, credit cards and bank loans. Yet all of those financing sources suffered greatly during the financial crisis and in many cases have not yet recovered. While overall commercial lending has rebounded, bank lending to small businesses is still down significantly from 2008.Much of the crowdfunding focus has been on equity — selling shares in start-ups — but SoMoLend is betting that loans to expanding small businesses are a bigger opportunity. Equity crowdfunding will be “minuscule compared to the impact crowdfunding will have on debt financing,” says Candace Klein, SoMoLend’s founder and C.E.O. “We think this is literally going to change the banking system.”Citing a recent Federal Reserve report, Ms. Klein says that nearly a third of small businesses don’t apply for bank loans for fear of rejection. Of those that do apply, two-thirds are turned down, leaving them in need of capital.That is the market that SoMoLend — short for Social Mobile Local Lending — was created to serve. Ms. Klein’s experience with her first start-up, a Cincinnati-based firm that mentors and makes microloans to entrepreneurial women, made her clearly aware of the need, she said. But how to serve that market as crowdfunding worked its way through the legislative — and now the regulatory — process? Ms. Klein had an idea: instead of raising money from a group of individual investors, she would seek out institutions to serve as lenders.Her first partner was KeyBank, a regional bank based in Cleveland, which helped test the site and develop an underwriting algorithm. Today, SoMoLend counts more than 40 institutions among its lenders, including Fifth Third Bank, the Emery Federal Credit Union, the Bank of Kentucky and Justine Petersen, a nonprofit microlender.Ms. Klein says she offers an efficient way for lenders to find loan candidates and to team up so they can reduce their risk.With SoMoLend, “we can query and filter the types of businesses we’re interested in” and “only take on the risk that we are comfortable with,” says Britt Scearce, a business development officer at Emery. In addition, local governments like the City of Cincinnati and St. Louis County, Mo., have signed on, seeing the service as a way to spur economic development.Since SoMoLend started about a year ago, it has eased the way for $3.4 million in loans to 89 small-business borrowers, typically retailers, restaurants, salons and other concerns that have inventory and equipment that can be used as collateral.Borrowers have included Candice Peters, who raised $9,000 from three lenders to help with working capital for her two-year-old Hyde Park Body Boutique, a workout studio in the Hyde Park section of Cincinnati. She now employs six instructors and says she hopes to open a second studio in another part of town.And there’s Stacey Shiring, owner of Creative Invites and Events, a Cincinnati shop that creates custom stationery and invitations from designs by local artists.Ms. Shiring, who is 34, obtained a $15,000 loan, at 6 percent interest, from Key Bank through SoMoLend. She used the loan to develop software that will allow customers to design stationery online; she plans to license the software to other stationers. As she began building a history of loan repayment on SoMoLend, she was able to secure a $50,000 line of credit from her bank.Ms. Shiring says her business is profitable, and she now employs five full-time and two part-time employees. “It’s hard to open a small business, and SoMoLend has made it a little easier for us,” she says.Crowdfunding sites like SoMoLend aim to act as a kind of financial launching pad. “Crowdfunding can get companies started to the point where they can get bank financing down the road,” says Mr. Scearce of Emery Credit Union. “We’re excited about what this can do for the economy — it can get a lot of companies up and running. And we’re excited to be in on the ground floor.”In October, Ms. Klein formed a partnership with Gate Global Impact, a broker-dealer based in New York, that allows SoMoLend to add accredited investors, as well as family members and friends, to its mix of lenders. That paves the way for what she calls “leveraged loans,” so that institutional lenders can feel more confident knowing that a borrower who has raised money from friends and family has some “skin in the game.” It also moves her closer to her goal of enabling ordinary investors to “invest in the products, people and companies that they already know and love.”HER hope is shared by dozens of other start-ups that geared up after President Obama signed the JOBS Act. One of the law’s crucial provisions allows private companies to sell shares to the public over the Internet, but it stipulates that such investments take place on a new type of Web site known as a “funding portal.” The S.E.C. was given until the end of 2012 to flesh out the legislation with detailed rules.Thus, last spring, the race to reinvent finance for the Internet age was on. With their eye on early 2013, dozens of ambitious start-ups began preparing their crowdfunding portals. They watched the stunning success of sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which have helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, and they vowed to do the same for entrepreneurs. (Donation- and rewards-based crowdfunding is not covered by securities laws, which kick in only when a financial return is promised.)Those dreams have been stalled, if not exactly extinguished. The S.E.C., sensitive to critics of the new law, has missed its year-end deadline. Turnover at the top of the agency — Mary L. Schapiro left as chairwoman in December, and a permanent replacement has not been named — could further slow progress.Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the S.E.C., wrote in an e-mail that the agency had been working very hard on crowdfunding rules and had said both before and after the JOBS Act was enacted that the year-end deadline was unrealistic for such a complex issue.“We will continue working hard amid a busy rule-making agenda to get these crowdfunding rules done as soon as possible and to get them done right — with the appropriate investor protections in place,” he said.Crowdfunding portals, meanwhile, are recalibrating their business plans as they operate in a holding pattern. Many people estimate that actual crowdfunding might not occur until early 2014.For crowdfunding entrepreneurs, “it’s going to be a long, cold winter and spring,” says D. J. Paul, a former securities professional who was a co-founder of a portal called Crowdfunder and now advises others.As the S.E.C. struggles to balance protection for investors with increased access to capital for small businesses, some advocates of crowdfunding worry that the idea’s promise will be stifled.Slava Rubin, the C.E.O. of Indiegogo, says, “I’m very concerned about the idea of the government stopping this before it has ever had the chance to get off its feet.”Mr. Rubin, whose company is considering expanding into investment-style crowdfunding once the new rules are completed, says he fears that regulations will be so complex that crowdfunding — at least as envisioned — “will be too burdensome to execute.”In part, the delay reflects the fact that crowdfunding poses risks. Small businesses and start-ups, after all, have a high failure rate. Even advocates concede that there will almost certainly be examples of fraud and failure when crowdfunding takes hold.“No one should expect that it will be flawless,” Mr. Rubin says. “As the saying goes, you’ve got to break some eggs to make an omelet.”Thom Ruhe, vice president for entrepreneurship at the Kauffman Foundation, says: “I’m absolutely certain there will be fraud in the crowdfunding space — it’s just too attractive for people with nefarious intent, which is why I hope the S.E.C. is taking all this time to get it right.” He favors prominent investor warnings on crowdfunding sites and an emphasis on investor education.“My biggest concern is when, not if, these fraudulent actions are discovered, that there won’t be an overreaction,” he says. He offers this analogy: If a bank is robbed in Chicago, you don’t shut down banks everywhere.Over all, he says, crowdfunding will broaden the pool of capital available to entrepreneurs and bolster the economy. “The movement behind crowdfunding is a market response to a market reality,” says Mr. Ruhe, referring to the financial crisis, which caused banks to rein in lending and to deny lines of credit to many healthy small companies.THE JOBS Act contains investor protections. For example, legislators capped the amount that unaccredited investors can invest through crowdfunding in a given year to $2,000, or 5 percent of their income, whichever is greater. Also, businesses that raise money on crowdfunding portals must disclose relevant financial information; for companies seeking more than $500,000, that includes audited figures.Creators of the new Web portals, meanwhile, have been offering crowdfunding conferences and boot camps, holding business-plan competitions and hosting fund-raising campaigns that allow companies to solicit donations but not investments. Others are re-evaluating whether they want to be involved in what may ultimately be a highly regulated industry.One high-profile entrepreneur, Adam Draper, has already thrown in the towel. His start-up, BoostFunder, had planned to create an online marketplace for start-ups and investors when he introduced it last year. But, citing regulatory red tape, Mr. Draper shifted gears and turned BoostFunder into a conventional Silicon Valley incubator.Mr. Eakin of CircleUp continues to work with accredited investors as the S.E.C. completes its work on crowdfunding. “We’re still optimistic about the potential for crowdfunding writ large,” he says. “It’s been a longer process than many of us had hoped, but one that in the end we think will be a good thing for the country over all.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/us/politics/obama-and-gop-gear-up-for-next-fiscal-fight.html,"WASHINGTON — In dueling weekly addresses, the White House and Republicans drew lines in the sand for their next fiscal showdown, which could be as soon as next month, when a Congressional fight is expected on raising the nation’s borrowing limit.Democrats have warned Republican leaders not to use the debt authorization for political leverage. In his weekly address, President Obama again said he would not trade spending cuts for an increase in the debt limit.“One thing I will not compromise over is whether or not Congress should pay the tab for a bill they’ve already racked up,” he said. “If Congress refuses to give the United States the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic.”Mr. Obama also repeated his new demand that future spending cuts be met with commensurate tax increases. “Spending cuts must be balanced with more reforms to our tax code,” he said. “The wealthiest individuals and the biggest corporations shouldn’t be able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren’t available to most Americans.”A similar standoff over raising the debt limit in 2011 led Standard & Poor’s for the first time to downgrade its rating of United States Treasury debt by one notch, suggesting a higher risk of default. The impasse caused a slump in the market, and analysts fear that another one could cause yet more damage.Many Republicans have said they do not plan to lift the country’s statutory borrowing limit unless Democrats agree to significant spending cuts, particularly to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.In the Republican address, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, argued that Congress needed to focus on cutting spending and simplifying the tax code.“Many of our Democrat colleagues just don’t seem to get it,” he said. “Throughout the fiscal cliff discussions, the president and the Democrats who control Washington repeatedly refused to take any meaningful steps to make Washington live within its means. That position is irresponsible and fails to acknowledge what every family in America already knows: when you have no more money in your account and your credit cards are maxed out, then the spending must stop.”Just after the new year, Congress agreed to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and delay for two months significant cuts to the discretionary budget, brokering the deal to avoid the worst of the tax increases and spending cuts known collectively as the “fiscal cliff.” But the deal, which will cut the deficit by an estimated $650 billion over 10 years, is far smaller than the trillions of dollars in deficit reduction initially sought by negotiators.It also left several issues for the 113th Congress to resolve, including raising the debt ceiling, trying to defuse some of the mandated discretionary-spending cuts and averting a government shutdown. Those will come to a head in February and March. If Congress fails to lift the ceiling, a cash management crisis will result, as the Treasury will lack the money to pay all the country’s bills on time."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/business/bank-settlement-may-leave-tiny-slices-of-a-smaller-pie.html,"IF you were hoping that things might be different in 2013 — you know, that bankers would be held responsible for bad behavior or that the government might actually assist troubled homeowners — you can forget it. A settlement reportedly in the works with big banks will soon end a review into foreclosure abuses, and it means more of the same: no accountability for financial institutions and little help for borrowers.Last week, The New York Times reported that regulators were close to settling with 14 banks whose foreclosure practices had ridden roughshod over borrowers and the rule of law. Although the deal has not been made official and its terms are as yet unknown, the initial report said borrowers who had lost their homes because of improprieties would receive a total of $3.75 billion in cash. An additional $6.25 billion would be put toward principal reduction for homeowners in distress.The possible settlement will conclude a regulatory enforcement action brought in 2011 by the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve. Regulators moved against 14 large home loan servicers after evidence emerged of rampant misdeeds marring the foreclosure process.Under the enforcement action, the banks were required to review foreclosures conducted in 2009 and 2010. They hired consultants to analyze cases in which borrowers suspected that they had been injured by bank practices, such as levying excessive and improper fees or foreclosing when a borrower was undergoing a loan modification. Some 4.4 million borrowers journeyed through the foreclosure maze during the period.Some back-of-the-envelope arithmetic on this deal is your first clue that it is another gift to the banks. It’s not clear which borrowers will receive what money, but divvying up $3.75 billion among millions of people doesn’t amount to much per person. If, say, half of the 4.4 million borrowers were subject to foreclosure abuses, they would each receive less than $2,000, on average. If 10 percent of the 4.4 million were harmed, each would get roughly $8,500.This is a far cry from the possible penalties outlined last year by the federal regulators requiring these reviews. For instance, regulators said that if a bank had foreclosed while a borrower was making payments under a loan modification, it might have to pay $15,000 and rescind the foreclosure. And if it couldn’t be rescinded because the house had been sold, the bank could have had to pay the borrower $125,000 and any accrued equity.Recall that the foreclosure exams came about because regulators had found pervasive problems. A study by the Fed and the comptroller’s office found “critical weaknesses in servicers’ foreclosure governance processes, foreclosure document preparation processes, and oversight and monitoring of third-party vendors, including foreclosure attorneys.” The United States Trustee, which oversees the nation’s bankruptcy courts, also uncovered huge flaws in bank practices.So if you start to hear rumbling that the reviews didn’t turn up many misdeeds, you can discount it as nonsense. One could easily argue that this reported settlement was pushed by the banks so they could limit the damage they would have incurred if an aggressive review had continued.“We think if the reviews were done right, the payouts would have been significantly higher than they appear to be under this settlement,” said Alys Cohen, staff attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. “The regulators will have abdicated their responsibility if the banks end up getting off the hook easily and cheaply.”Let’s not forget that this looming settlement will also conclude the foreclosure reviews that were supposed to provide regulators with chapter and verse on how banks abused their customers. Stopping the reviews before they are finished means that the banks will be allowed to claim that abuses were rare and that $10 billion is an adequate penalty.A spokesman at the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency declined to comment on whether a settlement was imminent or what it might look like. But with no clear details about its terms, many questions remain. First, of course, is how many borrowers will receive the $3.75 billion, and how will that money be shared? And who will ensure that the funds go to the right people? The fact is, most people will not be hiring a lawyer to pursue their cases further against servicers, so this money is all that they will receive.Another problem is that the money will be doled out to wronged borrowers based on work done by consultants hired by the banks responsible for the improprieties. How can their findings be trusted? What’s more, the reviews’ conclusions about harm are based on the servicers’ side of the story, not homeowners’.Because the consultants work for the banks, it is also possible that these institutions may use the information gleaned from the foreclosure reviews to profit once again on troubled borrowers. If foreclosed borrowers left a property while owing the difference between the amount of the loan and what the bank received in a sale of the home, the bank may not have known the borrowers’ whereabouts until that information was reported in a request for review.Finally, what if victims of an improper foreclosure didn’t receive a review because they didn’t know about the program? Letters about the program sent to 5.3 percent of targeted borrowers were returned as undeliverable, regulators said.And many of those who did receive the mailings may not have understood them. In a study last June, the Government Accountability Office concluded that the initial letter, the request-for-review form and foreclosure review Web site were “written above the average reading level of the U.S. population.” What’s more, the study said, the materials did not include specifics about what borrowers might receive as a remedy, possibly affecting their motivation to respond.In any case, as of Dec. 6, 2012, only 322,771 borrowers had requested an independent review, according to the Fed. That’s 7.3 percent of the affected borrowers during the period, a figure that does not mirror the widespread problems regulators said they had identified in the foreclosure system.“The O.C.C.-Fed review is just another flawed outreach program designed to fail,” said Ned Brown, a legislative strategist at the marketing consultant Prairie Strategies in Washington. “The servicers rolled the regulators.”New year, same story."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/world/europe/greece-tax-scandal-shifts-focus-from-collection-problem.html,"The tax scandal that reignited in Greece over the holidays had all the makings of a grade-B drama. A former finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, was accused of scrubbing his relatives’ names from a CD containing the identities of thousands of possible Greek tax dodgers. Within hours, his chief political rival tossed him from their party.Mr. Papaconstantinou, in turn, hinted darkly that he was the victim of a plot masking malfeasance at higher levels.While the firestorm may have made for political theater of a sort, it has diverted attention from a much bigger problem: Greece, its foreign lenders say, has fallen woefully short of its tax collection targets and is still not moving hard enough to tackle widespread tax evasion — long tolerated, particularly among the country’s richest citizens.Greek officials agreed to the targets as part of an international lending pact last year, but there is no penalty for missing them. In recent weeks, however, two reports by Greece’s foreign lenders have found that Athens pulled in less than half of the additional tax income that it expected last year and performed fewer than half of the expected audits.One report said that Athens had brought in a little less than $1.3 billion in additional taxes of the $2.6 billion it had hoped to collect in 2012. Only 88 major taxpayers, including corporations, were the subject of full-scope audits, well below a target of 300, the report said, while just 467 audits of high-wealth individuals were completed, compared with a goal of 1,300.The fragile, three-party coalition government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras continues to vow it will crack down on corruption and tax evasion, but a blunt assessment last month by a task force of Greece’s foreign lenders said, “These changes have not yet been reflected in results in terms of improved tax inspection and collection.” Analysts say the failure to pursue tax evaders aggressively is deepening social tensions. “It’s a weak government with very difficult work to do, and this is very, very bad for the morale of the people,” said Nikos Xydakis, a political columnist for Kathimerini, a daily newspaper. “This year will be hell for the middle-class people. And the rich people are untouchable. This is very bad.”In a separate report, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund said they were concerned that the “authorities are falling idle and that the drive to fight tax evasion by the very wealthy and the free professions is at risk of weakening.”The report added that total unpaid taxes amounted to nearly $70 billion, about 25 percent of Greece’s gross domestic product. But only about 15 percent to 20 percent of the amount is actually collectible, either because the statute of limitations has run out or the scofflaws do not have the money.It pressed Greece to focus on the cases most likely to produce real revenues, especially in vocations where tax evasion has become pernicious. “Doctors and lawyers are a good place to start,” it said.Critics, especially the leftist party Syriza, which leads in opinion polls, say the government has not done enough to stop corruption because its members are tied to the country’s business elite and do not want to jeopardize their political careers.“The problem is not simply tax evasion among the rich,” said Zoe Konstantopoulou, a member of Parliament from Syriza who serves on a panel investigating the so-called Lagarde list, a compilation of more than 2,000 Greeks with accounts in a Swiss branch of HSBC that had been sent to Mr. Papaconstantinou in 2010 by Christine Lagarde, then the finance minister of France. “The problem is tax evasion among the rich with the complicity and the aiding and abetting of those who govern.”While Greece received a badly needed $45 billion in aid last month to help it avoid defaulting on its debts, critics say that unless Athens can more forcefully tap the billions it is owed in taxes, it will never pay off its debts, even if its moribund economy eventually starts to recover.A dysfunctional bureaucracy weakened by budget cuts, two destabilizing rounds of elections last spring and an economy decimated by austerity have hampered tax collections further. But a thicket of regulations and a culture of resistance also fuel a shadow economy that includes an estimated 25 percent of economic activity.One study by researchers from the University of Chicago and Virginia Tech estimated that tax evasion costs Greece about $37 billion a year, equivalent to nearly 15 percent of economic output. The study found that doctors, engineers, accountants and lawyers were “the primary tax-evading occupations.”The reports were released shortly before Greece’s financial crimes squad accused Mr. Papaconstantinou late last month of removing the names of three of his relatives from the Lagarde list.Those accounts belonged to a cousin of Mr. Papaconstantinou’s, her husband and the spouse of another cousin. On Wednesday, the cousin, Eleni Papaconstantinou-Sikiaridis, resigned from her post at the Greek privatization agency, saying in a letter that the money held in the HSBC Geneva account was “the legal wealth of myself and my husband.”Mr. Papaconstantinou has vehemently denied the accusations and has said that he worked to clamp down on tax evasion as finance minister from 2009 until 2011. “I handed to the tax authorities all the files which I received from the French authorities,” he said in an e-mail. “I am not in a position to confirm that the original information received in 2010 contained the three files concerned,” he added, about his relatives.“If the original is identical to the new one sent by the French authorities two weeks ago, this means that someone removed the names after I handed the files over,” he said.Mr. Papaconstantinou told Parliament in November that he had asked the head of the financial crimes unit at the time to investigate only the names of the 20 biggest account holders on the list. In the e-mail interview, he said that an aide in his office pulled together the names, which he said accounted for about half of the money in the accounts.He said he had been uneasy releasing the full 2,000 names to financial investigators for fear that they would be leaked. “Surely it is easier to safeguard an investigation of 20 people than one of 2,000 people,” he said.Mr. Papaconstantinou testified that he then passed the entire file in June 2011 to the head of Greece’s financial crimes unit, Ioannis Diotis, who later gave it to Mr. Papaconstantinou’s successor, Evangelos Venizelos, the current leader of the Socialists and a rival of Mr. Papaconstantinou’s.Mr. Diotis said that Mr. Venizelos did not give him orders to investigate the names on the list. Mr. Venizelos said Mr. Diotis had told him the material was unusable as it had been illegally acquired. Mr. Venizelos added that he passed the memory stick to the prime minister, Mr. Samaras, last October after Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras said the authorities could not find the original list.On Thursday, Syriza called for an investigation into Mr. Papaconstantinou and Mr. Venizelos, and it labeled the current coalition government “the architects of corruption, and of the cover-up of corruption.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/technology/googles-rivals-say-ftc-antitrust-ruling-missed-the-point.html,"WASHINGTON — One of the more surprising conclusions drawn by the Federal Trade Commission when it dropped its nearly two-year antitrust investigation into Google last week was that Google, far from harming consumers, had actually helped them.But some critics of the inquiry now contend that the commission found no harm in Google’s actions because it was looking at the wrong thing.Instead of considering harm to people who come to Google to search for information, Google’s competitors and their supporters say that the government should have been looking at whether Google’s actions harmed its real customers — the companies that pay billions of dollars each year to advertise on Google’s site.In its reports, the F.T.C. did not detail how it defined harm or what quantitative measures it had used to determine that Google users were better off.But interviews with people on all sides of the investigation — government officials, Google supporters, advocates for Microsoft and other competitors, and antitrust experts and economists — show that many of the yardsticks the commission used to measure its outcomes were remarkably similar to Google’s own. Not surprisingly, they cast Google in a favorable light.At issue were changes that Google made in recent years to its popular search page. Google makes frequent adjustments to the formulas that determine what results are generated when a user enters a search. Currently, it makes more than 500 changes a year, or more than one each day.Users rarely notice the changes in the formulas, or algorithms, that generate search results, but businesses do. If a change in the formulas causes a business to rank lower in the order of results generated by a search, it is likely to miss potential customers.What customers are now seeing reflects changes in the format of Google results. For certain categories of searches — travel information, shopping comparisons and financial data, for example — Google has begun presenting links to its own related services.People close to the investigation said that Google had presented the F.T.C. with the results of tests with focus groups hired by an outside firm to review different versions of a Google search results page. After Google acquired ITA, a travel search business, in 2011, it began testing a new way to display flight results.The company asked test users to compare side-by-side examples of a results page with just the familiar 10 blue links to specialty travel sites with a page that had at the top a box containing direct links to airlines and fares.People who reviewed the Google data said tests with hundreds of people showed that fewer than one in five users preferred the page with links only. Users said they liked the box of flight results, so Google reasoned that making the change was better for the consumer.“There is a deep science to search evaluation,” Amit Singhal, a senior vice president who oversees Google’s search operation, said in an interview on Friday. “A lot of work goes into every change we make.”But the changes were not better for companies or alternative travel sites that were pushed off the first page of results by Google’s flight box and associated links. By pushing links to competing sites lower, Google might be making things easier for people who come to it for free search. But it also is having a negative effect on competitors, shutting off traffic for those sites.Drawing fewer customers as a result of Google’s free links, those competitors are forced to advertise more to draw traffic. And advertisers who aren’t competitors have fewer places to go to reach consumers, meaning Google can use its market power to raise advertising prices.“There might be no consumer harm if Google eliminates Yelp,” said one Microsoft advocate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the likelihood of further interactions with the F.T.C. “But advertisers certainly are harmed.”Google’s suggestion that the correct way to measure the benefit of a design change was through user appreciation seemed to strike a chord with the commission. In its statement explaining why it took no action against Google on search bias, the F.T.C. said that “the documents, testimony and qualitative evidence the commission examined are largely consistent with the conclusion that Google likely benefited consumers by prominently displaying its vertical content on its search results page.”F.T.C. officials said they considered data from a wide range of sources — those with interests aligned with Google as well as against it. The officials also bought quantitative data about Internet usage and conducted interviews with experts who were independent of all sides.None of the data was taken strictly at face value, Howard Shelanski, director of the F.T.C.’s Bureau of Economics, said in an interview. “We kick the tires hard on all of the data we receive.”While some of Google’s competitors might have suffered when Google made changes to the way it generated and displayed search results, the F.T.C. said, “the totality of the evidence” showed that “any negative impact on actual or potential competitors was incidental.”The five commissioners at the F.T.C. voted unanimously not to pursue a case accusing Google of using unfair competition to enhance its search business. One of those commissioners, however, warned that there was little to prevent Google from misrepresenting the value of the changes it made to its search methods.That commissioner, J. Thomas Rosch, a Republican who criticized the F.T.C.’s decision not to seek a court order preventing Google from certain actions, said, “Nothing in this ‘settlement’ prevents Google from telling ‘half truths’ — for example, that its gathering of information about the characteristics of a consumer is done solely for the consumer’s benefit, instead of also to maintain a monopoly or near monopoly position.”Google’s interest in maintaining its market dominance — it accounts for about 70 percent of all searches in the United States — goes beyond its dedication to improving the experience for users, of course.Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman, said that while “some evidence suggested that Google was trying to eliminate competition,” that was not necessarily illegal. “Some may believe the commission should have done more in this case, because they are locked in hand-to-hand combat with Google around the world and have the mistaken belief that criticizing us will influence the outcome in other jurisdictions,” he said.The commissioners also appeared to view Google’s changes to its results pages as a design issue as much as an antitrust one. “Product design is an important dimension of competition,” the commission wrote, “and condemning legitimate product improvements risks harming consumers.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/opinion/the-next-round-of-tax-increases.html,"When the White House announced the deal on the fiscal cliff last week, it was quick — and correct — to note that much was left undone. There was still “substantial” room, the administration said, to raise taxes on high-income Americans, to reform corporate taxes and to reform entitlements, with the aim of “balanced” deficit reduction.The White House seems to think the deal has established a firm foundation for building a new fiscal house. In fact, the deal could make tax reform less likely. And without reform to raise new revenue, deficit reduction would have to rely heavily on spending cuts, an outcome that can be averted only by persuasive and sustained leadership from President Obama.One way the deal could undermine tax reform is that contrary to Republican complaints, its basic framework of low tax rates and lots of loopholes is bound to prove acceptable, even popular. The deal retains the Bush-era tax cuts and almost all existing deductions and tax breaks, except for a few changes affecting a sliver of high-income Americans, generally defined as those with taxable income above $450,000, and even they did not fare badly (their new top rate of 39.6 percent is still among the lowest top rates in the 100-year history of the income tax).The deal removes impetus for reform by permanently “patching” the alternative minimum tax. The change ensures that the A.M.T. will no longer routinely threaten to ensnare tens of millions of taxpayers for whom it was never intended. This is a step in the direction of better tax policy, but it also means the loss of the A.M.T. as a potent reminder of just how in need of reform the tax code is.The deal will also play into the wrongheaded, but widespread, idea that corporations should not have to pay higher taxes. Congressional Republicans have made it clear that they will fight all further tax increases, while some Democrats have voiced support for corporate tax reform that would streamline the code but not raise more revenue. Put those two views together, and you have the makings of a bipartisan agreement to reform corporate taxes without raising revenue. That would be indefensible at a time when corporate tax avoidance has already driven corporate tax revenues close to all-time lows as a share of both federal revenues and the economy.Mr. Obama has pledged to demand significant tax increases as deficit reduction talks go forward. The fiscal cliff deal could leave him with less room to maneuver. But caps on deductions, higher taxes on investment income and a financial transaction tax are worth fighting for, as are broader tax reforms, like a carbon tax and a value-added tax, that could take effect as the economy recovers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/economy/companies-exploit-tax-break-for-asset-exchanges-trial-evidence-shows.html,"It began more than 90 years ago as a small tax break intended to help family farmers who wanted to swap horses and land. Farmers who sold property, livestock or equipment were allowed to avoid paying capital gains taxes, as long as they used the proceeds to replace or upgrade their assets.Over the years, however, as the rules were loosened, the practice of exchanging one asset for another without incurring taxes spread to everyone from commercial real estate developers and art collectors to major corporations. It provides subsidies for rental truck fleets and investment property, vacation homes, oil wells and thoroughbred racehorses, and diverts billions of dollars in potential tax revenue from the Treasury each year.Yet even with those generous terms, some major American companies — including Cendant, Wells Fargo and General Electric — have routinely pushed the boundaries while claiming lucrative tax savings, according to evidence recently presented at a federal trial in New York.President Obama and Congressional leaders agreed New Year’s Day to a limited agreement to raise taxes on the wealthy, and the president said over the weekend that he would press this year for broader reform in the tax code. The expansion of the tax break once intended to help farmers illustrates the challenges ahead and how special interests have learned to use the tax code to maximum effect.The federal government now allows more than $1.1 trillion a year in this and other tax expenditures. Each of those incentives — which include hundreds of exemptions, exclusions, deferrals and preferential rates — either adds to the budget deficit or shifts the cost of government to other taxpayers.Some are narrowly targeted and offer aid to specific industries like Nascar owners, asparagus farmers, oil companies, yacht makers or solar panel producers. Others, like accelerated depreciation or the tax code’s preference for debt financing over equity, provide tax benefits for wide swaths of businesses.“Tax expenditures are very similar to an entitlement program, so they’re easy to start,” said George K. Yin, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. “But once a tax break gets started, people think they’re entitled to it, so they are very difficult to end.”Many tax breaks began with narrow targets and expanded into vast, expensive subsidies far beyond their original intent or the Internal Revenue Service’s ability to monitor them. Most have developed constituencies of taxpayers, lobbyists and elected officials who fiercely defend them, making it politically treacherous to limit or eliminate them.With hundreds of thousands of transactions a year, it is hard to gauge the true cost of the tax break for so-called like-kind exchanges, like those used by Cendant, General Electric and Wells Fargo. The government estimates that it diverts less than $3 billion a year from the Treasury, but industry statistics suggest the number could be far higher.The tax break also exposes one of the greatest vulnerabilities of the United States tax system: it depends on voluntary compliance. The I.R.S. staff is so outnumbered by tax lawyers and accounting departments at major corporations that there is often little to prevent taxpayers from taking a freewheeling approach to interpreting and administering the rules.What’s more, the tax break is one of so many that it tends to escape attention. The independent Simpson-Bowles deficit commission appointed by Mr. Obama in 2010 raised the possibility of eliminating it and other tax expenditures, however, and some budget experts argue that the program should be severely limited or repealed.Some financial planners and economists say that the tax break even favors real estate investors unfairly by allowing them to defer capital gains taxes that those who invest in securities and other ventures have to pay. And although it was originally intended to help farmers, some economists and lawmakers in agricultural areas say it has perversely contributed to suburban sprawl and the spiraling cost of farmland. Because it allows farmers to avoid capital gains taxes on land swaps, the tax break provides an incentive to sell farmland coveted by developers and buy property in less desirable and more remote areas.A crucial element of the tax break is that companies cannot use the proceeds of an asset sale for any purpose other than buying a replacement. Because the break is intended to encourage reinvestment in a business, companies that sell an asset are required to deposit the proceeds from the sale into an escrow account, which must be controlled by a third party. If the company has control of the money, the tax break is disallowed, according to tax experts.“Funds cannot be held under the taxpayer’s sole control,” said David Shechtman, a lawyer who headed the American Bar Association tax committee that oversees the exchanges.Documents and testimony at the recent federal trial indicate that a subsidiary of one of the nation’s largest banks, JPMorgan Chase, stood by for years as the companies — most of which were also major depositors in the bank — bent the rules governing these exchanges of property. JPMorgan sold the subsidiary in 2008.At least a half-dozen companies were allowed unrestricted access, according to evidence at the trial. For at least 30 months, Wells Fargo had unfettered access to billions of dollars intended to be held in escrow, the records show. And American subsidiaries of Volkswagen and BMW had so much control over the money that they used it as collateral to obtain lines of credit.Oscar Suris, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, declined to comment. Officials at Volkswagen and BMW said they were confident that the companies were in full compliance with tax regulations. A spokesman for Cendant, John Barrows, said that company, which is now the Avis Budget Group, had complied with all tax laws and I.R.S. regulations.JPMorgan’s lawyers argued during the trial that the instances in which its clients were apparently allowed to skirt the tax rules had been few, inadvertent and, in some cases, approved by tax lawyers and accountants who worked for the companies. Officials at JPEX, the subsidiary that handled the transactions, testified that because they were not tax experts, they deferred to their clients’ accountants and legal specialists.JPMorgan said its employees never violated tax regulations.“The court agreed that our firm acted appropriately and that this business complied with all relevant tax laws at the time our firm owned it,” said Joseph Evangelisti, a company spokesman.The largest corporation cited in the case, General Electric, had unrestricted access to nearly $300 million from transactions made by its equipment finance subsidiary from 2007 to 2009, according to testimony, documents and company officials. The money — which saved G.E. $3 million to $4 million a year in interest because of tax deferrals, according to company estimates — was kept in G.E.’s internal computer system, WebCash, which is controlled solely by company employees rather than by an intermediary.Russell Wilkerson, a managing director at G.E. Capital, said outside tax advisers had assured the company that its unorthodox arrangement met I.R.S. regulations because it required the approval of the intermediary before any transaction was made.“G.E. has always executed its like-kind exchange programs in a fully compliant manner, without exception,” Mr. Wilkerson said.Evidence about the questionable procedures was made public as part of a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court by NES Financial, a California company that acquired JPEX in 2008. NES Financial sought more than $20 million in damages, saying that JPMorgan had failed to reveal the apparent violations before the unit’s sale, and that the I.R.S., which is now auditing several of its clients, could impose millions of dollars in back taxes and penalties on the corporations.Judge Victor Marrero dismissed the suit, despite evidence that some of the companies were not following I.R.S. regulations. In his ruling in late November, he said NES Financial had not proved it was likely to face losses.Several JPEX employees said at the trial that the company had, in some cases, allowed clients access to money that was supposed to be segregated.I.R.S. officials are reviewing some of the companies that used JPMorgan Chase, according to evidence presented at the trial, though it is not clear which ones. General Electric said it was not the subject of an inquiry.Even as the debate over the tax break continues, there is a deep conviction in the real estate business that it is justified. Advocates for the real estate industry say that a large majority of transactions are conducted in strict compliance with I.R.S. regulations. Because the asset exchanges spur investment and help create jobs, industry officials say they would strenuously oppose any effort to end them.“Historically, these exchanges are a very important consideration for a very important segment of the economy,” said Jeffrey D. DeBoer, chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable. “I have no reason to believe that Congress won’t ultimately recognize that.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/us/politics/mitch-mcconnell-says-no-to-more-tax-increases.html,"WASHINGTON — The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, made clear on Sunday that he would oppose any effort by the Obama administration to raise more tax revenue and that he remained focused on finding ways to cut spending as the government grapples with its debt.“The tax issue is finished,” Mr. McConnell said on the ABC News program “This Week.” “Over. Completed. That’s behind us.”Mr. McConnell’s interviews on three Sunday morning programs came just days after he and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. helped broker a resolution to the latest fiscal crisis and as Washington braced for a series of confrontations over debt and spending.Mr. McConnell’s stance on taxes countered calls from Democrats, and even some House Republicans, to revamp the tax code to close some provisions and raise new revenue. But Mr. McConnell did say he would favor changes if they were “revenue neutral,” meaning that lower rates would be paid for by limiting deductions and closing loopholes.Mr. McConnell’s focus on the need for spending cuts was relentless in his interviews on ABC, NBC and CBS. He was equally insistent that President Obama must take the lead on fiscal plans.His remarks stood in contrast to comments from the Senate’s No. 2 Democrat, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who said on the CNN program “State of the Union” that there was plenty of room to increase revenue by examining “deductions, credits, special treatments under the tax code.”Mr. McConnell’s position also contrasted with remarks on Saturday by Mr. Obama, who said in his weekly address that he remained open to both spending cuts and further tax increases. The fiscal agreement last week made tax cuts permanent for most households and put off big spending cuts.Mr. Obama, who was speaking from Hawaii before returning to Washington on Sunday, emphasized his own line in the sand. Now that the government has reached its statutory borrowing limit, Mr. Obama said, Congress had no choice but to raise it to avoid a damaging default. He said the matter was not up for negotiation.“If Congress refuses to give the United States the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic,” Mr. Obama said. “Our families and our businesses cannot afford that dangerous game again.”Mr. McConnell repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he supported Republican senators who have suggested that a default — and even a brief shutdown of the government — might be necessary to secure deep spending cuts.“My answer is hopefully we don’t need to get to that point,” he said on ABC. “The president surely must know we’re spending way too much. So why don’t we do something about reducing spending?”Mr. McConnell also suggested that other Obama administration priorities, including a new push for gun restrictions after the Connecticut school shooting, might have to wait.Mr. McConnell was asked about reports that Mr. Biden, whom Mr. Obama charged with developing proposals to address gun violence, had confidently predicted the passage of gun-control legislation this month.Mr. McConnell seemed to cast cold water on that notion.“The biggest problem we have at the moment is spending and debt,” he said. “That’s going to dominate the Congress between now and the end of March. None of these issues, I think, will have the kind of priority that spending and debt will have.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/judge-sends-back-20-million-settlement-to-bank-of-america-suit.html,"Two pension funds that agreed to a relatively small settlement with the directors of Bank of America over its acquisition of Merrill Lynch are being ordered by a federal judge to strike a better deal beginning on Monday.The judge, P. Kevin Castel, voiced clear reservations about the $20 million settlement in a ruling on Friday, concluding that fees requested by the lawyers for the two funds could consume “some, most or all” of the money. The deal was reached last spring, months before two other pension funds in a separate lawsuit negotiated a $2.4 billion settlement with the bank over the Merrill purchase.Lawyers representing the pension funds in the $20 million settlement — the Louisiana Municipal Police Employees’ Retirement System and the Hollywood Police Officers’ Retirement System, of Florida — last October asked the court to approve payments of as much as $13 million in legal fees, or 65 percent of the amount proposed under the settlement.The pension funds have accused Kenneth D. Lewis, the former chief executive of Bank of America, and his fellow directors of misleading investors about Merrill’s deteriorating financial condition. Bank of America’s $50 billion purchase of Merrill Lynch was announced by Mr. Lewis in the fall of 2008 as the financial crisis was deepening, and it generated billions of dollars in losses for the bank. Those losses led to Bank of America’s second request for bailout money under the government’s Troubled Asset Relief Program.In addition to $20 million in cash, the proposed settlement would also require Bank of America to institute corporate governance changes. Among them are an enhanced director-education program and the creation of a new board committee dedicated to oversight of major acquisitions by the company. The case was brought as a so-called derivative action, on behalf of the bank itself.In a deposition, Mr. Lewis testified that before Bank of America stockholders voted to approve the acquisition he received loss estimates relating to Merrill that were far greater than those reflected in the merger documents filed with regulators. Shareholders rely on statements made in these filings to decide whether to approve transactions their companies have proposed; companies must disclose facts that could be meaningful for shareholders as they weigh voting on a deal.Given these and other facts of the various litigations, the shareholders who filed the parallel case in Delaware against the bank’s directors objected to the terms of the $20 million settlement. In court filings, lawyers representing these shareholders said that representatives of the Louisiana and Florida plaintiffs had done little investigation, deposing only two of the bank’s directors, and failed to ascertain whether the board had sufficient assets to contribute to a settlement.The lawyers in the Delaware case also argued in court that the $20 million settlement was grossly inadequate because of $500 million in directors’ and officers’ insurance purchased by Bank of America that is available to satisfy the matter. In addition, the lawyers said, the directors are not contributing personally to the settlement in spite of having the financial resources to do so. Directors are rarely held personally liable in lawsuits against companies.In addition to these objections, the lawyers in the Delaware case noted that the $20 million is far lower than the $150 million fine paid by the bank in 2010 to resolve a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission over the Merrill acquisition.Amid these arguments, Bank of America settled another class-action case in September involving the same allegations about the Merrill purchase. Under that deal, the bank agreed to pay $2.4 billion, dwarfing the amount the Louisiana and Florida plaintiffs had settled for in April. The $2.4 billion settlement was brought by lawyers representing public pension funds in Ohio and Texas. That case was also heard by Judge Castel.Another possible sticking point in the proposed $20 million settlement is how much of the money will go to the lawyers representing the Louisiana and Florida pension funds. Last October, those lawyers asked the court to approve payments of as much as $13 million in legal fees, or 65 percent of the amount proposed under the settlement.Late Friday, Judge Castel voiced clear reservations on the deal, writing, “The court has not yet been persuaded of the fairness, reasonableness and adequacy of a settlement of the derivative claims against defendant Lewis in exchange for corporate governance reforms of unquantifiable value and $20 million in cash, some, most or all of which may be consumed by plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees.”Joseph E. White III, a lawyer at Saxena White who represents the Louisiana and Florida pension funds, did not immediately return a phone call or respond to an e-mail seeking comment on Sunday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/us/politics/paul-ryan-balances-pragmatism-and-politics.html,"WASHINGTON — After Senator John McCain’s failed presidential bid in 2008, he repaired to the Senate to become a thorn in President Obama’s side. His running mate, Sarah Palin, used her considerable clout on the right to rally her fervent supporters against Mr. Obama and Democrats.But when the vice-presidential hopes of Representative Paul D. Ryan were dashed this Election Day, he returned to the House of Representatives and last week helped pass a bipartisan tax deal sought by Mr. Obama.Mr. Ryan’s vote in support of the plan, which raised tax rates on high income while locking in lower rates for the vast majority of households, was both pragmatic and political. In what he described as a “tough decision,” he backed what was seen by most in Congress as a piece of legislation whose passage was necessary to avert a fiscal crisis. Notably, his support aligned him with Speaker John A. Boehner, who voted for the measure. But it put him in conflict with his two fellow “young guns,” Representatives Eric Cantor of Virginia and Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 and 3 House Republicans. The three men had been in virtual lock step on policy issues and wrote a book together.It was the first in a series of votes on budget and deficit reduction measures expected in the coming months, all potentially reverberating in the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. A potential rival to Mr. Ryan for the nomination, should both decide to run, is Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was among only eight senators to vote no, the first clear demarcation between the two men since the election.(Before the vote, when asked by a reporter if Mr. Rubio’s “no” vote would influence his own, Mr. Ryan laughed and said, “Give me a break!” according to a recounting on Twitter.)Congressional supporters of Mr. Ryan describe his vote as an illustration of leadership. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he was motivated by the chance to make the lower tax rates for most households permanent, these supporters say. And as a legislator whose actions are watched closely by fellow members, they add, he does not have the luxury of taking a purely ideological stance.Mr. Ryan, his supporters say, did not necessarily return to the House to start building a presidential campaign. Instead, he is interested in continuing to mix things up as one of his party’s leading voices on budget matters. He is interested in forging an even tighter bond with Mr. Boehner as the fiscal fights play out, they say, starting in the coming weeks with a debate over whether to authorize raising the government’s borrowing limit and how to avoid deep across-the-board spending cuts set in motion by previous compromises. “I understand why somebody would want to vote no, but I understand why we had to vote yes,” said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who voted in favor of the deal. “But leadership is voting yes when you need to, and we needed to, because if the bill had failed, the stock markets wouldn’t have gone up 300 points; they would have gone down 1,000, and all those guys pounding their chests would have folded like a cheap suit.”He added: “I thought it was a very responsible vote.”In a statement released by his office after the vote, Mr. Ryan described his decision this way: “Will the American people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative? In the final analysis, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I came to Congress to make tough decisions — not to run away from them.”Mr. Rubio, in a statement explaining his vote, warned that “rapid economic growth and job creation will be made more difficult under the deal reached here in Washington.” He added: “This deal just postpones the inevitable, the need to solve our growing debt crisis and help the 23 million Americans who can’t find the work they need.”Those close to Mr. Rubio point to what they say is his unwavering allegiance to conservative principles and note that his sticking point was the tax increase on the highest earners.“It’s bad policy that fails to address the real fiscal issues facing our country,” said Alex Conant, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio. “When it comes to taxes, we need tax reform that will promote growth. That’s the only way to solve our fiscal problems in the long run, and nothing in the package that was passed was designed to promote growth.”Of course, it is always tricky to gauge the political impact a vote will have four years later. When Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards, as senators, voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002, their positions were seen as a political no-brainer. Yet during the 2008 Democratic primary, Mr. Obama’s initial opposition to the Iraq war helped catapult him to the nomination.Mr. Ryan’s vote, which lent support to Mr. Boehner, also places him squarely in a role he has long found comfortable: that of the dutiful Republican soldier. Mr. Ryan voted in favor of many large and contentious issues — the Medicare prescription drug plan, the bank and auto bailouts — and in the process cast aside conservative orthodoxy to support his party’s leadership.His tax vote, however, was also a calculated one. He believes that the coming fights on spending and deficit reduction will fall squarely in his budget “sweet spot,” in the words of a friend. And with Mr. Boehner’s backing, Mr. Ryan has a better chance of influencing those debates.On Friday, in a vote that seemed to move him closer to his image as a fiscal hawk intent on lowering government spending, Mr. Ryan joined 66 Republican members to oppose a flood insurance bill that would take on more than $9 billion in debt to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.  “Paul has the long game in mind, so taking short-term pops at Boehner does not advance the conservative agenda,” an associate close to Mr. Ryan said. “He’s politically invested in his partnership with Boehner.”Many Congressional Republicans said they understood both positions on the fiscal bill, and though Mr. Ryan incurred some anger online from the right wing, those in Washington said that the 2016 race would probably turn on larger fights yet to come.“I just don’t think 2016 is going to be litigated through the lens of this one vote,” said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former adviser to Mitt Romney, “because in a month or two, we’re going to be onto a whole new deadline fight, and there will be plenty of votes and plenty of areas where you can still build your political profile and your electoral profile where you’re a viable candidate in 2016 — the full body of work so to speak.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/arts/television/seinfeld-to-continue-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee.html,"Jerry Seinfeld and Sony Pictures Television have decided to produce a second season of the short-run, experimental Internet series that Mr. Seinfeld created last year, “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” a decision that mimics those made when a new comedy on television gets an order for a second season.But the whole idea behind the Internet show, Mr. Seinfeld said, was to try to break into a medium other than TV. The decision to produce 24 new episodes, to be announced Monday, puts Mr. Seinfeld and Sony on the same track as sites like Netflix — which has forthcoming series like “Arrested Development” and “House of Cards” — in testing the waters to see if original, network-quality entertainment can emerge on the Internet.“It’s kind of a new paradigm that we’re trying to create,” Mr. Seinfeld said in a telephone interview, referring to himself and Sony. “I think we both were craving that little sandbox feeling we had when we started out.”Now they need to chase the same thing that other creators of original Internet content have been after: profits.“This next go-round we’re going to have to figure out some sort of revenue stream, so it makes more sense,” Mr. Seinfeld said.The first 10 episodes of “Comedians in Cars” contain no advertising and appear free on the Sony Web site Crackle and at comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com, the show’s own site. The format is a talk show of sorts that features Mr. Seinfeld riding around in vintage cars with friends in the comedy business, making detours to converse over food and coffee. Steve Mosko, the president of Sony Pictures Television, said that almost as soon as Mr. Seinfeld’s new show began appearing, “high-end advertisers were banging on our doors” seeking some level of sponsorship. But, he said, Mr. Seinfeld did not want to turn the first season “into something that gets cluttered.”Mr. Seinfeld said he was taking ideas that held personal interest and adapting them for the Internet. “I thought of all the things I liked,” he said, which included almost anything about cars, talking with other comics, and coffee in its various forms. He put that together with his observation that all around him “people were watching stuff on phones and pads,” and he concluded, “Well, this is stuff I like, and this could be a match.”Besides, he said, the show might have special appeal for “comedy geeks,” who “were missing a little piece of the puzzle — the kind of idiotic relationships that we have that are a big part of this life.”Mr. Seinfeld said he never thought of the concept as something for traditional television; he loved the flexibility of the Internet, particularly no fixed duration for any of the episodes. (Each one runs about 11 to 17 minutes, and guests have included his old “Seinfeld” partner Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Alec Baldwin and Mel Brooks.)Mr. Seinfeld said he took the idea initially to executives at several Internet-based companies, drawing strong interest. “It was just too hard to explain, and they started asking the usual questions, and I started getting that not-good feeling: Oh, I’m back in the old game,” he said. “And I don’t want to play the old game. I played that game. I want to play a new game.”He turned to Sony because it distributes the repeats of his sitcom, and he had a good relationship with Mr. Mosko. Mr. Seinfeld owns the “Comedians in Cars” show, and Sony will continue to serve as backer and distributor.Mr. Mosko said the studio was more than pleased with the first season, which he said attracted more than 10 million unique visitors to Crackle. Developing Internet programming is a crucial part of Sony’s future, he said.“What’s missing in developing programming for the Internet is patience, trying to get it right,” he said. “We’re both looking at this as a long-term investment.”As for revenue streams, some form of sponsorship is likely to be attached to the new episodes when they start appearing this spring. But only if advertising can be integrated in the right way, Mr. Mosko said, adding, “We know there’s an opportunity there.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/business/avis-and-hertz-expand-raising-questions-over-future-rates.html,"The car rental business is consolidating, with Hertz’s acquisition of Dollar Thrifty in November and the Avis Budget Group’s announcement last week that it planned to buy the car-sharing company Zipcar. Does this mean that consumers will have fewer options and end up paying more to rent a car?In the short term, industry analysts do not think so. They are less certain about what will happen in the long term.With the Hertz deal, the number of major car rental companies is dropping to three, from four, but there are still enough brands to keep prices stable, analysts said. Prices, they added, tend to be driven by supply and demand in regional markets.With the Avis deal, analysts said, Zipcar users may actually gain options.Zipcar, founded in 2000, works on a car-sharing business model and has a fleet of just 12,000 cars worldwide, compared with about 1.7 million rental cars in the United States alone. Its acquisition by Avis gives members “more alternatives and the potential of having more options,” said Neil Abrams, the founder of the Abrams Consulting Group, a car rental consulting and travel market research organization in Purchase, N.Y.Zipcar members can rent by the hour or by the day, which is appealing to people who drive infrequently. “Why pay for something you don’t need?” Mr. Abrams said. “It’s a very cost-effective system if used properly.” On the other hand, he said, if you pay by the hour and need the car for a whole day, a Zipcar can cost more, depending on the model, than a traditional rental car.Zipcars are not typically located in airports, where competition is greater. The company serves a different market, including drivers younger than 25, who may not be able to rent from traditional companies. It also serves large urban areas like New York, Los Angeles, Washington, London and Barcelona, Spain, where people do not want to own a car but want quick access to one for short periods.Analysts say Zipcar can raise its hourly rate only so much before it will drive away customers.“Prices can only go so high,” said Chris Brown, executive editor of Auto Rental News, based in Torrance, Calif. “If prices go too high, consumers won’t rent. They will use other types of transportation. They’ll borrow a friend’s car, use public transportation or take a train.”Avis has indicated that it intends to increase the size of the Zipcar fleet. “We expect to apply Avis Budget’s experience and efficiencies of fleet management with Zipcar’s proven, customer-friendly technology to accelerate the growth of the Zipcar brand and to provide more options for Zipsters in more places,” Ronald L. Nelson, chairman and chief executive of Avis, said in a statement.In the Hertz deal, the Federal Trade Commission has played a major role in preserving competition in airport car rental markets by requiring Hertz to sell its Advantage Rent a Car business and the rights to operate about 30 Dollar Thrifty locations in airports throughout the United States.A proposed agreement was open to public comment through Dec. 17, and the F.T.C. will determine soon whether to make it final.The commission complained that Hertz’s original plans for acquiring Dollar Thrifty would be anticompetitive. It contended that by reducing the number of major competitors to three, the acquisition would create “substantially more concentration in 72 airport rental car markets nationwide” and “eliminate head-to-head competition between Hertz and Dollar Thrifty” at several airports, including Baltimore-Washington International Airport, Chicago O’Hare International Airport and Kennedy Airport in New York.The F.T.C. said the deal, as originally proposed, would have harmed competition by reducing the number of competitors and enabling Hertz to raise rental car prices.Precisely because the commission has stepped into the acquisition, prices are likely to remain stable, industry analysts said.“Better pricing, higher pricing, may be the case, but not in the near future,” Mr. Brown of Auto Rental News said of the Hertz-Dollar Thrifty deal.He and other analysts described four tiers of rental cars: the premium brands of Avis, Hertz and National; the midprice brands of Budget and Alamo; the value brands of Dollar, Thrifty and Enterprise; and the deep discount brands of Advantage, Payless and Fox, an emerging player.A deep discount brand like Fox or Sixt, based in Europe, is likely to step into the markets where the F.T.C. requires Hertz to sell its Advantage business and Dollar Thrifty locations, Mr. Brown said, because premium brands are already in those markets.Rather than prices going up, “brands will still be competing with each other for market share,” he said. He predicted a “grand war on rates” for the deep discount customer. Sixt has already entered the American market with nine locations, including the Miami, Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Palm Beach and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta airports.Mr. Abrams said rental companies preferred to keep prices stable and spend their energy on trying to gain market share.Car rental prices are lower now than they were in 2009, and Mr. Abrams said he did not expect them to increase because of the Hertz deal. “The concerns of the F.T.C. that pricing would be compromised from a consumer perspective — that won’t happen,” he said.According to data compiled by Abrams Travel Data Services, the research business unit of Mr. Abrams’s company, rental car prices have declined after peaking in 2009, “when inventories contracted significantly as demand cratered,” he said.In 2009, the daily rate for the second Monday in November was about $89, not including taxes and fees, which vary. The rate dropped to nearly $73 in 2010 and to about $55 in 2011 before increasing to a little over $65 in 2012. The daily rate is for a midsize car.He noted that Dollar Thrifty had been of interest to other rental car companies because it represented a way to gain market share in the value market for both leisure and business travelers.Other analysts agreed that they did not have immediate concerns about competition.“I expect the car rental industry to stay very competitive in the short term in both corporate and leisure segments,” said Doyle Gunnell, global project manager of ground transportation at Carlson Wagonlit Travel.The rental car market is fairly straightforward, said Nima Samadi, senior industry analyst at IBISWorld. “Pricing is based on regional demand,” he said. “This reduces the influences of merger and acquisition activity.”The Avis-Zipcar deal, Mr. Samadi said, will lead to “more cars and more locations at an hourly rate,” which is good for rental companies and for consumers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/world/middleeast/irans-oil-exports-and-sales-down-40-percent-official-admits.html,"Iran’s oil minister acknowledged for the first time on Monday that petroleum exports and sales had fallen by at least 40 percent over the past year, contradicting his previous denials and providing an unusual public admission that the cumulative impact of Western economic sanctions has grown more severe.The acknowledgment by the oil minister, Rostam Qasemi, came as new restrictions from the sanctions are threatening to further choke Iran’s ability to sell oil, its most important export. Under provisions of an American law that take effect in February, importers of Iranian oil that have been exempted from the sanctions cannot send the money used to buy it to Iran without risking penalties in the United States. The result could impound billions of dollars’ worth of Iran’s expected oil revenue in the banks of those importing countries.Additional punitive measures, which President Obama signed into law last week, broaden the roster of blacklisted Iranian industries to include all energy, shipping and shipbuilding enterprises and seek to restrict barter transactions that Iran has been using to circumvent earlier sanctions. Some critics of the new steps say they nearly amount to a trade embargo.In another consequence of the sanctions’ impact, the Oil Ministry on Monday stopped the sale of jet fuel to Iran’s heavily indebted domestic airlines unless they pay cash. The semiofficial Mehr news agency reported that most commercial airline flights inside the country had been canceled as a result.Mr. Qasemi, a former Revolutionary Guards commander who was appointed oil minister more than a year ago, had consistently asserted that Iran had no problem selling its oil. In September, in an address to the Parliament, he said that oil exports were rising, despite outside data that showed a sharp drop. At other times, he has threatened to halt all oil exports in retaliation for the sanctions, apparently in a vain effort to raise oil prices by frightening global oil traders.Both the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, of which Iran is a major member, and the International Energy Agency, a group of mostly Western oil-importing countries, have reported that Iran’s crude exports fell to roughly a million barrels a day by the end of 2012, compared with 2.4 million a year earlier.Other Iranian officials have said it is clear that the country’s oil exports have suffered.Economists knowledgeable about Iran’s sanctions problems said Mr. Qasemi’s acknowledgment of the export decline, made at a parliamentary meeting on finances, was inevitable because the government must find a way to fill a large gap in the budget — a gap that revenue from oil exports had been expected to fill.The Iranian Students’ News Agency quoted the minister as telling lawmakers that “there has been a 40 percent decrease in oil sales and a 45 percent decrease in repatriating oil money.” The agency also quoted him as forecasting further decreases without specifying how much.“It’s common knowledge in Iran that oil exports have fallen,” said Djavad Salehi-Isfahani, an economics professor at Virginia Tech, who visited his native Iran last month. “I don’t know if the oil minister had been in denial.”Dr. Salehi-Isfahani suggested that President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s government might have to resolve the budget deficit problem with an accounting maneuver that would recalculate the value of Iran’s oil sales at half the official foreign-exchange rate — 25,000 rials per dollar instead of the central bank’s artificial rate of 12,260 rials per dollar.That change would be much closer to the rial’s actual value and essentially double the amount — in rials — gained from Iranian oil exports. But such a move would also concede the sanctions’ severe inflationary impact, which has caused a steep fall in the value of the Iranian currency this past year.Many Iranians have suffered from the rial’s decline, which has essentially made them poorer by raising the price of imported goods. Iran’s inflation also has left many Iranian businesses unable to pay wages or bills. The problem surfaced in a new way on Monday with the abrupt cancellation of domestic flights by Iranian airlines, which had been buying fuel on credit.The head of the Airlines Association, Seyyed Abdol Reza Musavi, told Mehr that flights in Tehran, Kish, Mashhad and other airports had been halted because the carriers failed to repay their debts, and that fuel would now be provided “on a cash-only basis.” It was unclear how long the flight suspensions would last.The sanctions on Iran have been intensifying for the past few years because of its disputed nuclear program, which Iran says is for peaceful use but which Western countries and Israel suspect is meant to develop the ability to make nuclear weapons."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/arts/television/jimmy-kimmel-moves-to-an-1135-showtime-on-abc.html,"And Jimmy makes three.Starting on Tuesday night, all three traditional broadcast networks will go head-to-head at 11:35 with entertainment-talk shows, as Jimmy Kimmel on ABC joins Jay Leno on NBC and David Letterman on CBS.“Yes, I’m helping to further cheapen the medium,” Mr. Kimmel said in a telephone interview.The truth is, Mr. Kimmel has worked doggedly for a decade to carve out his own identity in late night. And over the last several years, especially in 2012, Mr. Kimmel has begun to emerge as a well-respected, distinctive late-night star, one ABC finally deemed ready for the big stage, the show right after the late local newscasts.The decision to move Mr. Kimmel from his midnight start time meant displacing the award-winning late-night news program “Nightline.” But ABC’s management has, since 2002, been seeking to switch to entertainment in late night, for the simple reason that the advertising money is so much greater for an entertainment show. ABC tried to woo both Mr. Letterman and Mr. Leno over that period, while Mr. Kimmel persevered, improving his monologue skills, polishing his performing style and making increasingly clever use of videos that stamped his show as an original rather than an imitation.“Creatively, he’s ahead,” said Robert Morton, who produced Mr. Letterman at NBC and later CBS, as well as the more recent late-night series on TBS that starred George Lopez. Mr. Kimmel, he added, “has a more viral presence than the others and he is strong in social media.”The change at ABC was accomplished without any of the emotional bloodletting that accompanied NBC’s two efforts to update “Tonight”: first when Mr. Leno outmaneuvered Mr. Letterman and grabbed the chair left by the genre’s biggest star, Johnny Carson, and then when NBC tapped Conan O’Brien to succeed Mr. Leno — a move that ended calamitously, with Mr. O’Brien ousted, Mr. Leno restored, and both men’s careers damaged.  In contrast, Mr. Kimmel is sliding into the 11:35 slot with minimal drama. Not that there weren’t moments of frustration that accompanied the wait.“I was on 10 years of probation,” Mr. Kimmel said. “We always told ABC we were ready to move up whenever we got the call. But I didn’t have to push them. It was not one of those things where I said, ‘I’m not going to sign my contract unless we get 11:35.’ They did this on their own.”Jill Leiderman, Mr. Kimmel’s executive producer for the last seven years, said: “Jimmy earned this through his diligence and hard work. He is now polished. He’s become a signature voice. He’s a younger presence.”That point is not insignificant. At 45, Mr. Kimmel is much younger than Mr. Letterman (65) and Mr. Leno (62). According to one prevailing line of speculation about why ABC finally promoted Mr. Kimmel, the network wanted to establish him with younger viewers who have been defecting from the two aging superstars before NBC eventually installs its own rising late-night comic, Jimmy Fallon, 38, as Mr. Leno’s successor at “Tonight.”ABC may also have circumvented a raid by another network. “No one had formally approached me because I’ve been under contract the whole time,” Mr. Kimmel said. “But there has definitely been some sniffing around.”The last year has been by far the most prominent of Mr. Kimmel’s career. He hosted the Emmy Awards; served as the entertainment for the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner; got engaged (to his head writer, Molly McNearney); and saluted Mr. Letterman (his childhood idol) on the Kennedy Center Honors program.  His show’s ratings also gained about 7 percent, to an average of just under two million viewers a night.At the Kennedy Center show, the possibility that the two late-night stars would soon become head-to-head competitors never came up, Mr. Kimmel said, noting, “I don’t think Dave cares.”He is convinced that Mr. Leno cares, however, and the fractiousness between the two has taken on the dimensions of a feud. Mr. Kimmel no longer modulates his shots at Mr. Leno (in a Rolling Stone interview this month he said, “As a comedian, you can’t not have disdain for what he’s done: He totally sold out.”)Executives who work on Mr. Kimmel’s show have noted that NBC has increased its promotional efforts on behalf of Mr. Leno and that in recent weeks “Tonight” has moved its formal starting time to 11:34.Mr. Leno tends to avoid responding to swats from competitors but usually doubles down on his competitive instincts.Mr. Morton predicted “a booking battle in L.A.,” with Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Leno fighting for the shrinking pool of A-level guests.For his first week at the new time, Mr. Kimmel seems to have loaded the stage. On Tuesday Jennifer Aniston will be the main guest, with the band No Doubt playing. Later in the week Sofia Vergara, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Bruno Mars, and Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers will turn up.But Mr. Kimmel said the earlier show will mostly resemble the one he has been doing at midnight — aside from a new set. Familiar comedy segments will be part of the mix, though new ones will be added. “I don’t think anyone will notice any difference other than the set,” he said. “And hopefully they will be awake this time when we’re on.”But Ms. Leiderman said there would be one significant format change: “Instead of one long act of comedy, there will now be two long acts of comedy.” That is typical of the network 11:35 format, but Ms. Leiderman said that there would be more comedy over all, and that, unlike his competitors, Mr. Kimmel would not necessarily do a second comedy act behind his desk.“He may be staying at the monologue mark,” she said, referring to his place onstage, making his work seem like an extended monologue on some occasions.Mr. Kimmel said he might come up with yet another way to provide viewers with more of him. “I’m going to try to put on a hundred pounds through the course of the year,” he said. “That’s going to be my thing this year.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/business/global/as-crisis-drags-on-a-loss-of-hope.html,"LONDON — It would be fair to say that the American hedge-fund manager Kyle Bass does not expect the explosion in global debt in recent years to turn out well.“This ends through war,” said Mr. Bass, the founder of Hayman Capital Management in Dallas. “I don’t know who’s going to fight who, but I’m fairly certain that in the next few years you will see wars erupt, and not just small ones,” he told a recent conference.But while many investors have, like Mr. Bass, bet heavily on chaotic default in countries like Greece, three years of dogged diplomacy in Europe have so far disproved the doomsaying.And while some popular protests have erupted into violence, notably in Greece, the mystery for many analysts is why Europeans have not fought harder against increasing job losses, social spending cuts and tax increases. Unemployment in Greece and Spain has reached 25 percent.Mr. Bass bases his apocalyptic view on his calculation that credit market debt has reached 340 percent of global output. The world, he says, has never lived in peacetime with such a burden.He says some societies will not withstand the social strain when trillions of dollars of debt have to be restructured, inflicting losses on millions of investors.War in the euro zone — which Mr. Bass does not expect to survive in its present form, if at all — looks far-fetched, to put it mildly.The European political elite demonstrated in 2012 its determination to preserve the euro. Prophecies that doom has merely been delayed could well prove yet again to be wide of the mark.But it is reasonable to ask how much those caught in the cross-fire between creditors and debtors will stand for, as the euro’s battle for survival drags on.Take Portugal, now into a third year of recession, where the president has asked the Constitutional Court to rule on the legality of unprecedented tax increases.José Adelino a political scientist at Lisbon Technical University, said Portugal “got drunk on Europe” during the boom years. “Now for the first time we have the feeling that we have nowhere to go,” he said. “For 2013 the Portuguese lack a sense of mission. There is a recognition of collective powerlessness.”In other words, with scant prospect of a swift return to growth, the risk in 2013 is less of outright conflagration in the single-currency area than of a fraying of social and political ties and an insidious erosion of hope.Jean-Dominique Giuliani, who heads the Robert Schuman Foundation, a pro-European research institute in Paris, says difficult reforms must continue because the crisis shows no sign of going away.“Changes will now be constant and will demand a great deal of populations, overturn societies, surprise political leaders and unsettle experts,” he said in a commentary on his group’s Web site.Charles Robertson, chief economist at Renaissance Capital in London, is among those wondering how much more voters are prepared to sacrifice. He expects Greece to quit the euro this year and says Spain might follow by the end of 2014.Spain has already endured one year of unemployment higher than 25 percent but will probably have to manage three more to meet the financial targets set by its international creditors.“No economy (as far as we are aware) has ever sustained this unemployment rate and maintained a peg to a fixed exchange rate,” Mr. Robertson wrote in a report.Most damaging of all, he said, was the absence of hope: “For households, wages are still likely to fall to boost competitiveness. Households are deleveraging and defaulting, not borrowing more to fuel consumption.”A vibrant black market and a still-generous welfare state mean unemployment is probably sustainable at higher levels, and for longer, than ever before, Mr. Robertson acknowledged.Still, by 2014, Spanish voters will have had time to conclude that the reforms introduced by Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, whom they elected in 2011, have failed to deliver prosperity. “People may then take to the streets and demand change,” Mr. Robertson argued.Even though the consensus has swung toward the euro’s staying intact, many economists fret about the broader ramifications of protracted austerity.A possible explanation suggested by Deutsche Bank for Europe’s relative social peace to date is that the burden of adjustment has fallen disproportionately on young people.In Spain, for example, the employment rate for under-25s tumbled from 39.1 percent in mid-2007 to 18.3 percent in mid-2012, a fall of 20.8 percentage points. For those 35 to 49 years old, with a higher level of protection against layoffs, the drop over the same period was 8.9 percentage points.This mix of “youth sacrifice” and relative economic security for the bulk of the population might be why street protests have failed — except in Greece — to translate into a big shift in votes for radical parties, according to Gilles Moëc, a Deutsche Bank economist.But the potential economic cost is huge. With fewer youngsters working, Italy and Spain have seen a loss in productivity of about 2 percent, boding ill for future growth, Mr. Moëc estimated.The textbook answer is to push policies that end the divide between hard-to-fire “insiders” and typically young “outsiders” on precarious short-term contracts.The risk, however, is that these and other structural reforms become discredited because voters associate them with declining living standards and rising inequality, according to Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Center for European Reform, a research institute in London.“The consequences are likely to be far-reaching,” Mr. Tilford said. “Not only will governments struggle to push through the needed reforms, but there is a risk of a broader backlash against the market economy and the European Union,” he said.Alan Wheatley is a Reuters correspondent."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/business/global/5-billion-jolt-outlined-for-japanese-businesses.html,"TOKYO — The new Japanese government is considering programs worth ¥433 billion this week to bolster businesses, including help for them in buying foreign companies, under a draft economic stimulus package viewed by Reuters on Monday.The package of nearly $5 billion is being studied with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe making economic revival his top priority after his Liberal Democratic Party won elections last month. Mr. Abe wants to combine aggressive monetary easing — manipulation of interest rates and money supply — with government spending to encourage investment and growth.The Development Bank of Japan, a state-backed lender, would administer a ¥150 billion lending program to encourage companies to develop new technologies and collaborate on new business lines, according to the draft proposal.The stimulus package would also establish a ¥200 billion fund at the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, another state-sponsored lender, to encourage foreign mergers and takeovers. The draft showed an additional ¥83 billion in loan guarantees and low-interest-rate loans for small businesses.The government would set aside ¥100 billion for the lending program at the Development Bank of Japan in a supplemental budget; the lender would use its own capital for the remaining ¥50 billion.Government spending on the program at Japan Bank for International Cooperation would total ¥70 billion. Lending from that bank and private-sector banks would account for the remaining ¥130 billion.A Liberal Democratic Party subcommittee approved the draft Monday, and it could be approved by the cabinet as soon as this week.The total size of the government’s stimulus package could be about ¥10 trillion, with half devoted to public works, a person close to Mr. Abe said last month; the person was not authorized to speak to the news media. The draft seen Monday did not contain any details of plans for public works spending.Senior members of the Liberal Democratic Party have said they want to spend some of the stimulus to repair roads, tunnels and schools, raising concerns that the party is falling back on the excessive public works spending that was the hallmark of its more than nearly continuous governance of the country, lasting half a century.Mr. Abe’s spending promises have raised concerns that the public debt burden in Japan, already the worst among major economies, could increase further, and some economists say structural changes might have a bigger effect after years of stop-start growth. Mr. Abe has instructed the finance minister to disregard borrowing limits set by the previous government."

Holland, the first staff member of the Federal Reserve System to be appointed directly to its Board of Governors, died on Thursday at his home in Centreville, Va. He was 87.The cause was advanced dementia, his son, Timothy, said.Mr. Holland, an economist, worked in various jobs at the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago from 1949 to 1961 before moving to the system’s headquarters in Washington, where he rose to executive director. President Richard M. Nixon named him to the Board of Governors in 1973. He served until 1976.His son said Mr. Holland won the appointment because Arthur F. Burns, then the Fed chairman, believed that the board, which sets monetary policy, would benefit from having members who understood the system’s inner workings.Timothy Holland said his father resigned reluctantly in 1976 to earn more money to support three children in college or graduate school.From 1976 to 1990, Mr. Holland was the president of the Committee for Economic Development, a nonprofit group of business and academic leaders that studies policy issues. In that role, he pushed for improvements in education.Mr. Holland was a senior fellow at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania from 1990 to 2005, focusing on business ethics and work force diversity.Robert Carl Holland was born on April 7, 1925, in Tekamah, Neb. He served in the Army during World War II.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/technology/france-rejects-plan-to-block-online-ads.html,"PARIS — In a potential test case for Europe, the French government on Monday ordered a big Internet service provider to stop blocking online advertisements, saying the company had no right to edit the contents of the Web for users.The dispute has turned into a gauge of how France, and perhaps the rest of Europe, will mediate a struggle between telecommunications providers against Internet companies like Google, which generate billions of dollars in revenue from traffic that travels freely on their networks.European telecommunications companies want a share of that money, saying they need it to finance investments in faster broadband networks — and, as the latest incident shows, they are willing to flex their muscles to get it.Until now, European regulators have taken a laissez-faire approach, in contrast to the U.S. Federal Communications Commission, which has imposed guidelines barring operators of fixed-line broadband networks from blocking access to sites providing lawful content.On Monday, Fleur Pellerin, the French minister for the digital economy, said she had persuaded the Internet service provider, Free, to restore full access. The company, which has long balked at carrying the huge volume of traffic from sites owned by Google without compensation, had moved last week to block online ads when it introduced a new version of its Internet access software.“An Internet service provider cannot unilaterally implement such blocking,” Ms. Pellerin said at a news conference Monday, after meetings with online publishing and advertising groups, which had complained about a possible loss of revenue.While she acknowledged that it could be annoying “when five ads pop up on a site,” she added that advertising should not be treated differently from other kinds of content. “This kind of blocking is inconsistent with a free and open Internet, to which I am very attached.”While rejecting the initiative by Free, Ms. Pellerin said it was legitimate for the company to raise the question of who should pay for expensive network upgrades to handle growing volumes of Internet traffic.French Internet analysts said advertisements appearing on Google-owned sites or distributed by Google appeared to have been the only ones affected — fueling speculation that the move was a tactic to try to get Google to share some of its advertising revenue with Internet service providers. Google’s YouTube video-sharing site is the biggest bandwidth user among Internet companies.Google was not represented at the meetings Monday with Ms. Pellerin. In an interesting twist, its case was effectively argued by other Web publishers, including French newspapers, even though these sites, in a related dispute, are seeking their own revenue-sharing arrangement with Google. Separately, French tax collectors are also looking into the company’s fiscal practices, under which it largely avoids paying corporate taxes in France by routing its ad revenue through Ireland, which has lower rates. One proposal that has been discussed would be to use receipts from a tax on Google to support local Web sites.In yet another dispute involving Free and Google, the French telecommunications regulator is investigating complaints that the Internet provider has been discriminating against YouTube. In that case, a French consumer organization, UFC-Que Choisir, said it suspected that Free was limiting customer access to YouTube because of the high amount of bandwidth that the site consumed.Ms. Pellerin said these issues would be examined separately. Still, the timing of Free’s move raised questions, given that it came only days before a scheduled meeting among Ms. Pellerin, Internet companies and telecommunications operators to discuss the financing and regulation of new, higher-speed networks.“Should users be held hostage to these commercial negotiations? That is not obvious to me,” said Jérémie Zimmermann, a spokesman for La Quadrature du Net, a group that campaigns against restrictions on the Internet.European telecommunications companies have the right to manage the flow of Internet content that travels on their networks, by favoring, for example, tiny e-mail messages over bandwidth-heavy videos. They say such network traffic control is essential, as online video takes up ever more of their capacity, especially at peak hours.But Internet companies like Google say all traffic should be treated equally, an idea known as net neutrality.In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission in 2010 imposed regulations requiring telecommunications companies to uphold this principle, at least in general terms. The decision stemmed from fears that without rules guaranteeing net neutrality, broadband providers could favor certain Internet content and reject other material, based on business agreements or even political whims.These concerns were heightened by the unusual structure of the U.S. broadband business, in which telecommunications companies often have local monopolies or duopolies, giving consumers little choice over their provider.In Europe, by contrast, broadband competition is rampant. Regulators at the European Commission in Brussels and at the national level have said this is sufficient to prevent abuses or censorship. If one service provider were to cut off access to certain content, regulators have said, consumers could simply switch to another network.Competition has also driven down the price of access in Europe, but this means that network operators have less profit to invest in upgrades. The French government has estimated the cost of rolling out high-speed fiber-optic networks to 50 percent of the country’s territory at €25 billion, or about $33 billion, over 15 years.Some European video sharing sites have contributed to the cost of equipment that Internet service providers need to carry huge volumes of video traffic. But Google, which has maintained a studied silence throughout the dispute with Free, has balked at subsidizing Internet service providers or online publishers.UFC-Que Choisir said it hoped that the latest twist in the dispute between Free and Google had demonstrated the inadequacy of existing net neutrality protections. Instead, the group is campaigning for legislation.“More than ever, the public authorities must act in 2013 to guarantee consumers a neutral, quality Internet,” wrote Alain Bazot, the president of UFC-Que Choisir.Free, which is controlled by a French technology entrepreneur, Xavier Niel, has attracted 5.2 million broadband customers, roughly 25 percent of the French market, with a €20-a-month offer that undercut established providers like France Télécom, the former national phone monopoly. It is the second-largest broadband provider in France, after France Télécom.While Mr. Niél is considered an outsider in French business circles, he drew closer to the establishment two years ago when, with two business partners, he bought a controlling stake in the newspaper Le Monde.Free declined to comment on the meeting with Ms. Pellerin, who hinted that the company might still get something out of the dispute, despite her order to restore advertising.“What is the financial incentive for operators to invest billions in their networks without seeing any return?” she said. “We have to put in place a win-win system.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/science/space/in-ancient-meteorite-hint-there-was-life-on-mars.html,"A meteorite found in the Sahara, one of the oldest ever to come from Mars, offers evidence that life could have existed there more than two billion years ago, researchers say.The 0.7-pound fragment contains more water than any other known Martian meteorite. “It’s about 6,000 parts per million of water,” said Carl B. Agee, a planetary scientist at the University of New Mexico who led the study. “That’s the water locked into the mineral structure of the meteorite.”By comparison, there are more than 100 other known meteorites from Mars, and most have a water content of 200 parts per million.  The new findings were published online by the journal Science.The meteorite contains organic carbon similar to that found in other Martian meteorites. But it is 10 times as old, dating from the early part of the most recent geologic epoch on Mars, called the Amazonian. Most other meteorites from Mars are about 200 million years old. The meteorite most likely came from an explosive volcano, Dr. Agee said.Its unusual composition — cemented fragments of basalt — is consistent with observations made by recent Martian rovers and orbiters.This led researchers to conclude that the meteorite came from the planet’s crust. The water captured in the meteorite may have come from underground water or surface waters near the explosion, Dr. Agee said.“The sample may give us an idea of what volcanic activity was like then, but it also gives us a glimpse of what the surface of Mars was like at that time,” he said, adding that the abundance of water “suggests that it’s within the realm of possibility that life could have existed 2.1 billion years ago.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/business/global/belgium-investigates-lvmh.html,"PARIS — Federal prosecutors in Brussels have opened an investigation into the Belgian financial activities of LVMH, the luxury giant controlled by the French mogul Bernard Arnault, who is seeking citizenship in that country.The investigation, confirmed Friday by a spokeswoman for the Belgian Federal Justice Ministry, could provide a rare look into the affairs of Mr. Arnault, one the world’s wealthiest individuals. Mr. Arnault controls LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton and its portfolio of luxury brands, including Dior, through a complicated network of companies that makes it difficult to ascertain the actual ownership structure.The investigation was first reported Friday by De Morgen, a Flemish newspaper.Because Mr. Arnault is seeking Belgian citizenship, the justice authorities had been asked to weigh in with an opinion on his fitness. According to De Morgen, the investigation followed from that review, with officials looking into suggestions that LVMH might have used a network of Belgian subsidiaries to avoid taxes.Geneviève Seressia, the Justice Ministry spokeswoman, said ministry officials had recommended against Mr. Arnault’s application because he had been unable to prove that his principal residence for the past three years had been in Belgium. She declined to comment further on the case.Mr. Arnault is not the only well-known Frenchman to seek foreign citizenship lately. Last week Gérard Depardieu, the actor and businessman, received a Russian passport from Vladimir V. Putin. Mr. Depardieu has complained that his tax burden in France grew too large under the government of François Hollande, which hopes to set the top marginal income tax rate at 75 percent.The country’s Immigration Service had already returned a negative reply on Mr. Arnault’s application. The Belgian State Security Service is also expected to render an opinion. But the final decision will be in the hands of a parliamentary naturalization commission, which is not required to abide by the recommendations.“This is just a step in the procedure that doesn’t at all prejudge the final decision of the Belgian naturalization commission,” Olivier Labesse, a spokesman for Mr. Arnault said, adding that the decision was expected this spring. “Bernard Arnault remains a French citizen,” he said, “and he pays his taxes in France.”Mr. Arnault, 63, has never explained exactly why he is seeking Belgian citizenship. But having a Belgian passport might allow his heirs to keep LVMH intact on his death, rather than, as might be the case in France, having to break the company up to pay inheritance taxes.Last year, Mr. Arnault was ranked by Forbes magazine  as the world’s fourth-wealthiest person with a fortune estimated at $41 billion, behind Carlos Slim Helú, Bill Gates and Warren E. Buffett."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/nyregion/gilberto-valle-officer-held-in-kidnapping-plot-balks-at-jail-transfer.html,"Gilberto Valle, the New York police officer charged with plotting to kidnap, kill and eat women, had been held in a special unit of the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan, separated from other prisoners, apparently for his own protection.But his already bizarre case took an unusual turn on Friday, when his lawyer, Julia L. Gatto, went to court and complained to a judge that without her knowledge, Mr. Valle had been given a cellmate, “a bunkie,” she said.And not just any bunkie, she told the judge, Paul G. Gardephe, of Federal District Court in Manhattan. “The individual they housed him with is a purported member of the Latin Kings, which is not an organization known to love law enforcement,” she said.That match apparently did not last. The Bureau of Prisons moved Mr. Valle to a jail in Brooklyn, where he was told he would be placed in the general prisoner population, Ms. Gatto said.“Given the notoriety of this case and Mr. Valle’s known status as former law enforcement,” Ms. Gatto told the judge in a letter, “we are deeply troubled that the B.O.P. would place him in general population.”The developments come less than two weeks before the scheduled trial of Mr. Valle, who has been accused of plotting crimes through instant messages and e-mails that he exchanged with conspirators. Prosecutors say he also took “concrete steps” to further his plans, including conducting surveillance on a woman he had agreed to kidnap. Ms. Gatto contends her client was merely playing out dark fantasies on Web sites that are used by thousands of people.In court, a prosecutor, Hadassa Waxman, said that jail officials had told her Mr. Valle showed signs of depression, and that in the Brooklyn jail, he was to have been placed in a small, general-population unit that offered a greater degree of psychiatric support.Ms. Gatto, who has sought unsuccessfully to have her client released on bail, said he wanted to return to his solitary cell in Manhattan “so he can focus on the case and not be disturbed or concerned about his safety.”Judge Gardephe later ordered that Mr. Valle be held in the Metropolitan Correctional Center through the end of trial. A Bureau of Prisons spokeswoman said the agency does not comment on an inmate’s confinement conditions."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/business/global/greek-lawmakers-back-tax-increase.html,"ATHENS — Greek lawmakers voted late Friday to increase taxes on middle- to high-income earners, self-employed professionals and businesses despite vehement objections by the political opposition and several ruling coalition deputies who said austerity-weary citizens should not be subjected to further pain.The change to the tax code, one of a long line of pledges Greece has made to international creditors in exchange for continued bailout money, passed comfortably with at least 162 of the ruling coalition’s 163 members backing the articles in a roll call that came after two days of heated debate in the 300-seat Parliament.The fragile coalition government of Prime Minister Antonis Samaras hopes to raise 2.3 billion euros in much-needed revenue from the new law, which increases the amount of income tax paid by those earning more than 20,000 euros a year, trims tax benefits for having children, revokes tax breaks for farmers and increases corporate tax to 26 percent from 20 percent. The new law also increases the amount of income tax paid by self-employed professionals like doctors and electricians, who are widely perceived as not paying their share by understating their income. New rules abolishing a tax-exempt threshold means the self-employed would be taxed from the first euro they earn.Defending the bill in Parliament, Finance Minister Yannis Stournaras called it “a vital fiscal reform” that would avert additional across-the-board cuts to workers and pensioners.“Every euro collected in tax revenue is one euro saved from salaries, pensions and social benefits,” he said. He rejected a flurry of amendments from members of two junior parties in the coalition and the opposition, noting that such costly changes would throw Greece off the path to economic health and put further bailout money in jeopardy.Calling Mr. Stournaras a “political terrorist,” Panagiotis Lafazanis, a lawmaker of the leftist party Syriza, which opposes the terms of Greece’s bailouts, said the tax bill was “the nail in the coffin of social justice,” adding that “Greek society is more important” than its creditors.Other opposition lawmakers berated the government for planning to impose additional measures in the coming days, including tighter control of the budgets of ministries and state utilities, the reduction of parliamentary employees’ wages in line with cuts to the wages of other civil servants, and the revision of Greece’s second loan agreement with foreign creditors, in the form of special edicts that do not require parliamentary approval. The loan agreement amendment surrenders the country’s rights to protect its assets from creditors, Syriza complained.Since 2010, the European Union and the International Monetary Fund have committed to two bailouts for Greece worth 240 billion euros in exchange for austerity measures that have hurt Greek living standards, pushed unemployment close to 27 percent and fueled angry street protests.The new law is to be followed in spring by a thorough overhaul of the tax system that will introduce jail terms for large-scale evaders instead of the suspended sentences handed down now.Greece’s failure to crack down on widespread tax evasion came into sharp focus over the holidays after prosecutors revealed that the names of three relatives of the former finance minister George Papaconstantinou had been removed from a list of some 2,000 wealthy Greeks with Swiss bank accounts. Parliament is to vote next Thursday on whether Mr. Papaconstantinou, and his successor as finance minister, Evangelos Venizelos, who leads the coalition’s Socialist party, will face a parliamentary inquiry on whether they should be indicted on charges of criminal tampering and breach of duty."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/us/trial-begins-for-mohamed-osman-mohamud.html,"PORTLAND, Ore. — A defense lawyer for a 21-year-old Somali-American told a federal jury here on Friday that his client did in fact push a cellphone button on a night in late November 2010 believing he was detonating a truck bomb that would kill hundreds or thousands of people who had gathered to watch downtown Portland’s Christmas lights come on.“Not disputed,” said the lawyer, Stephen R. Sady. “That all happened.”The larger question, Mr. Sady told the jury, is how the defendant, Mohamed Osman Mohamud, got to that moment. That no one was harmed and that the bomb was a fake — built by F.B.I. technicians to mimic a crude explosive, accurate in its details right down to the smell of diesel fuel that filled the van housing it — were just the backdrop, he said, to a story of psychology and manipulation by undercover agents who went too far setting up an elaborate sting against a confused young man.“Did the government create the crime?” he asked in opening statements in Mr. Mohamud’s trial on a charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. “Did the F.B.I. foil its own plot?”In the government’s opening remarks, a federal prosecutor told the jurors that mental attitude was the key element to watch in following the evidence. But Pamala R. Holsinger, the assistant United States attorney, said the hours of tapes and videos leading up to the moment of attack, which the jurors will hear in court, would reveal not manipulation by undercover agents. Instead, they would show a deliberate, vehement intent to kill by a young man who had embraced violent religious extremism.She said that Mr. Mohamud devised the bomb attack, intended to achieve the most casualties, and that F.B.I. operatives gave him opportunity after opportunity to change his mind.The estimated 25,000 people gathered that night for the tree lighting ceremony might not have been in genuine physical danger, Ms. Holsinger said, but that was only because federal agents prevented Mr. Mohamud from connecting with real terrorists who would have helped him create a real bomb. The intent was what mattered, she said, and it was real, and criminal.“He plotted and schemed,” she said, and his goal for the people that night was unquestioned: “to kill each and every one of them.”She said the defendant was confronted by the undercover agents at one point with the reality that many children would perhaps be killed. “Yeah, that’s what I’m looking for,” Ms. Holsinger quoted Mr. Mohamud as saying.Mr. Mohamud, a former engineering student at Oregon State University who was born in Somalia but raised largely in Oregon’s suburbs, faces up to life in prison if convicted.The trial is expected to last about five weeks. But if the day-and-a-half-long jury selection was a measure, other issues beyond evidence could color the case.Several potential jurors who were dismissed by Senior District Judge Garr M. King said, for example, they believed that police authorities sometimes deliberately entrap innocent people in criminal stings. Another dismissed juror, asked about any biases she might bring to the case, said the number of federal prosecutors and assistants in the courtroom — overwhelming in contrast to Mr. Mohamud’s small team of public defenders — illustrated what she said were the government’s overwhelming resources, all brought to bear against one man.Portlanders, heavily represented in the jury pool, are not uniformly liberal, but the city’s political culture often seems to be, with its concerns about social justice and cultural acceptance of differences in ethnicity, gender and sexual orientation. Left-leaning suspicions of government authority, like the ones that erupted last year over a plan to fluoridate the city’s water supply, are often not so different from right-leaning suspicions.But the vast potential scale of the would-be attack, as well as its location and timing at — a holiday event where many families and children gathered at a time associated with peace on earth — also put a stamp on the trial. Pioneer Courthouse Square, a cherished downtown communal space only a few blocks from the federal courthouse, is full on most days with people strolling, reading and eating lunch. And some prospective jurors said that they knew families who were in the square at the Christmas tree ceremony in 2010 when Mr. Mohamud was arrested."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/business/information-technology-dividends-surge-past-consumer-staples-sector.html,"FOR what appears to be the first time ever, information technology companies in the Standard & Poor’s index of 500 stocks are paying more in dividends than companies in any other sector, S.&P. reported this week.S.&P. Dow Jones Indices reported that in 2012 the technology sector accounted for 14.7 percent of all dividends paid to investors in the 500 companies, up from 10.3 percent in 2011 and from a little over 5 percent back in 2004. It replaced the consumer staples sector, which had been the largest payer of dividends for the previous three years.The change was largely because of the decision by Apple, now the most valuable company in the world, to begin paying dividends last year. The company had been public for more than three decades before it announced plans in March to begin making payouts. Four other technology companies in the index — all but one of which had been public for more than two decades without paying a dividend — later joined in making payments to shareholders.With those changes, 60 percent — 42 — of the 70 technology stocks in the index are now dividend payers. The dividends from many technology companies are relatively small, however, and of the other sectors, only health care comes close to having as large a share of companies that do not pay dividends.But a few years ago, the idea that most technology companies would choose to pay dividends rather than hold profits to be reinvested, would have seemed highly unlikely. In 1999, when the technology stock bubble was nearing an end, companies that paid dividends were generally viewed as boring and growth companies as exciting. Over all, the S.& P. 500 index rose 20 percent that year, but the stocks that paid dividends were up only 4 percent. A portfolio composed only of big companies that did not pay dividends would have risen 90 percent.The stocks in the S.& P. 500 are generally the largest and most widely held stocks in the country. S.& P. estimates that this year they will pay nearly three-quarters of all dividends paid by American companies. The accompanying chart shows information on the three sectors that have been the largest payers in at least one of the last nine years — and provides a cautionary warning about the risks of buying stocks solely because they pay high dividends.The financial sector was the largest dividend payer by far in the years leading up to the financial crisis, and those dividends were more than supported by reported profits. But those profits vanished at many of the companies, and so did the dividends. The sector went from providing nearly 30 percent of all S.& P. 500 dividends in 2006 and 2007 to providing about 9 percent of them in 2009 and 2010. That figure is now back to more than 12 percent, and will continue to rise if the Federal Reserve lets big banks increase dividends, as many want to do."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/your-money/taxes/coping-with-the-new-tax-law-even-for-the-richest-of-the-rich.html,"WHILE the affluent will pay more in taxes this year, that is probably not the case for the very wealthiest — those worth hundreds of millions or more. They may still be paying a lower tax rate than Warren Buffett’s secretary.Many millionaires are certainly paying at least 30 percent of their income in taxes, a goal President Obama set out in last year’s State of the Union address. But they’re more likely to be doctors, lawyers and people working in the financial services industry who get the bulk of their earnings in the form of paychecks.Partners in private equity firms and hedge fund managers, on the other hand, earn much of their money as a share of their funds’ earnings. And that income gets preferential tax treatment as so-called carried interest.A similar special tax treatment still holds true for Mr. Buffett as long as the bulk of his income comes from his investments and not a paycheck. The long-term capital gains rate for incomes over $400,000 is 23.8 percent, including the Medicare surcharge. That’s a far cry from the top marginal tax rate on income above that amount of 40.5 percent, which includes a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on earned income.How are people going to react to all of this? Here is advice and observations from some experts in wealth management:INCOME ISSUES This year, income taxes are going up for almost everyone, even if the taxes go by different names. Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young and a contributing author to the firm’s tax guide, laid out five tiers where taxes are increasing.The bottom one includes everyone who receives a paycheck and is affected by the 2 percentage point increase in the payroll tax. In the top one are couples making more than $450,000 a year, who will pay higher rates on income and investments, be subject to the Medicare surcharges of 0.9 percent on income and 3.8 percent on investments and lose some portion of their itemized deductions and exemptions.Using assumptions on wages and deductions from Internal Revenue Service statistics, Mr. Rosica calculated that a person making $500,000 a year would pay $9,124, or 7 percent, more in taxes in 2013. A couple earning $1 million a year in wages and business and investment income would pay $53,350 extra, or 20 percent more in taxes.“It’s hitting every line item of income,” he said. “It’s phasing in all the way up the scale.” This has made strategies that defer income more attractive than they were in the years when George W. Bush was president and tax rates were historically low. “At the base level, it’s 401(k) plans. Or, for the self-employed person or person who sits on boards, they can defer into a SEP I.R.A.,” a retirement plan for the self-employed, or into one’s own defined-benefit plan, said Christopher Zander, the national head of wealth planning at Evercore Wealth Management. “That’s very attractive. Even if income tax rates are higher later, I think the tax deferral” makes up for that increase.There are risks, though. People could defer too much into a qualified plan, like an I.R.A., and end up having to pay a penalty if they need the money before they turn 59 1/2 years old. Or they could put too much into a company-sponsored deferred-compensation plan and face two problems. The company could go bankrupt, as Lehman Brothers did, and they could lose that money, or the payout schedule they selected when they put the money in — say 10 annual payments at retirement — may end up providing them with too much or too little income.CARRIED-INTEREST CONUNDRUM At the very top of the income ladder, the group for whom the changes in the tax code will not hurt as much includes people like hedge fund managers and private equity partners whose earnings come in the form of carried interest. The income for these people comes from the fees they charge, and that income will continue to be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.“Carried interest rules are helpful for hedge fund managers, but they’re incredibly helpful for private equity guys,” said Richard A. Rosenberg, a certified public accountant and co-founder of RR Advisory Group, which advises hedge fund and private equity partners. “Private equity funds typically get the stronger treatment because there is less turnover and the holding periods of the funds are longer.”How the partners’ share is taxed depends on how the underlying investments are taxed. In the case of private equity, many of the investments are held for longer than a year. Through last year, the distributions would have been taxed at the long-term capital gains rate, which was 15 percent. Even now, the rate is still a relatively low 20 percent for an individual earning above $400,000.In the case of a hedge fund, the earnings are probably a combination of various rates, like short- and long-term capital gains, dividend and interest income, with capital losses factored in. Still, the rate on the carried interest is likely to be lower than the rate paid by someone who earns a high salary.But for individuals who invest in private equity and hedge funds, the tax situation will be worse. Since they have little control over when those managers buy and sell things — and at what rate those investments get taxed — advisers said that it may be more beneficial to own those investments in tax-deferred accounts.SMALL BUSINESS BURDENS Despite what both political parties say about the importance of small-business owners for creating jobs, the new tax rates will adversely effect everyone whose businesses are set up so their earnings flow through to their individual income tax returns.J. Leigh Griffith, a lawyer and partner at Waller, a national law firm based in Nashville, said many in this group would be paying taxes at a higher marginal rate than big corporations like I.B.M. and General Electric. He said about half of all companies today were structured as so-called pass-through entities.“Both parties have talked about how our corporate rate of 35 percent, which is the highest in the developed world, puts us at a competitive disadvantage,” Mr. Griffith said. But we take a 35 percent bracket on pass-through business entities and raise it to 39.6 percent plus the investment tax.”While he said it was too early to quantify the impact this will have, these business owners will probably have to pay higher rates of interest to borrow money. And some business owners may become frustrated and look to shelter more money from taxes. While many legitimate vehicles exist, like profit-sharing plans or defined-benefit plans, he said he was concerned that some small-business owners would turn to tax avoidance schemes.He said this year was only eight days old when he heard of the first tax shelter linking itself to the new law (which was signed on Jan. 2): it was an offer to invest in a film with a 100 percent tax write-off on the investment — and a producer credit.INVESTING WITH TAXES IN MIND In an ideal world, taxes would be seen as a way to raise revenue for necessary services and wouldn’t prompt people to change their behavior to avoid them. But this isn’t an ideal world.Beyond risky tax shelters, there are other, seemingly sensible investments that, when overdone, can also have adverse effects on any long-term investment plan. The interest payments on municipal bonds are tax-free, but not every city or service that issues municipal bonds is equally solid. And municipal bonds are still subject to capital gains tax when sold.Seth J. Finkel, managing director at Neuberger Berman Wealth Management, said some clients were looking at investing in master-limited partnerships — many of which operate pipelines — because they are not taxed at the corporate level and the dividends are structured so the entire amount is not subject to tax. But there is an inherent risk in anything that relies on transporting natural resources because demand can vary.“We want to look at the bottom line and not make bad decisions,” Mr. Finkel said. “But taxes do matter.” For people with large holdings of stock that have appreciated greatly over the year and are subject to a 23.8 percent tax, Mr. Zander said there was the temptation to put those shares into exchange funds — essentially a pool of other highly appreciated stock — or buy so-called collars that keep the price within a particular range.“Many times, the decision becomes to sell outright, even though rates are higher,” Mr. Zander said. “There’s immediate diversification and less administrative hassle.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/us/politics/democrats-urge-obama-to-take-any-lawful-steps-to-avoid-default.html,"WASHINGTON — The Democratic leadership in the Senate asked President Obama on Friday to take “any lawful steps” available to avoid a default on the nation’s debt if Republicans continue to press their demand that an increase in the government’s borrowing limit be accompanied by spending cuts of the same magnitude.“In the event that Republicans make good on their threat by failing to act, or by moving unilaterally to pass a debt-limit extension only as part of unbalanced or unreasonable legislation, we believe you must be willing to take any lawful steps to ensure that America does not break its promises and trigger a global economic crisis — without Congressional approval, if necessary,” wrote Senators Harry Reid of Nevada, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, Charles E. Schumer of New York and Patty Murray of Washington.The letter signaled an escalation in the war of words over the federal debt ceiling, which has already technically been breached, leaving the Treasury Department scrambling to meet the government’s domestic and foreign obligations. Lawmakers believe the bookkeeping flexibility will be exhausted by Feb. 15, at which time Washington would have to either default on its debt or shut down major expenditures.Already, liberal policy experts have been trying to rally support for measures to go around the Republican blockade, from declaring that the Constitution’s 14th Amendment gives the president unilateral authority to raise the debt ceiling to calling for the minting of a trillion-dollar platinum coin that would be used to pay the nation’s debts.“All Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike, have a stake in ensuring that our country meets its legal obligations,” the Democratic leaders wrote. “Financial markets have long viewed securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States as the most trustworthy in the world. This lowers borrowing costs for homes, cars, and college for all Americans and strengthens our economy. If we violate that trust for the first time in history, we will never fully regain it, and every American will suffer.”Mr. Obama has said he will not negotiate on raising the government’s statutory borrowing limit, but without some extralegal maneuver, it is not clear how he can keep that promise. The House speaker, John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, has not backed down on his demand that any increase in the debt limit include cuts at least equal in scope, and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has also said the debt ceiling issue must be used to secure spending reductions.“Senate Democrats cannot ignore their responsibilities for political convenience — and the American people will not tolerate an increase in the debt limit without spending cuts and reforms,” said Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner.Conservative Republicans say that even without an increase in the debt ceiling, the administration could continue to pay foreign and domestic creditors by ensuring that incoming tax receipts go first to paying off debts. To do that, however, huge and immediate cuts in government spending would be necessary, and global financial markets would almost certainly be rattled.The Senate Democratic leaders did not suggest what “lawful steps” they had in mind. A Democratic aide said the senators would be inclined to have the president declare unilateral authority under the 14th Amendment, which says the debt’s validity “shall not be questioned.”That, the aide said, would be more politically tenable than using the loophole of a trillion-dollar coin, issued under a legal provision that allows the Treasury to mint a platinum coin of any denomination. The coin would be deposited at the Federal Reserve, which in theory would then issue a line of credit against it.But Democrats worry that the coin option would baffle voters. According to officials familiar with the drafting of the letter, top aides to Mr. Reid, the Senate majority leader, initially favored an explicit reference to the 14th Amendment. But in negotiations over the wording of their letter, the leaders opted for strategic ambiguity, to keep Republicans guessing and the president’s options open.One of the main reasons for the letter was to bolster the president’s resolve, Senate aides said. In 2011, Mr. Obama dismissed the 14th Amendment option, telling reporters that his lawyers “are not persuaded that that is a winning argument.” This week when asked about the coin, the White House spokesman, Jay Carney, said, “There is no Plan B, there is no backup plan. There is Congress’s responsibility to pay the bills of the United States.”Democratic leadership aides said the Senate would probably take up legislation in early February that would allow the president to raise the debt ceiling on his own in set increments, perhaps of $1 trillion. Congress would have the ability to reject the increase, but that would take a two-thirds majority.That plan was first used at the suggestion of Senator McConnell in 2011 to solve the last debt-ceiling impasse. Late last year, Mr. McConnell proposed it on the Senate floor again, but when Democrats called his bluff, he reversed course and blocked his own proposal."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/sports/football/patriots-defense-cooks-up-turnovers.html,"FOXBOROUGH, Mass. — They don’t dominate or intimidate. All they do is give you a little wiggle room — and then make you look bad. Sometimes really, really bad.The New England Patriots’ offense simply overpowers its opponent. The defense? It is a veritable turnover machine, which helps explain why the Patriots are one home victory from the A.F.C. championship game despite defensive numbers that must make Coach Bill Belichick cringe.The pass defense, once again, was one of the worst in the N.F.L. in terms of yards allowed. But it was better than last season. New England’s rushing defense ranked seventh, mainly because so many teams had to play catch-up that they all but abandoned the running game.The Patriots allowed 20.7 points a game, tied for ninth in the N.F.L. It’s not great, but it, too, is an upgrade from last season.But no team in the conference came remotely close to the Patriots’ ability to force turnovers this season. New England pretty much lapped the conference with a differential of plus-25. The Patriots’ opponent in Sunday’s divisional game, the Houston Texans, was No. 2 in the A.F.C. Their differential was a plus-12.The Patriots forced 41 turnovers over 16 games, with at least one in every game. (They have forced a turnover in 27 straight games.) Only the Chicago Bears, with 44 forced turnovers, had more. But the Bears’ differential of plus-20 still trailed the Patriots, who also led the N.F.L. in turnover differential in 2010. They were third last season, but led the A.F.C.New England’s opportunistic defense recovered 21 fumbles and had 20 interceptions, including three in the end zone by defensive back Devin McCourty. Both of those numbers led the A.F.C. The 21 fumble recoveries led the league. The Bears, the Redskins and the Giants each had more than 20 interceptions.“It’s taking advantage of your opportunities,” Belichick said this week. “If you have an opportunity to get it, then you need to get it. We practice them and hopefully when we get the opportunity, we can capitalize and make those count. Those are opportunities; you only get so many of them on defense. You need to capitalize on whichever ones you get.”It started with the season opener at Tennessee (one fumble recovery and one interception) and continued through the regular-season finale, a 28-0 victory over Miami (one interception). But the apex had to be against the Jets on Thanksgiving. The Patriots forced a Shonn Greene fumble that was recovered by Steve Gregory, setting in motion a chain of events that led to 21 points in 52 seconds.Gregory’s recovery led to one touchdown. A second fumble, by Mark Sanchez, was picked up by Gregory and returned for a touchdown. On the ensuing kickoff, McCourty forced a fumble that was returned for a touchdown by Julian Edelman.The Patriots got five touchdowns from their defense — three fumbles and two interceptions. McCourty led the Patriots with five interceptions; the five were the best in the A.F.C. along with Buffalo’s Jairus Byrd. One of McCourty’s three end-zone interceptions came in the Dec. 10 game against Houston, won easily by the Patriots, 42-14. The rookie safety Tavon Wilson had four interceptions, one more than he had in his collegiate career at Illinois.“The biggest thing is just trying to read the quarterback and go from there,” McCourty said this week. “It sounds simple, but at different times against quarterbacks in this league, sometimes they do a good job of looking you off and doing different things like that. It’s just trying to read the quarterback.” He added that Belichick “is big on telling on us, ‘Just do your job.’ ”Takeaways are a big part of the job description for the Patriots. In the last three seasons, they have had turnover differentials of plus-25, plus-17 and plus-28. Since their first Super Bowl victory, after the 2001 season, the Patriots have been in the plus category in turnovers in every season but one.This season, they had the most fumbles caused since 1985. Rob Ninkovich, who moved to defensive end from his linebacker slot, forced five fumbles, as did linebacker Brandon Spikes. That was the most by a Patriots player in 20 years (Mike Vrabel also had five in 2007). Chandler Jones, one of three rookies to start on defense, forced three. He also had 6 of the team’s 37 sacks, while his fellow rookie defender Dont’a Hightower had four.You can bank on a few certainties on Sunday. The Patriots will defer if they win the coin toss. Tom Brady will throw a touchdown pass. Someone on the defense will come up with a turnover. Maybe even more than one."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/world/middleeast/palestinians-set-up-camp-in-israeli-occupied-west-bank-territory.html,"JERUSALEM — Adopting a tactic more commonly employed by Jewish settlers who establish wildcat outposts in the West Bank, scores of Palestinian activists erected tents on Friday in a hotly contested piece of Israeli-occupied West Bank territory known as E1, and they said they intended to stay put.The Palestinians claim E1, just east of Jerusalem, as part of a future state. The protest comes six weeks after Israel announced that it was moving forward with plans for thousands of settlement homes in E1, stirring international outrage.The Israeli military authorities arrived Friday and handed the protesters notices warning them that they were illegally trespassing and that they had to leave, according to a police spokesman, Micky Rosenfeld. Mr. Rosenfeld said he expected movement “at some point,” with the protesters either leaving voluntarily or by force.But the protesters said that they had anticipated such action by Israeli security forces and that their lawyers had already gone to the Israeli Supreme Court to argue for a delay in any evacuation until the state details the grounds for such a move. Protest leaders said the court had given the state six days to respond.About 200 activists began pitching tents on a hill in the barren, stony territory on Friday morning, and issued a statement announcing the establishment of a village named Bab al-Shams (Arabic for “Gate of the Sun”), after the title of a novel by a Lebanese writer, Elias Khoury, that portrays Palestinian yearnings through a metaphorical story of love for the land.Israeli plans to build in E1 have been vehemently opposed for years by international players, including the United States, who say construction there would partially separate the northern and southern West Bank, harming the prospects of a viable contiguous Palestinian state in that territory. Israel announced its intention as a countermeasure after the United Nations General Assembly voted in November to upgrade the Palestinians’ status to that of a nonmember observer state.Israel wants to create contiguity between East Jerusalem, which it has annexed, and the large urban settlement of Maale Adumim that lies beyond E1, and says that the future of the West Bank has to be settled in negotiations. In the meantime, critics say, Israel continues to establish facts on the ground.“We are here as a response to the settlers and to the Israeli policy of settlement expansion,” said Muhammad Khatib, a veteran member of the grass-roots Palestinian Popular Struggle Coordination Committee and a resident of Bilin. That West Bank village became a symbol of Palestinian defiance after it held weekly protests and won a ruling in the Israeli Supreme Court in 2007 forcing Israel to reroute its West Bank barrier so as to take in less of the village’s agricultural land.“Now I am one of the people of Bab al-Shams,” said Mr. Khatib, speaking by telephone from the protest site. “We want to stay here forever.”Mr. Khatib said that the police were stopping people and supplies from entering the site, but that the campers had come prepared. He added that if the Israeli security forces came to evict the protesters, “we will resist in our nonviolent way.”Israel says that most of the E1 area is Israeli land. Protest leaders said they had set up their encampment on a parcel of land owned by a Palestinian family from A-Tur, a neighborhood of East Jerusalem. They added that the landowners had given their full permission for the encampment and had joined the activists at the site.About 25 tents were set up Friday, including one serving as a clinic and one for the “village administration,” according to Abir Kopty, a spokeswoman for the coordination committee, who also spoke by phone from the encampment.“We call this a village, not an outpost,” Ms. Kopty said, “because there is a huge difference between Palestinians living on their own land and settlers building illegally on our occupied land.”Hanan Ashrawi, a member of the Palestine Liberation Organization’s executive committee, said in a statement: “This initiative is a highly creative and legitimate nonviolent tool to protect our land from Israeli colonial plans. We have the right to live anywhere in our state, and we call upon the international community to support such initiatives.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/business/economic-experts-give-predictions-for-2013.html,"To many politicians, the deal that raised taxes on the wealthy and averted the fiscal cliff was a sellout, a cop-out, a Band-Aid — in short, nothing good. And now the debt ceiling showdown is looming. So why have stock investors cheered, pushing the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index to five-year highs?My annual survey suggests that investment experts are cautiously upbeat about the economy and the stock market (but not bonds) for 2013, even though they acknowledge that political dysfunction in Washington poses risks. The tax deal may have upset Tea Party Republicans looking for big cuts in entitlement spending and liberals demanding even bigger tax increases on the wealthy. But investors seem to be taking the long view that the warring factions did in the end reach a deal, and it amounts to a $4 trillion stimulus compared with what would have happened if Congress had done nothing. Stimulus may be a bad word in Washington, but many investors seem to believe that continued deficit spending and only a modest tax increase will be good for the economy and corporate profits, at least this year.The experts I consulted a year ago — Bill Miller for stocks, Bill Gross for bonds and Karl E. Case for real estate — proved accurate in their predictions for 2012. So I asked them for a return engagement. I also spoke to Byron Wien, vice chairman and a senior adviser at Blackstone. Last year, Mr. Wien was one of the few pundits who was exactly right about the stock market, predicting that the S.& P. 500 would close the year “over 1,400.” The index ended the year at 1,426, a gain of 13.4 percent for the year.Bill Miller: ‘The great bond bear market has begun’ Perhaps the biggest comeback of 2012 belongs to Mr. Miller of Legg Mason, who became a mutual fund legend by beating the S.& P. 500 for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005. Then, during 2008 and the financial panic, he seemingly lost his magic touch. His fund plunged 55 percent. The Wall Street Journal, in its headline about the fund’s dismal returns, spoke of his “defeat.” And after another disappointing year in 2011, he retired as head of the Legg Mason Value Trust, the firm’s flagship fund.But Mr. Miller kept his hand in the market, managing the much smaller Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity Trust. When I sought him out a year ago, reasoning that even the most brilliant investors can be expected to have a few bad years, he was bullish on stocks. That proved good advice. Mr. Miller’s fund gained over 40 percent in 2012, and was the top-performing mutual fund in Morningstar’s database. How did he do it?Mr. Miller made big bets on the battered and out-of-favor homebuilding and financial sectors, the kind of contrarian strategy that served him well for so many years. Major holdings like Pulte Homes (which gained 160 percent over the past year) and Bank of America (which nearly doubled) were some his best-performing stocks.Mr. Miller remains optimistic about stocks for 2013, with an asterisk. When I reached him this week, he offered these predictions: “The great bond bear market has begun, starting with Treasuries, which should see years of losses as interest rates gradually normalize. Equities, which outperformed bonds in 2012, will continue to do well, driven by rising earnings, strong free cash flow, solid profit margins, low inflation and attractive valuation relative to bonds. The path of least resistance for stocks and the economy is higher. The chief risk is the dysfunctional political environment, which could derail what otherwise is a very promising outlook.”Mr. Wien, whose long career on Wall Street included stints at Morgan Stanley and Pequot Capital, told me he’s “gloomy” about prospects in Washington. “We can’t solve our problems simply by getting the rich to pay more. We have to broaden the tax base, revise the tax code and tackle the structural problems we aren’t facing. We need to deal with entitlements. The latest deal did absolutely nothing to address that. I don’t know if democracy can solve these problems.”Despite his success at predicting the market last year, Mr. Wien isn’t putting a number on the S.& P. 500 this year, but his expectations are modest. He expects the S.& P. 500 to test 1,300 at some point, which would be about a 10 percent decline from current levels, before ending the year about where it is now. “I don’t expect the stock market to do much this year,” he said. “Most analysts are forecasting returns of 10 percent or more, but I think earnings could be down for the year, which would make it hard for the market to gain that much.”But he’s optimistic about stock markets in some other countries, especially China, where stocks lagged last year, and Japan, which has been in the doldrums for years. He’s forecasting a 20 percent gain this year for Chinese shares. Bill Gross:  ‘Ashes in our stocking’After a rough 2011, Mr. Gross, the highly regarded bond expert and a founder of the investment firm Pimco, bounced back last year. Pimco’s Total Return Fund, which Mr. Gross manages, returned over 10 percent in 2012, a year when short-term Treasury bonds were yielding close to zero. A year ago, he told me that tax-free municipal bonds, which he termed a “deserted” asset class because of widespread fears of municipal bankruptcies, would provide healthy returns. He was right: municipal bond returns averaged over 7 percent last year, and some bonds earned double-digit returnsBut Mr. Gross is far more muted now. “I’m afraid there are going to be ashes in our stocking this year,” he said, “and that applies to almost all asset classes. Bonds are priced not just for perfection, but with close to 0 percent yields. The juice has been squeezed out of the orange. You just can’t get to 10 percent returns.”Will 2013 be the year that interest rates in the United States finally start to rise, which could devastate returns for fixed-income investors? (Bond prices move inversely to interest rates.) A growing number of experts (including Mr. Miller) think so, but not Mr. Gross. “I don’t see a lot of risk in bonds,” Mr. Gross said. “The Federal Reserve is buying, and there’s no real risk until the Fed declares the war is over. It’s looking for 6.5 percent unemployment. By any reasonable standard, that’s going to be a long time coming — certainly not in 2013, and probably not for at least two to three more years.”Mr. Gross likes bonds from emerging market countries as well as from Italy and Spain. And for conservative investors who prize safety, he recommends Treasury Inflation Protected Bonds, or TIPs, even though their nominal yields are minuscule. “I like countries like Brazil and Mexico especially,” he said. “They have half the debt the United States does relative to G.D.P. They have much better growth prospects. Mexican bonds yield about 6 percent and Brazil is at 8.5 percent. And an emerging market bond fund that holds countries like this would be attractive.” Karl Case:  ‘A lot of reasons  to be optimistic’Last year will probably go down as the year that residential real estate prices hit bottom and began to rise after the collapse that began in 2007. This came as no surprise to Mr. Case, an emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College. Mr. Case’s name is practically synonymous with real estate values, since he helped create the widely cited S.& P. Case-Shiller Index of housing prices (along with the Yale economics professor Robert Shiller). A year ago, he told me it was a “terrific” time to buy a house.He was right, at least for most cities. Last month, Standard & Poor’s reported that its Case-Shiller 20-city composite index showed a 4.5 percent gain. Prices in hard-hit Phoenix have now gained for 13 consecutive months. And even in New York City, which along with Chicago was one of just two markets where average prices dropped in 2012, prices of high-end properties hit records, a trend Mr. Case expects to continue.“Phoenix is amazing,” Mr. Case said last week. “California is strong, and it’s doing what it’s done in every other cycle, which is important, because California makes up one-fourth of the housing value in the United States. But residential real estate is not going to go up like a rocket ship.”That’s because the slump was so severe that expectations for homeownership have been sharply lowered. Talk in Washington of eliminating or curbing the mortgage deduction in the name of tax reform is weighing on prices. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both taxpayer-supported, are still guaranteeing most mortgages, which isn’t sustainable, he said.As a result, “the recovery won’t be anything like we’ve seen in the past,” Mr. Case predicted. “We’re cheering because we got to 800,000 housing starts. That’s still weak. It only looks good because we dug ourselves into such a deep hole.” But real estate tends to move in longer cycles, and Mr. Case is still saying now is a good time to buy. “There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic, but cautiously so,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/business/mutfund/mutual-funds-found-big-2012-gains-despite-political-worry.html,"ECONOMIC growth remained sluggish and politics often intruded on the markets, yet stocks achieved solid returns last year all the same. It wasn’t the first time that investors scaled a wall of worry, but it might be the only instance when the main source of concern, at least in the fourth quarter, was thought to be a cliff.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 13.4 percent for the year, even with a 1 percent decline in the fourth quarter. In those last months, doubts rose about whether Congress and President Obama could reach an agreement on taxes and spending in time to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff — and the recession that was thought to lie below.The drama in Washington was one of several throughout the year that kept investors focused more on capitols than corporate boardrooms. European leaders were continually devising plans to rescue the euro and some of the economies that use it, and China underwent a change of leadership.Although the fourth-quarter loss was worse soon after Election Day and stocks raced ahead at the start of the new year, investors’ concerns may yet prove well founded. The immediate concerns related to taxes were resolved only at the 11th hour — just past midnight, really — and much remains to be sorted out on spending. Investment advisers said that politics, at home and abroad, would continue to guide markets.“The political environment and uncertainty revolving around policy decisions has been a really big factor,” said Jeremy DeGroot, chief investment officer of the fund provider Litman Gregory. “There are significant deficit issues that developed economies are facing, and the markets are hanging on every development.”One bit of uncertainty was eliminated on Jan. 1, when Congress agreed to limit the scope of scheduled tax increases, although the deal still resulted in higher tax rates on payrolls, dividends and capital gains.Worries also abated when European Union finance ministers agreed in the fourth quarter to place big banks under the supervision of the European Central Bank. That followed the bank’s announcement that it would support the bond markets of weaker economies, which are concentrated along the region’s southern periphery.THE moves on both sides of the Atlantic helped stock funds achieve modest fourth-quarter gains. The average domestic fund in Morningstar’s database rose 0.9 percent. International funds fared better, up 4.8 percent, on average, with portfolios that focus on European stocks returning 7.4 percent and emerging-market funds rising 6.2 percent. Full-year returns exceeded 14 percent for all four categories.Yields on short- and long-term debt remained low all year as the Federal Reserve and other central banks maintained the easy monetary policies in force since the 2008 crisis. While that could account for much of stocks’ strength during 2012, the influence on bond returns, at least on high-quality government issues, may be waning.The average bond fund rose a healthy 8.4 percent on the year, but the fourth-quarter gain was a slim 1.3 percent, dragged lower by a 1.1 percent loss for portfolios of long-term government bonds. High-yield bond funds rose 3.1 percent for the quarter, on average, and funds that specialize in debt issued in emerging economies gained 3.9 percent.Just how helpful low interest rates were for economic growth is hard to discern. American economic output has continued to expand at a sluggish pace. And Europe is widely seen to be in recession.“The trend of deterioration in Europe is not slowing down,” said Virginie Maisonneuve, head of global and international equities at Schroder Investment Management. She noted, though, that some indicators suggested that conditions were stabilizing at very low levels along the continent’s troubled southern fringe.Whatever the economic impact of low interest rates, they seem to be helping corporate America. Corporate debt issuance last year exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.Increased indebtedness provides leverage that lifts profit margins, said Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of the fund management company GMO. Margins have reached record levels as a proportion of economic output and are “weirdly high,” in his opinion, “unless we’re in one of those wonderful secular shifts that people talk about but almost never see.” He doesn’t glimpse any such new normal, however, and cites high margins as a reason to be cautious about most stocks.Rising debt of another kind is a pressing concern for many investors. With the national debt above $16 trillion, the second part of the fiscal cliff debate, focusing on spending cuts, is expected to be played out over the next month or so in Washington.This could have higher stakes for the economy and markets and cause more acrimony than the haggling over tax rates. That’s because the debt ceiling — the limit imposed by Congress on the government’s borrowing authority — has been reached again. The concern is that Republicans will withhold approval to raise the ceiling without meaningful spending cuts. A similar battle in 2011 led to a downgrade of Treasury debt and was the catalyst for a violent stock market decline.“We know there’s going to be another fight around the debt ceiling in February,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. “We avoided plummeting off the cliff, but we haven’t avoided more cliffs in the future.”THE immediate outlook for financial markets depends on how the next cliff is navigated. An overhaul of programs like Social Security and Medicare, combined with a revamping of the tax code in a so-called grand bargain, would set spending on a gentler slope for the long term without abrupt cuts now, investment advisers said. But some, like Mr. DeGroot, were not holding their breath.“We have to have a credible medium- to long-term plan to bring down the excess of spending over revenues, but politicians are usually not ones to make those tough decisions until they’re forced to,” he said. “It usually takes a market disruption to force their hand. Kicking the can is an easier, less painful approach. At some point, do investors say they don’t see a resolution to this?”Mr. DeGroot finds little to recommend to investors, though he does see opportunity in foreign stocks, particularly in emerging economies. Better still, he said, are so-called unconstrained bond funds whose managers have great flexibility in how they invest.Mr. Grantham also finds emerging stock markets appealing, along with Japan and “cheap European value stocks,” and he advises longer-term investors to consider commodity and energy stocks. As for the United States, he judges the market overvalued and recommends only high-quality companies.Sometimes, all it takes to do better is to avoid doing worse. Ms. Maisonneuve said investors in Europe, for example, had begun to recognize that if the region “is leaving behind its near-death experience, then equity valuations are very attractive, compared to fixed income.” A recovery in Chinese and American growth could help Europe “continue to heal itself,” she added.As for sectors, she particularly favors global health care, which can profit from drug sales to emerging economies, and cyclical industrial companies and commodity providers that would benefit from resurgent Chinese growth. She also likes financial service companies but is avoiding European banks.Investors fixated last year on so-called tail risks, or potential negative surprises. But what if 2013 offered some head risks? Such positive surprises wouldn’t faze Francis Scotland, director of global macro research at Brandywine Global.“I think people are looking in the wrong direction,” Mr. Scotland said. “There is a risk that something might actually go right. I think we’re in a sweet spot. Let’s assume we take most of the sting out of the fiscal cliff. Just the clarity will improve the corporate sector outlook. There’s a real case for the economy to grow above trend in the first half. It’s time to move to a more risk-oriented strategy.”While he is happy to advocate for the American economy and likes domestic market sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, Mr. Scotland prefers to take risks elsewhere. He recommends bonds in peripheral European countries like Italy and Ireland; investment-grade emerging bond markets like Mexico, Poland and South Africa; and Japanese, Chinese and European stocks.“You could make a case for all of these markets doing well, relative to the U.S.,” he said.MR. LEVKOVICH makes the case for American stocks doing well. He says he expects the S. &P. 500 to rise 13 percent this year, to 1,615. He agrees with Mr. Scotland that “there’s a bunch of good news out there.”“Housing has improved, and job trends should improve based on surveys and credit growth,” Mr. Levkovich said. “There’s an energy boom in places like Montana and South Dakota that is growing more jobs, and manufacturing competitiveness is developing in this country; it’s cheaper to build a plant and produce goods in South Carolina than in Shenzhen.”Even though he is hopeful about 2013, Mr. Levkovich acknowledged that investors might want to wait until Washington produced a deal that averts the next fiscal cliff before they focus on the more pleasant landscape beyond it.“We’ve got this positive dynamic,” he said. “The biggest constraint we’re facing is the fiscal issue and dysfunctional government.”"

So many billions here for supposed mortgage abuses, so many billions there for questionable foreclosures.But there’s more than meets the eye to the big legal settlements you’ve been reading about involving some of the nation’s biggest banks.Actually, there’s less than meets the eye.The dollar signs are big, but they aren’t as big as they look, at least for the banks. That’s because some or all of these payments will probably be tax-deductible. The banks can claim them as business expenses. Taxpayers, therefore, will likely lighten the banks’ loads.There is nothing new about corporations reaping tax benefits from payments made to remedy wrongdoing. Every so often, though, the topic stirs outrage. After the Gulf of Mexico oil spill, for example, BP received a $10 billion tax windfall by writing off $37.2 billion in cleanup expenses.With multibillion-dollar mortgage settlements making headlines this year and last, the question has come to the fore again. Why should taxpayers subsidize corporations that are paying to right sometimes egregious wrongs? That is a particularly weighty question, given the urgent need for tax revenue to offset the ballooning federal budget deficit.Under federal law, money paid to settle a company’s actual or potential liability for a civil or criminal penalty is not deductible. But, this being taxes, the issue is complicated. As Robert W. Wood, a tax lawyer, said in a 2009 Tax Notes article, “The tax deduction for business expenses is broad enough to include most settlements and judgments.”In an interview last week, Mr. Wood, who is also the author of “Taxation of Damage Awards and Settlement Payments,” said the test for deductibility boils down to whether the payment is a penalty or is meant to be remedial. “I don’t know the specifics on these mortgage settlements,” he said, “but if any of the lenders are putting a bunch of money into a pot that goes to help people, yes, I would assume that everybody will deduct that.”Nevertheless, the deductibility test is not always clear. And companies naturally push hard for these tax benefits when they negotiate settlements with the government.Unfortunately, the government rarely specifies what the tax treatment of a settlement should be, leaving enforcement to the Internal Revenue Service. One exception is the Securities and Exchange Commission. Since 2003, it has barred companies from deducting settlement costs as a business expense.Senator Charles Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is a senior member of the Senate Finance Committee, has been critical of favorable tax treatments of settlements. I asked him last week about the issue as it relates to mortgage settlements.“You can be sure the Wall Street banks consider tax consequences in negotiations and the government should, too,” he said.  “Any portion of a settlement that’s intended to be a penalty should include language clarifying it isn’t deductible. Otherwise, the government’s punishment will have less sting than intended.”IT is to be expected that corporations, like any taxpayers, will do what they can to reduce their tax bills. And a 2005 report from the Government Accountability Office suggests that tax benefits in settlements are prevalent. Examining more than $1 billion in settlements made by 34 companies, the G.A.O. found that 20 had deducted some or all of the money from their tax bills.But as Mr. Grassley suggested, the government can take deductibility off the table as an option. And occasionally it does. For example, a Justice Department spokesman said that there would be no deductibility of the $500 million penalty and fine portion of the settlement reached with UBS last month in regards to manipulation of interest rates.Certainly, a settlement’s punitive effect is lessened by any tax sweeteners it generates. Perhaps that’s why it is rarely clear from the public announcements that some or all of the settlement amounts will be deductible.Consider last week’s settlement between the government and large mortgage servicers over foreclosure abuses. Wells Fargo said in its news release that the bank would pay $766 million in cash and contribute $1.2 billion to foreclosure-prevention activities. But are those after-tax or pretax numbers? No mention was made, and a spokeswoman declined to comment other than to say that Wells Fargo “is a compliant taxpayer” that fulfills all its tax obligations.Or consider the recent settlements over soured mortgages reached by Bank of America and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These are almost certainly tax-deductible, Mr. Wood said, because these are probably considered deals between private parties, even though taxpayers own Fannie and Freddie.So the deal announced last week by Bank of America to pay Fannie Mae $10.3 billion for a mortgage-related settlement, as well as the $2.62 billion in cash paid by the bank to Fannie and Freddie Mac in late 2010, probably generated, or will generate, significant tax benefits through deductions for the bank. A Bank of America spokesman declined to comment.Phineas Baxandall, senior analyst for tax and budget policy at the United States Public Interest Research Group, a consumer-oriented nonprofit, and Ryan Pierannunzi, a tax and budget associate there, explored this issue in a report published last week.The report, titled “Subsidizing Bad Behavior,” details the history of the practice and suggests that government agencies should follow the S.E.C.’s lead and disallow deductibility in settlements. Barring that, the authors said, regulators should disclose only the after-tax amounts of settlements, so that people understand how much money is really being paid.In an interview last week, Mr. Baxandall noted that government agencies might not want to do that. “From the agencies’ point of view, unless the public or someone is pressuring them to do otherwise, they want a big number to tout,” he said. “Tax deductibility allows them to come out with a bigger number.”CONGRESS has tried to change this setup. In 2003, Mr. Grassley and two other senators introduced the Government Settlement Transparency Act.It would have required that payments made by companies acknowledging actual or potential violations of a law would not be tax-deductible. The legislation never passed.Bills have also been introduced in Congress that would bar deductibility on punitive damage awards arranged among private parties. Those have died, too. Past administrations have supported this idea, and the Obama administration has a proposal in its 2013 budget stating that no deduction would be allowed in such a circumstance. That proposal also states that when an existing insurance policy covered the payment of punitive damages, the amount paid would be considered income to the insured person.Not a bad idea.As settlements for corporate misdeeds pile up, perhaps it will get some traction."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/jobs/linda-zecher-from-geophysicist-to-publisher.html,"I  GREW up in Middletown in southwestern Ohio. My mother took care of my brother and me. My father had several businesses, including a trucking company. I had a paper delivery route and worked as a candy striper at the local hospital.I also worked in the stables at River Downs Racetrack in Cincinnati, arriving early in the morning to exercise the horses. Three summers in a row, I worked at the Hamilton County jail, assisting the head jailer.I attended Ohio State University, earning a degree in earth science education in 1975. I married in my senior year, and after graduation we moved to Midland, Tex. I was hired by Texas Instruments to work as a geophysicist. Typically, I was the only woman on a crew of geologists and drillers.Not long after my son Jason was born, in 1979, I was transferred to Dallas, where I led a team of geophysicists. Three years later, I was transferred to Denver. The next year, in 1983, my husband took a job in San Francisco, and we moved with him.I found a job with Bank of America, heading the business service product management team and later the payroll services system. I left in 1989 to go to PeopleSoft, a human resources and business management systems software provider. I was its ninth employee. As vice president for sales and marketing, I helped the company go public three years later.But I was spending less time than I wanted with my husband, Richard, and son, so we decided to uproot again. My husband retired and we moved to Charlottesville, Va., where I could pursue my love of riding horses. But when a friend, who was recruiting me to lead a fund-raiser, mentioned that I was the “perfect socialite,” I knew that it was time to get back into the job market.In 1996 I joined the Oracle Corporation in its Reston, Va., offices, where I worked as senior vice president in charge of its customers in the public sector. Six years later, I left to become C.E.O. of the Evolve Corporation, a software provider in San Francisco. This time I commuted back and forth, which was easier because my son was then out of college. The company was sold a year later.In 2005, I joined Microsoft, where I first headed its United States public sector division, then was promoted to direct its $8 billion worldwide public sector business. The job meant leading a team of 2,000 professionals in more than 100 countries, serving customers in the education, government and health care sectors.I was thinking of retiring, but in September 2011 I joined Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, a 180-year-old company that introduced the country to such literary figures as Ralph Waldo Emerson and Henry David Thoreau. Over the years, the company had gone through a series of acquisitions and mergers to bolster its position in the kindergarten-through-Grade 12 educational market. Recently it had undergone some financial strain.I love reading, so I couldn’t pass up the chance to work there. Last year, I helped steer the company through a voluntary bankruptcy, eliminating $3 billion in debt. I have been working to restore the company’s place in Boston’s business and civic community. Executives are now required to live in or around Boston, and we are supporting more local institutions and nonprofits involved in education.I encourage our 3,500 employees around the world to volunteer and support their local organizations. And while I love the bustle of living in Boston, I also make sure to get back to the Maryland shore, where we now have a home, to relax and recharge.Of course, I also like to pick up a good book."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/your-money/investing-abroad-may-require-a-detailed-map-this-year.html,"AT the start of 2012, stock investors braced themselves for what seemed to be shaping up as a difficult year abroad.“Many felt the euro zone would blow apart and that China and the emerging world economies would hard-land,” said James W. Paulsen, chief investment strategist at Wells Capital Management.Yet despite widespread worries over Europe’s debt crisis and China’s rapidly slowing economy, a broad swath of foreign stocks in the developed and emerging markets delivered double-digit gains for the year.As 2013 begins, it looks once again like a tough slog for international investors — and this time, conditions may actually make it harder to generate strong portfolio returns. For starters, investors will have to be far more selective with their foreign stocks if they hope to enjoy the type of success they did last year, money managers say.This is partly because much low-hanging fruit has already been picked. Value-minded funds that bet that blue-chip European stocks were being unfairly punished for the region’s debt troubles earned 6.8 percent in the recently ended quarter and 16.8 percent for all of 2012. And growth-oriented funds that focus on China had impressive gains of 11.6 percent in the fourth quarter and 20.4 percent for the year.To be sure, “the long-term story of the emerging markets — with their faster-growing economies and younger populations — has legs,” said Jason Hsu, chief investment officer at the investment consulting firm Research Affiliates. “And in Europe, stocks are still trading at historic discounts.” For instance, based on 10 years of averaged earnings, the price-to-earnings ratio for European equities was less than 16 as the new year began, versus an average of slightly more than 20 over the last decade, he said.But the risks are clearly on the rise, fund managers say.For instance, while valuations abroad remain generally attractive, the same cannot be said about the pricing of high-quality companies in both the developed and emerging-market worlds that fund managers most covet.Consider emerging-market companies that sell largely to consumers in their home regions, as opposed to customers in the much slower-growing developed world. While the P/E ratio for the Morgan Stanley Capital International Emerging Markets index was only 12 at the start of the year, based on projected earnings, it was more than 25 for consumer-related stocks in that index, according to Bloomberg.“The disparity in valuations in the emerging markets between high-quality consumer companies and the rest is much wider than in the developed world,” said Simon Hallett, chief investment officer at the asset management firm Harding Loevner.“Investing in the emerging markets is a question of price as well as relative growth,” Mr. Hallett added. “My point is that P/E expansion in the companies we want to buy in that region has at least largely taken place.”This explains why the Harding Loevner International Equity fund, which outpaced 70 percent of its peers over the last year, has more than half of its portfolio in Europe and just 13 percent in the developing world.Yet there are risks in betting on European equities, other managers say.For instance, in recent years, a popular strategy among investors with European shares has been to concentrate on multinational companies that generate the bulk of their sales in the faster-growing emerging markets. These companies are generating stronger revenue and earnings growth than European concerns that do most of their business in their recession-racked home region.While this strategy has worked, “valuations are looking stretched among these companies,” said Harry H. Hartford, president of Causeway Capital Management and co-manager of the Causeway International Value fund, which beat 98 percent of its peers in 2012 and 92 percent over the last five years.A good example is Diageo, the spirits maker. After surging more than 36 percent last year, shares of the company — the seller of brands like Johnnie Walker, Smirnoff and Tanqueray — traded at a frothy P/E ratio of 38 as the year began, based on projected 2013 earnings. And after gaining 19 percent in 2012, shares of the household products maker Unilever traded at a forward P/E of nearly 17, versus 15 for Procter & Gamble, its United States-based rival.The choice for investors is difficult. They may need to pay uncomfortably high prices for quality stocks or assume a different type of risk by going down the quality curve to companies with poorer balance sheets and earnings prospects.Mr. Hartford added that investors should be aware of yet another risk, even if it seems unlikely right now. In 2012, global stocks were supported by cheap capital made available by central banks worldwide. Thus far, there’s little indication that those central banks, including the Federal Reserve in the United States, will turn off the spigot of cheap liquidity. But it could happen.“If there is a withdrawal of that liquidity, or if we get higher interest rates in the U.S. or Europe for that matter, you’d have to be much more selective with stocks,” Mr. Hartford said.“I don’t anticipate that happening anytime soon,” he added. Still, he said, “it is undoubtedly the case that the further we get into 2013, in the absence of another round of unanticipated economic weakness, there is a greater likelihood of interest rates rising.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/us/politics/treasury-will-not-mint-1-trillion-coin-to-raise-debt-ceiling.html,"WASHINGTON — The Treasury Department said Saturday that it will not mint a trillion-dollar platinum coin to head off an imminent battle with Congress over raising the government’s borrowing limit.“Neither the Treasury Department nor the Federal Reserve believes that the law can or should be used to facilitate the production of platinum coins for the purpose of avoiding an increase in the debt limit,” Anthony Coley, a Treasury spokesman, said in a written statement.The Obama administration has indicated that the only way for the country to avoid a cash-management crisis as soon as next month is for Congress to raise the “debt ceiling,” which is the statutory limit on government borrowing. The cap is $16.4 trillion.“There are only two options to deal with the debt limit: Congress can pay its bills, or it can fail to act and put the nation into default,” Jay Carney, the White House press secretary, said in a statement. “Congress needs to do its job.”In recent weeks, some Republicans have indicated that they would not agree to raise the debt limit unless Democrats agreed to make cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security.The White House has said it would not negotiate spending cuts in exchange for Congressional authority to borrow more, and it has insisted that Congress raise the ceiling as a matter of course, to cover expenses already authorized by Congress. In broader fiscal negotiations, it has said it would not agree to spending cuts without commensurate tax increases.The idea of minting a trillion-dollar coin drew wide if puzzling attention recently after some bloggers and economic commentators had suggested it as an alternative to involving Congress.By virtue of an obscure law meant to apply to commemorative coins, the Treasury secretary could order the production of a high-denomination platinum coin and deposit it at the Federal Reserve, where it would count as a government asset and give the country more breathing room under its debt ceiling. Once Congress raised the debt ceiling, the Treasury secretary could then order the coin destroyed.Mr. Carney, the press secretary, fielded questions about the theoretical tactic at a news conference last week. But the idea is now formally off the table.The White House has also rejected the idea that it could mount a challenge to the debt ceiling itself, on the strength of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution, which holds that the “validity of the public debt” of the United States “shall not be questioned.”The Washington Post earlier published a report that the Obama administration had rejected the platinum-coin idea."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/business/mutfund/core-plus-funds-add-new-ingredients-to-a-stock-bond-mix.html,"A  PORTFOLIO balanced between stocks and bonds, in a roughly 60-40 split, is a staple diet of investing. These two asset classes often move to different rhythms, so overall returns tend to have milder swings than either one experiences on its own.But this conventional mix may not be as appealing as it used to be, some investment advisers say. Bonds are extremely overvalued with yields at multiyear lows, they say, and while they view stocks as more reasonably priced, they acknowledge that the ups and downs of the last few months are liable to rattle investors’ nerves.What can be done? Some advisers suggest adding fresh ingredients to a portfolio, by buying so-called core-plus funds that hold a broader variety of assets. Others recommend sticking patiently with the traditional recipe. But either way, they warn, investors should prepare for something that may be less palatable than they are accustomed to.“This is not a great time to be investing in anything right now due to volatility in the markets and the enormous amount of macroeconomic uncertainty,” said Harold Ratner, a senior investment strategist at Morningstar. “Across the board, nothing is screamingly attractive.”But if investors have the luxury of staying fully invested, Mr. Ratner doesn’t consider the two main asset classes ugly enough to suggest abandoning conventional balanced funds. If investors are saving for retirement or another long-term goal, then owning the funds “is probably an O.K. thing to do,” he said, adding that “the world has not changed that much in the last five or six years that you would need to change your strategy.”Someone who is more adventurous, or more sensitive to changing market conditions, might look at core-plus funds, he said. Although these vehicles keep a large majority of their assets in stocks and bonds, they also invest in alternatives like commodities, real estate investment trusts or hedge fund strategies. Depending on how they invest, Morningstar will classify them as “conservative allocation,” “moderate allocation,” “aggressive allocation” or “world allocation” funds, all niches in the balanced-fund category.Rob Arnott, chairman and chief executive of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, is among those who say it’s time to branch out from conventional funds. He tells investors that they “urgently need to build a third pillar.”In Mr. Arnott’s opinion, an investment in alternatives is wise in the interest of diversification and risk reduction, but if inflation flares up down the road, as he expects, it would worsen the outlook for stocks and bonds enough to warrant particularly large allocations elsewhere.“Stocks and bonds are going to be a big mistake for years,” he said. “Do yourself the favor of building a modest third pillar that can protect you” against inflation.Bonds perform poorly in an inflationary environment, something that Mr. Arnott expects as a result of very loose monetary policy, he explained, and valuations on stocks fall because inflation generally sends interest rates higher.The drawback to expanding beyond the two main classes now is that alternative assets have joined them in the mainstream, said Christopher Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic Capital, a financial planning firm in Morristown, N.J. Many investors have been buying such alternatives to the point that they may have become overvalued.“With bond yields at all-time lows, investors are looking elsewhere for yield,” Mr. Cordaro said. “They’re pouring money into REITs, commodities and hedge funds. This is not the time to get too fancy. I think investors are taking on a huge amount of risk and not realizing it.”One evergreen risk of owning any balanced fund stems from the difficulty of knowing what it contains. One portfolio that holds only stocks and bonds might be limited to blue chips and investment-grade bond issues, said Mr. Ratner, the Morningstar strategist, while another might reach into emerging markets, small-company stocks and high-yield corporate debt. When a portfolio starts adding alternative assets, the complexity only climbs from there.The mix might include some holdings that investors would prefer to avoid, advisers say, but because managers report holdings only intermittently, shareholders don’t always know what’s coming or going from their funds.Then there is the matter of management quality. An investor who buys a balanced fund, other than one that passively tracks stock and bond indexes, is placing faith in a manager’s ability to be a jack-of-all-trades — or at least a jack-of-two-trades.“I’m generally not a big fan of balanced funds because I like to control the mix,” said Kent Kramer, a partner of the Foster Group, a financial planning firm in West Des Moines, Iowa.He would rather own separate portfolios to gain exposure to various kinds of stocks and bonds.“The vast majority of investors are going to have a better experience and probably with a lot less cost” with a more limited mix of assets, he said. “ ‘Souped up’ sometimes really means more expensive, and I don’t know if you’re getting bang for the buck.”He advises investors who are interested in balanced funds to start the search with Vanguard, a fund provider known for low expenses. “With Vanguard, you get a good explanation of the fees, and the fees are low,” he said.The Vanguard Balanced Index fund seeks to replicate the MSCI U.S. Broad Market Index of stocks and the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index of bonds in the traditional 60-40 ratio. It has annual expenses of 0.24 percent and gets four stars from Morningstar and a gold rating in the firm’s more subjective analyst rating system.Core-plus funds favored by Morningstar analysts include T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation and Leuthold Core Investment. The Price fund, which gets five stars and a gold rating, the highest on both scales, holds domestic and foreign stocks and conventional bonds, along with convertible bonds, preferred stocks and leveraged loans. The Leuthold fund, with four stars and a silver rating, likewise owns domestic and foreign stocks and bonds, as well as REITs and gold.MR. RATNER encourages investors in balanced funds to consider buying not just one, but rather a handful of them, and to make sure that each holds assets in different proportions, even if the assets are just stocks and bonds. If they seek funds whose managers prefer more assets or more trading among them, he added, they should remember that more doesn’t necessarily mean better.“Investors need to make sure that they’re comfortable with these additional risks,” he said, “and that the managers can add value.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/business/how-boehner-could-find-blue-sky-above-the-debt-ceiling.html,"ALTHOUGH he has been re-elected as House speaker, John Boehner is in danger of becoming irrelevant to the crucial economics discussions that must occur over the next few months.A valuable principle of negotiation is to “never bargain with someone who does not have the power to say yes,” and Mr. Boehner has demonstrated that he lacks that power. He couldn’t even persuade his caucus to agree on a Plan B counterproposal and had to let Vice President Joseph Biden and Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader, steer the deal that avoided, or at least postponed, the so-called fiscal cliff.I have a suggestion for how Mr. Boehner could have himself invited back to the negotiation party. But first, let’s take stock of where we are.What has been accomplished, for better or worse, is that the Bush-era tax cuts for families earning less than $450,000 a year have been made permanent — or at least as permanent as anything in the tax code can be. Those earning more than $450,000 face a tax increase. There are further complications, of course, but the important thing is that there was no substantive tax reform, and no decisions about spending. The final bill even preserved the tradition of corporate welfare by extending a subsidy to Nascar.Over the next few months, Congress faces a new series of deadlines:The spending cuts mandated by the sequestration will begin on March 1, unless Congress delays them again. Congress needs to pass a “continuing resolution” or government will shut down, as it did in the 1990s during the standoff between Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich. And, finally, the debt ceiling will need to be raised or the government will no longer be able to pay its bills to Social Security beneficiaries, the military or the owners of government bonds — a group that includes nearly everyone with a retirement account.I have listed these deadlines in increasing order of their hazard to our economic health. The spending cuts would be tough and arbitrary but gradual. Incurring them for a couple of months would be bad, but not horrible. Closing down the government is more serious. And even if you’d like a smaller government, you probably still want essential services to continue.OF the three, the debt ceiling is likely to arrive first and is simultaneously the most serious and the most ridiculous. It’s serious because it’s unthinkable that the government would stop paying its bills, and the ramifications if we defaulted on our debt payments would be catastrophic for the nation and the global economy. We don’t even want to think about going there.But the debt ceiling is also ridiculous, because the law is redundant. It’s a tradition for members of Congress who aren’t in the same political party as the president to make sanctimonious speeches against raising the debt limit, to keep that president from running up big bills. Yet it is Congress, in fact, that determines how much we spend and how much tax revenue we collect. Our representatives and their predecessors passed the bills and authorized the spending that got us to this place. If they want to reduce the deficit, they should cut spending, increase revenue, or both. But what they should not do, under any circumstances, is to look back at the decisions they have already made and conclude that it would be smart to declare the United States bankrupt, thus creating a second global financial crisis.Which leads to my proposal for restoring Mr. Boehner’s relevance: He should propose that the debt ceiling be raised for at least two years or, even better, propose that it be abolished. He wouldn’t need a majority of his own party to vote for such a bill, of course, because it would have wide support among Democrats. He would just have to propose it and persuade some of his colleagues to support it. That would be enough.Here is why I think this is a good idea, for him, the Republican Party and the country:Congress has plenty of incentives to make a deal on spending. Taxes have already been increased and Republicans are eager to even the score. The sequestration-induced spending cuts coming on March 1 should provide more than enough impetus for Congress and the president to agree to something, even if it’s only a plan to undertake serious tax reform and a comprehensive evaluation of all government spending. By removing an option that we should never rationally use, we can immediately accomplish an often-cited Republican goal — reducing global uncertainty — and likely restore our triple-A credit rating. The Bipartisan Policy Center has estimated that the dillydallying about the debt ceiling last time, which ticked up interest rates, will end up costing more than $18.9 billion over 10 years, about the same amount as the recent Medicare “doc fix, ” which blocks cuts to doctor reimbursement rates.Tea Party conservatives would undoubtedly be outraged by this suggestion, arguing that Republicans need to retain the debt ceiling threat if they are to get the best possible deal from the Senate and the president. But taking this crazy threat away from a group that just might use it is precisely the point.By undertaking this act of unilateral disarmament, Mr. Boehner and whichever Republicans had the courage to join him would be signaling that they’re willing to engage in the serious discussions the country needs, and to put pressure on Democrats to do likewise. Anyone who has a large bomb and is threatening to push the button doesn’t deserve to be a party to these discussions."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/business/mutfund/junk-bonds-could-lose-some-sparkle-this-year.html,"WHEN the financial crisis erupted several years ago, its victims included lenders to the weakest and most debt-laden companies. Investors in junk-bond mutual funds suffered a negative return of roughly 25 percent in 2008.But since then, Federal Reserve policies have flattened interest rates, punishing savers with yields that don’t even keep up with inflation. With little incentive to park money in bank certificates of deposit, yield-starved investors have sought out riskier instruments.This quest for yield has been a boon to the below-investment-grade debt known as junk or high-yield bonds. Issuance of such bonds — those ranked BB or lower — set a record last year, according to Standard & Poor’s. “Even the lowest-rated issuer has access to capital markets,” said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at S.& P.As the capital-raising prospects brightened for such companies, so did the fortunes of their bondholders. Junk bonds have produced an average annual total return of nearly 19 percent over the last four years, Ms. Vazza reported. In 2012, high-yield mutual funds trailed only emerging-market funds among all fixed-income sectors, producing total returns of more than 14 percent, according to Morningstar.“The Fed is winning,” said Elaine Stokes, co-manager of the Loomis Sayles High Income fund. “You’re not making anything by leaving money in the bank. High-yield has been a clear net winner.”Of course, the past is only sometimes prologue in the fickle financial markets. Many high-yield portfolio managers caution against expectations of repeat double-digit returns this year.“It’s hard to get really excited by U.S. high-yield or high-yield globally, given the huge run-up it’s had,” Ms. Stokes said.Andrew Feltus, lead manager of the Pioneer Global High Yield fund, and Darren Hughes, co-manager of the Invesco High Yield fund, foresee returns of 6 to 7 percent this year for junk bonds in general.Of course, that’s awfully good when the alternative is a bank certificate of deposit that may yield a sliver of 1 percent. Even 10-year Treasuries return less than 2 percent.Is the world so topsy-turvy that risky investments are a sure bet to at least triple the safest investments?Maybe.But junk-bond buyers should remember that they face some serious risks. One is the risk of default. For speculative issues, the default rate is currently low, just 2.7 percent. Even if it ticks higher, as S.& P. expects, to 3.7 percent in 2013, that’s still below the 30-year historical norm of 4.5 percent. So defaults probably shouldn’t cost investors “much more than one percentage point in total return” this year, said James Keenan, lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock High Yield Bond Portfolio.The bigger risk may be a decline in bond prices. Rising interest rates are typically the lurking natural enemy of bond prices. But with the Fed adamantly holding rates down, that seems an unlikely ambush for now.More worrisome is the prospect of an economic downturn. “The risks of the high-yield market declining in price are tied to the risks of recession,” Mr. Keenan said.But even without a recession, the prices of junk-bond investments could tumble if investors decided for any number of reasons to move their money out of the category.One such catalyst would be a sharp pickup in the economic recovery. A more robust recovery would produce an “acceleration of earnings growth” that would drive investors out of bonds and into stocks, Mr. Hughes of Invesco said.That’s why market watchers pay close attention to fund flows: the streams of money coming in and out of investment sectors. For most of 2012, junk bonds have been fund-flow magnets. But there have been recent signs of reversal. High-yield mutual funds had outflows of cash in September, November and December, and high-yield exchange-traded funds had outflows in October and November.“The greatest risk is rotation out of high-yield into equities as a result of an improving economy and improving earnings,” Ms. Stokes said.Fund managers, meanwhile, wonder whether the sectors that performed so well last year will lead again in 2013.Housing and building materials, among the strongest sectors last year, were big winners for the Invesco fund. “We’ve been pretty bullish on the housing recovery and it’s worked well,” Mr. Hughes said. The fund holds credits of the homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises, as well as Nortek, which makes residential heating, cooling and ventilation products.At Pioneer Global High Yield, Mr. Feltus notes that European credits were very strong performers last year. But in 2013, he sees potential for currency gains to bolster returns in several emerging markets. “Mexico’s might be the best-performing currency next year,” Mr. Feltus said. He also sees potential gains in the currencies of Malaysia and the Philippines.Mr. Feltus emphasizes the importance of credit analysis in sifting through high-yield debt issues. “You’ve got to do your homework,” he said.Fund managers, of course, are always aware of the credit ratings issued by an agency like S.& P. or Moody’s, But Mr. Hughes also says it’s important to dig further. “The agencies may be wrong,” he said. ““We do our own credit analysis.”FOR investors torn between a hunger for return and a need for safety, high-yield will always pose a conundrum. “This is a very risky asset class,” said Sarah Bush, an analyst at Morningstar. “There’s a lot of credit risk. This is not a place you should think of as a safe place for your money.”On the other hand, as Ms. Stokes says, investors are making little money by leaving it in the bank.Similarly, Mr. Keenan said, “I think 6 to 7 percent returns are going to look pretty good at the end of 2013.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/sunday-review/the-low-politics-of-economic-growth.html,"WE typically blame Washington for not doing more to help the economy grow. But what if we have it backward: What if it is the weak economy that is driving the failures in Washington?That is what Benjamin Friedman, a Harvard economist who has studied the way slow growth frays societies and strains politics, thinks. “We could be stuck in a trap,” he told me last week. “We could be stuck in a perverse equilibrium in which our absence of growth is delivering political paralysis, and the political paralysis preserves the absence of growth.”Consider how different our politics might be today if the economy had not collapsed in 2008 and not been mired in sluggish growth ever since. A ballpark estimate suggests that if the economy were to grow one percentage point more than expected in each year over the next 10, the deficit would shrink by more than $3 trillion. That would be more than enough to set the ratio of our debt to our annual economic output on a comforting downward trajectory. Moreover, it would happen without making cuts to a single program, like Medicare or food stamps, or without raising a single dollar of additional tax revenue. Even a much smaller boost to growth — say one-tenth of a percentage point per year, or even half that — would make Congress and the White House’s burden hundreds of billions of dollars lighter.And consider how much better deficit reduction might feel to families in a growing economy, compared with a limping one. The recovery in the past year has delivered only sluggish wage growth, with much erased by inflation as more of a worker’s paycheck goes to paying for more expensive groceries, tuition bills and gas. The end of a payroll tax holiday was only one small portion of the fiscal deal the White House and Republican leaders brokered at the turn of the year. Yet it was enough to wipe out a full year’s worth of wage gains entirely.Indeed, even before the economic crisis, middle-class incomes had stagnated, with the economy’s gains primarily going to a thin sliver of wealthy families. Then, of course, the crisis hit, forcing millions into unemployment and millions more into poverty. Given that reality, Democrats have fought for making the George W. Bush-era tax cuts permanent for 98 percent of households. Republicans have argued that nobody should have to shoulder the burden of tax increases at all.“Everything is easier to do if the economy is growing,” says William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution. “If you want to cut spending, it is easier to do in an environment where people think they are going to have robust income growth and aren’t as dependent on government. In terms of taxes, growth gets you not just more income to tax, but taxpayers moving into higher rates.”Yet growth has broadly disappeared from the fiscal discussion that continues to occupy Congress and the White House, a discussion that has focused obsessively on deficits and debts, spending and taxes and fairness. But growth will be one of the most crucial determinants of whether the country can find its way back to fiscal health in the long run.Indeed, the United States is currently facing a burden of debt so large that, hypothetically, it would take more than half of the country’s economic output over a whole year to pay it off. It is also recovering from a recession so deep and a recovery so sluggish that there has been no net job growth since 2005.That makes deficit reduction vastly harder, as it means asking voters who are already struggling to sacrifice more now in order to avert the abstract threat of a future debt crisis. “I do think that part of what we’re seeing — the nasty tone of our politics, the anti-immigrant sentiment — has a lot to do with the fact that the average American family has now seen no increase in its real income for 15 years,” said Mr. Friedman, the Harvard economist.The problem is that it is not easy to increase growth, and it is particularly difficult if you are also trying to reduce deficits. The deal just struck by Congress to remove the worst of the blow from the so-called fiscal cliff will nevertheless give the economy a cold chill of austerity this year, with forecasters estimating that the expiration of that payroll tax holiday, new tax hikes and previously legislated spending cuts might cut 2013 economic growth from 3 percent to 2 percent or even lower.AT the same time that the fiscal cliff deal did little for growth, it did little to reduce deficits either. Indeed, the deal, as a whole, increased the debt by almost $4 trillion over 10 years as compared with simply going over the cliff.That comes with its own growth implications. “We’ve put ourselves in the box that we have an economy so heavily laden with debt that anyone thinking about growing-expanding-hiring here is facing a fundamental roll of the dice,” said Doug Holtz-Eakin, a former director of the Congressional Budget Office and a top Republican economist. At some point, Mr. Eakin says, the country would need to increase taxes, slash social spending or face significantly higher borrowing costs — none of which would help businesses or individuals. “We’re giving people a terrible deal over any sensible horizon,” he told me.That is why the original White House proposal and many bipartisan deficit proposals — like those put forward by the Simpson-Bowles commission or Alice Rivlin of Brookings and former Senator Pete Domenici — included a jolt of stimulus to help ensure growth as the country continues to recover from the recession.The idea is that we do not have to choose between aiding growth now and cutting deficits later. We can simply put in place an integrated policy that does both. This is particularly true given that borrowing costs for the federal government rest at record lows, making growth-boosting investments now and deficit reduction later a particularly good deal by historical standards.It has frustrated many economists that Congress has thus far been unable to agree on such a package. But this is where the chicken-and-egg problem of bad policy in a bad economy comes into play: It is perhaps the case that a side effect of bad economies is bad policy, which then makes the economy worse, which makes politics worse, and so on.A potential example of how that might manifest in an extreme fashion is the debt ceiling. The unusually bad economic and budgetary conditions the country has faced in recent years have led Republicans to make the unprecedented decision to threaten national default unless the White House accedes to their preferred economic policies — namely finally making significant cuts to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.If the two sides are unable to come to an agreement by the deadline, the United States government could fail to pay its obligations for the first time in history, triggering global financial chaos and doing terrific damage to the United States economy. Thus would a bad economy have led to bad political decisions that ended in a much worse economy.At this point, even the optimists do not sound that optimistic. Their argument is not that fast growth will return quickly, but that it will, eventually, return. “I don’t think the long-term growth picture has changed at all,” says Mark Zandi of Moody’s Analytics. “What we have been going through is wrenching, and it’s hard to say it is temporary because it has been going on for a while. It’s a deep hole, and it’s taking a long time to get out. But we’ll get on the other side of this.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/jobs/new-years-resolutions-at-work-and-how-to-keep-them.html,"Q. It’s two weeks into the new year, and you can already see your work-related resolutions start to fall by the wayside. This happens every year, so why do you keep setting these kinds of goals? A. We live in a very goal-oriented culture. And we are accustomed to setting goals for the new year in the belief that they help us move forward in big and small ways, says E.J. Masicampo, an assistant psychology professor at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C., who studies goals and goal planning. “Goals can be extremely effective, depending on how people set and approach them,” he says. “They can inspire you and help you keep the bigger picture in mind.”Q. Then why do so many goals or resolutions go unfulfilled?A. One reason that New Year’s resolutions often fail — especially big, sweeping ones — is that people ultimately decide they aren’t worth the trouble, says Eric Schumacher, an associate psychology professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology in Atlanta who studies goal-oriented behavior. “The reward is so far in the future that we don’t stay motivated to keep moving toward it,” he says. “When you set smaller, specific goals, your brain can activate behaviors it knows will help you achieve them.”If, for example, you have a vague goal of moving into management this year, your brain will probably have trouble pinpointing the behaviors you need to get there. But if you instead set a smaller goal beneath the larger one, such as networking with two additional people each week, you now have a specific behavior associated with achieving that bigger goal, Mr. Schumacher says.Another reason we fail to achieve goals is a lack of emotional investment in them, says Anne Dranitsaris, a corporate psychotherapist and owner of Striving Styles, a consulting firm in Toronto. She says we set resolutions believing that our thoughts drive our behavior, even though we are often “motivated to action by our emotions.” So it’s important to know what motivates you — for example, the need for recognition or power and control— and set goals with that in mind, she says. For example, if you know you’re motivated by recognition from colleagues, setting a goal to be a good team player will be hard to achieve, says Ms. Dranitsaris. That’s because “being a team player means being more collaborative; you need to distinguish yourself from others, not be more like them,” she says. An example of a better goal is to be your department’s top sales performer. “You would stand out not only to your peers but to your leader, which will be satisfying for you,” she says.Fear and anxiety, however, can undermine your efforts. If your goal is to find a new job, and if you are a very social person with many friends at the office, you may be anxious about leaving that behind. As a result, you procrastinate and decide you need someone to help you redo your résumé, when you are perfectly capable of doing it yourself. “Next thing you know it’s April and you haven’t found the right person to do it,” says Ms. Dranitsaris, co-author of “Who Are You Meant to Be?”Maybe a goal is simply not worth keeping. Becoming too narrowly focused on certain objectives can make you so single-minded that you don’t see other opportunities to learn, innovate or improve, says Peter Bregman, C.E.O. of Bregman Partners, a leadership consulting firm in New York.Q. Some goals are short term and some are long term. How do you set goals that are, most of all, achievable?A. Set an overall goal and then smaller milestone goals at short intervals, says Sheronde Glover, the chief executive of the Business Practitioner, a business consulting and training firm in Atlanta. “With goal-setting, what’s missing is usually the action steps,” she says. “People think about what they want, but they don’t think through what will actually need to happen to get there.”Say you have the goal of a specific promotion at work. “Clarify what it would take to get into that position,” she says. “Maybe you don’t have all the leadership and public speaking skills you will need, so your first goal becomes enhancing those. That may involve joining a Toastmasters group, taking a management course or working with a particular coach. Establish what needs to happen in three months, six months and nine months.”Ms. Glover says you should also consider the time, effort and money that may be involved: “If you work all day and have a family, where do you fit Toastmasters in? Think through the sacrifices and compromises you will have to make.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/arts/television/real-violence-puts-pressure-on-tv-fiction.html,"LOS ANGELES — When Kevin Reilly, the chairman for entertainment at the Fox network, commissioned an ambitious thriller series called “The Following,” about a Hannibal Lecter-like serial killer who inspires a legion of deranged followers, his intention was to challenge the cable business, not the culture.Now, in the wake of the horrific shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Reilly knows he cannot avoid questions about the propriety of putting that kind of content on television in an atmosphere of heightened sensitivity about violence.“The timing is not great,” Mr. Reilly said in an interview here during the semiannual press tour where networks discuss new programs. “The show does not deserve to be the poster child for our society.”But if the persistent questioning of Mr. Reilly and other executives by reporters who cover the television business is any indication, the issue of extreme violence on screen and its potential impact has become a thicket programmers cannot avoid.“I don’t think there’s anyone on this planet whose life hasn’t been changed and/or affected by the recent course of events,” said Nina Tassler, the president of CBS Entertainment. But, she argued, “nothing that is on the air is inappropriate.”CBS has more programming involving murders than any other network, but, Ms. Tassler said, the network justifies the level of carnage by assuring that “the bad guys are brought to justice.” In response to criticism of a specific CBS show, “Criminal Minds,” which features a serial killer every week, she said she would not allow her 14-year-old child to watch that show because “it’s an adult show.”Bob Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment (which has a show about a young Hannibal Lecter coming up), said, “There are a lot of parameters in broadcast television that we think about, not only as a company that has responsibilities to the F.C.C., but as people who have families.”Debates about television violence have waxed and waned for more than 50 years, sometimes surrounding shows, like “The Rifleman” and “Kojak,” that now seem tame. The increasing appeal of cable series, however, has changed the stakes. In 2001 Bob Wright, chairman of NBC at the time, wrote a memo pointing out an especially violent episode of “The Sopranos” on HBO and questioning whether “there was a lesson” for network shows in the popularity and acceptance of that level of violence.Cable series have become more violent and more popular in the years since. The six highest-rated dramas on cable in the past year were “The Walking Dead,” “Hatfields & McCoys,” “True Blood,” “Sons of Anarchy,” “American Horror Story,” and “Game of Thrones.” All contain high levels of violence.In an interview Mr. Reilly cited those shows and others, saying: “You look at the top scripted shows on cable, and they are all pretty heavy duty. These are not some small cultural little things that people like. The top drama on television now is a show where people get their heads blown off at point-blank range.”The show Mr. Reilly referred to, AMC’s “The Walking Dead,” is not the most-watched drama on television, but it does rank first among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 — the audience that executives want to reach most because advertisers pay the most for them. (Over all the most popular drama is CBS’s “NCIS,” which, like virtually every CBS drama, features at least one murder every week.)On “The Walking Dead” a group of survivors from a dystopian upheaval are compelled to kill hosts of zombies in every episode. Sometimes those zombies are children.Mr. Reilly said the challenge for a network programmer is to compete with that kind of show on cable, which has never been held to the same strictures over content, while trying to maintain sensitivity to cultural standards, something still expected more of companies with broadcast licenses. The outcry over the shootings in Connecticut and elsewhere is clearly complicating that effort.“Had the incident in Connecticut not occurred, I think everybody would be saying ‘The Following’ is a great show, and you’re taking on cable at their own game,” Mr. Reilly said. He noted that AMC’s “Breaking Bad” is now among the most praised shows on television, but it is unquestionably dark and violent.“If you are going to be in this genre,” he said, “the bar is set at the level of shows like ‘Breaking Bad.’ You can’t come in lower and succeed.”The violence in “The Following” is occasionally graphic and disturbing: A woman stabs herself in the eye; a man goes through a street setting strangers on fire. Kevin Williamson, the show’s creator, said in one of the press sessions that he was disturbed by the Newtown incident and the earlier mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.“We sit in the writers’ room after that happened, and we just, sort of, we’re all traumatized by it,” Mr. Williamson said. “It reaches a moment where that just gets too real, and it’s very disturbing.” But he added: “I’m writing fiction. I’m just a storyteller.”John Landgraf, the president of FX, which programs hit dramas based on some level of violence like “America Horror Story” and “Justified,” stressed a distinction between what he called “third-person entertainment” and “first-person entertainment.” The former describes the passive viewing of scripted dramas; the latter describes participatory entertainment, like video games, where shooting and mayhem are personally inflicted on characters.He explicitly tied the prevalence of violence in the United States to the availability of guns, noting that television viewers in Britain watch the same shows as Americans and play the same video games, but that the country has drastically lower murder rates.“We should be looking at ourselves, but I think we have to look at what is most substantially responsible for this kind of violence,” Mr. Landgraf said. “One way to look at that is by looking at the rate at which it takes place in our country and other countries that don’t have access to those kinds of 100-round, 30-round assault-weapon guns.”He did not apologize, however, for the emphasis on life-or-death drama in FX’s shows.“We’re mammals,” he said. “Our greatest fear is death, and if you want to rivet people, you’re going to tend to hover around questions of life and death because that’s the thing that rivets our attention most naturally.”The Fox network has no intention of backing away from “The Following,” which stands as its most important show of a dismal season. Mr. Reilly plans to build his prime-time schedule partly around the show, perhaps using it exactly as AMC has been using “The Walking Dead,” in a pair of eight-episode bursts twice a season.“Most viewers compartmentalize,” Mr. Reilly said. “It’s apples and oranges in their lives. It’s entertainment vs. real life, fact and fiction. If you’re not crazy, you have a very easy time to separate the two, if you’re not a delusional human being — which is, thankfully, the vast majority of people in the world.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/opinion/japans-latest-economic-transfusion.html,"The $116 billion stimulus package unveiled Friday by Japan’s new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, is a step in the right direction for the world’s third-largest economy and America’s fourth-largest trading partner. Mr. Abe’s predecessors in the center-left Democratic Party unwisely followed a course of fiscal austerity, and paid the price for it last month at the polls.Mr. Abe’s package of public-works spending (much of it to rebuild the earthquake-shattered Fukushima region), investment tax credits and more spending on education and health care could help jump start the moribund Japanese economy. Stimulus alone, however, will not be enough for long-term revival. Structural reforms will be needed — though it won’t be easy for Mr. Abe’s conservative Liberal Democratic Party to challenge established interests like rural voters and government-dependent banks. But Japan has no other choice after two decades of anemic growth, sapping the buying power of consumers and the competitiveness of its leading companies.Japan’s population is aging and shrinking. Debt-laden “zombie” companies are kept alive by infusions of government credit. Too many workers are stuck in obsolete manufacturing industries and too few are available for potential growth areas like energy and health technologies. And with public debt equal to 220 percent of national output, Japan is already the world’s most indebted major economy. The new stimulus package will provide no more than a short-term economic boost at the cost of still more government debt. Mr. Abe may well hope that a temporary boost from these measures will create enough new jobs fast enough to give his coalition the majority in the Parliament’s upper house in elections this July. But if he wants to achieve sustainable growth as well, he needs to follow up with a package of structural reforms.These should include provisions for letting zombie companies go bankrupt, phasing out costly agricultural subsidies and raising Japan’s low rates of legal immigration to expand the working-age population. Some forward-looking steps, like expanded health care spending, are already in the stimulus package. But not enough. In 2009, reform-minded voters hoped that the center-left Democrats would carry out overdue changes. But squabbling and incompetence in that party brought only more political disappointment and economic decline. The renewed popularity of Mr. Abe’s party could be equally short-lived unless it follows the stimulus package with lasting reforms."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/technology/start-up-investors-grow-wary-of-tech-ventures-after-facebooks-ipo.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Call it the Facebook effect. Until recently, investors had been all too eager to pour millions into any Web start-up with rapid growth, regardless of whether it made money or even had plans to do so down the road. But after Facebook’s rocky initial public offering and flameouts at Zynga and Groupon, venture capitalists are entering a picky phase.“Earlier, entrepreneurs didn’t need a real monetization strategy,” said Brian O’Malley, an early investor at Battery Ventures. “They could punt on revenue indefinitely because their investment dollars were their revenue. They could fund their start-ups with funding versus customers.”No longer favored are e-commerce start-ups, which face logistical hurdles and require a lot of money. The celebrated shift to smartphones, once welcomed with an outpouring of investments, is now making some investors nervous as monetization proves harder for mobile devices than it did for the Web.Investors have also grown weary of start-ups and applications that rely entirely on Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn for customers, now that those companies are focused on their own bottom lines. And Silicon Valley is discovering that while it may be easier than ever to start a company, it is harder than ever to build an enduring business.Younger start-ups are beginning to feel the pinch. CB Insights, a research firm, analyzed 4,056 initial, or seed, investments made in tech start-ups in the United States since 2009. It found that more than 1,000 start-ups that attracted seed financing from angel investors — wealthy investors who put in money from their own pockets — will find themselves orphaned this year when venture capitalists reject their requests for more money. As a result, $1 billion in angel investments will evaporate.That carnage hardly compares to the bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000, when $3 trillion was lost on the Nasdaq, but it is enough to give Internet investors and entrepreneurs pause.CB Insights predicts that Internet start-ups will be the hardest hit, because they have attracted more seed money than enterprise and hardware companies but will most likely have a harder time securing follow-up investments.Part of the problem is simple math. Angel investors seed businesses with small sums, often less than $1.5 million. But to grow a business, entrepreneurs eventually have to solicit financing from the venture capitalists who invest on behalf of endowments, pension funds, foundations and the like. And while the number of angels eager to write checks has increased, the number of active venture capitalists has decreased.But investors say it is not just the bottleneck that is to blame. The realities of building an enduring business are starting to sink in. “It has never been easier to start a company, and never harder to build one,” said David Lee, a venture capitalist at SV Angel, an early-stage investment firm.David O. Sacks, a Silicon Valley executive who sold Yammer to Microsoft for $1.2 billion last year, summed up the challenges in a bearish note on Facebook last August.“I think Silicon Valley as we know it may be coming to an end,” Mr. Sacks wrote. “To create a successful new company,” he said, entrepreneurs have to find an idea that “has escaped the attention of the major Internet companies, which are better run than before.” To attract follow-up money, new companies now have to prove themselves for less than $5 million.On top of that, they must be “protectable from the onslaught of those big companies once they figure out what you’re on to,” Mr. Sacks said. “How many ideas like that are left?”Mr. Sacks’s comments were widely debated within Silicon Valley. One of his most vocal critics was Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of Netscape and of Andreessen-Horowitz, a venture capital firm, who said on Facebook that the opportunities for start-ups were “unending.”But start-ups are finding that their supply of capital is not. “The valuations got ahead of themselves,” said Rich Wong, a venture investor at Accel Partners. “Where people only paid attention to multiple quarters, now they are looking more than a year ahead for projected results.”Mr. Wong said e-commerce companies in particular were drawing closer scrutiny. Investors who took note of Amazon’s $1.2 billion acquisition of Zappos and its $540 million purchase of Quidsi, the owner of Diapers.com, poured millions into e-commerce sites, only to discover that they are difficult to run.Gilt Groupe, a flash deal site for fashion, raised some $220 million in capital but is still not profitable. Last year, the company was forced to cut staff. It is scaling back on smaller brands like Gilt Taste and Park & Bond, and it has put Jetsetter, its popular online travel site, up for sale. Fab.com, a daily deal site for design, raised money at a lower valuation than it had planned because of Facebook’s troubled I.P.O. Investors also predict that Zulily, a flash deal site for mothers, will have a hard time justifying its recent $1 billion valuation.ShoeDazzle, Kim Kardashian’s shoe site, raised $66 million and Lot18, a flash deal site for wine, raised $45 million from investors impressed with their user growth. Both companies were forced to make staff cuts last year.“I am skeptical of ‘Commerce 2.0,’ which has come to mean daily deals and discounts,” said Peter Fenton, a venture partner at Benchmark Capital. Mr. Fenton said flash sites like Zulily and Gilt “are capital-intensive, face structural challenges to their margins, and if they do go public, they trade at low multiples. Plus, I seriously question their ability to compete with a juggernaut like Amazon.”Likewise, investors are becoming skeptical of social games and applications that build on social networks like Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn. These social networks are a shaky foundation for a business because they themselves are feeling pressure to monetize.For example, Facebook made tweaks to its newsfeed algorithm last fall that reduced the number of users who can view Facebook status updates. The company said it made the tweaks to serve its users more relevant content, but advertisers complained that the changes cut the audience for their posts in half.The real impetus for the change, advertisers say, was to force companies to use Facebook’s new promotion feature, which gives users the option to pay to ensure their updates reach a wider audience.BranchOut, a professional network that culled data from LinkedIn and Facebook, raised $49 million from venture investors but had to change its business model in 2011 after LinkedIn cut off access to its data. More recently, Tweetro, a Twitter application for Windows 8, was removed from the market in November after it outgrew Twitter’s new third-party user limits.“Investors are getting smarter about the sources of traffic,” said Mr. O’Malley of Battery Ventures. “Companies that rely heavily on Twitter and Facebook, or mobile, are having a tougher time.”Venture capital investments in mobile companies were up 75 percent in the first nine months of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011, according to CB Insights, but developers face different challenges on smartphones than they did on the Web.“There was so much hype around the transition to mobile, but people are realizing that mobile is challenging,” Mr. O’Malley said. Among the obstacles is the fact that developers are subject to Apple’s whims. Also, they must persuade people to download their apps, and advertising is more complicated on a smaller screen.So which consumer start-ups are likely to survive the chopping block?“People are looking more seriously at engagement metrics,” Mr. O’Malley said. “What percent of your users are coming back? How engaged are they? Are they a ‘sticky’ user?”That dose of reality may be healthy. Mr. Lee of SV Angel said that 18 months ago, every other business pitch he heard was social, local or mobile. Today, he sees more diverse company ideas and more durable, predictable business models.“Now companies that have a predictable business model, or a way of getting engaged users, and global, addressable markets are the companies getting the lofty valuations,” Mr. Lee said. But, he added, “that’s making me more cheap.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/nyregion/house-to-take-up-sandy-relief-bill-amid-battle-over-spending.html,"WASHINGTON — The House will move ahead this week with a multibillion-dollar package to provide aid to victims of Hurricane Sandy, but the legislation is already caught in an escalating debate over spending and deficits that foreshadows another ugly fight among Republicans.Squeezed between the demands of Northeastern Republicans and conservatives, House Republican leaders have orchestrated a legislative approach that they say will allow $50 billion in aid to be approved on Tuesday.A bare-bones package totaling $17 billion would come to a vote first, followed by a $33.7 billion amendment written by New Jersey and New York Republicans. That way House conservatives can vote for some, but not all, of the assistance, which ultimately would rely on Democratic votes to push it to the finish.The $33.7 billion installment is facing severe resistance because some of it would go to projects and programs far from the hurricane disaster zone, and much of it, although related to Hurricane Sandy, can barely be considered emergency aid.The list of nonemergency items is considerable: $25 million to improve weather forecasting and hurricane intensity predictions; $118 million for Amtrak’s Northeast corridor, with only $32 million for storm-related repairs; $16 billion in development funds for any community declared a disaster zone from 2011 to 2013; and $2 billion for highway spending nationwide.“There are a core of items that truly meet vital needs,” said Steve Ellis, the vice president of the nonpartisan Taxpayers for Common Sense. “But that is overshadowed by the fact that billions of dollars have been added to things that should be paid for through the normal budget process.”Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, scheduled the vote in the House over a week ago after drawing sharp rebukes for adjourning the previous Congress last year without taking up a $60.4 billion aid bill that the Senate had passed to finance recovery efforts in the hurricane-battered states.Several prominent Northeastern Republicans were among the loudest critics, including Representative Peter T. King of Long Island, N.Y., and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, who is a possible presidential contender in 2016.To be sure, House Republicans have removed a number of items included in the Senate bill that vaguely resembled pork-barrel spending and were included to win enough votes in that chamber to ensure the bill’s passage late last year.Among the items removed were $150 million for fisheries in Alaska and Mississippi and $56 million for the West Coast to clean up debris from the 2011 tsunami in Japan. But while their removal was intended to mollify fiscal conservatives in the House, it might undermine support for the package in the Senate.Even so, the House debate will most likely become messy — and passage may still be threatened by the minefield of amendments the bill will probably face on Tuesday. Passage of any of those amendments could imperil the package’s prospects for quick approval in the Senate.By the House Rules Committee’s deadline for amendments at 4 p.m. Friday, some 92 had been submitted, most to either cut spending in the package or demand cuts elsewhere in the budget. Some amendments are quick strikes, like eliminating $111 million for improving weather satellite technology. Other amendments are more ambitious, like one proposed by a group of conservatives calling for cuts in other popular programs to pay for the relief package. (A senior Democratic Senate aide said such a move would imperil the overall package in that chamber.)“We’d rather not have to deal with any of these amendments,” Mr. King said. “But I am confident that we will be able to defeat any amendments that come up for a vote.”Supporters of the larger aid package say that many of the items are legitimate and that critics are misconstruing them. For instance, under the larger bill, drafted by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, Republican of New Jersey, $16 billion in development funds would be designated for any community declared a disaster zone between 2011 and 2013; that includes 47 states and Puerto Rico. And $2 billion is set aside for highway spending nationwide.In both those cases, an aide explained, federal rules make those huge infusions necessary if money is to get to New York and New Jersey. Highways needing repair after the storm, for instance, fall to the back of the line of projects still awaiting assistance after earlier disasters. Only by financing those previous projects can lawmakers rush aid to the Northeast storm zone.Supporters also point to the $118 million for Amtrak’s Northeast corridor. While acknowledging that only $32 million would go to hurricane-related repairs, they note that the rest would go to bolstering the system’s ability to withstand future storms, as well as to long-planned improvements.Mr. Ellis, of the taxpayers’ group, said that previous disaster bills taken up by Congress had been stuffed with more flagrant examples of pork-barrel spending. But, he said, the Hurricane Sandy bill followed a pattern established in the era of Tom DeLay, the House Republican leader from 2003 to 2005: Congress adopts hard caps on spending to prove its fiscal discipline, then uses emergency spending bills to get around those caps.“Don’t get me wrong,” Mr. Ellis said, “this is better than business as usual because these things are normally bigger Christmas trees.”“But,” he added, “because of our nation’s dire fiscal situation, we cannot afford anything remotely resembling business as usual anymore.”"

Instead, they went home with their first loss.Michigan (16-1, 3-1 Big Ten) trailed by 52-50 when Burke, a former star at Northland High School in Columbus, Ohio, narrowly missed from 3-point range. Lenzelle Smith Jr. grabbed the rebound, was fouled and made two free throws to help the Buckeyes (13-3, 3-1) deny Michigan its first 17-0 start. The 1985-86 Wolverines also won their first 16 games.Ohio State did most of its damage early, going on a 16-0 run that started and ended with baskets by Deshaun Thomas, who led the team with 20 points. The Buckeyes led, 34-22, at halftime.Burke led Michigan with 15 points, and Tim Hardaway Jr. added 12. The Wolverines battled back in the second half as they switched defenses, causing matchup problems for the Buckeyes.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/us/politics/full-transcript-of-president-obamas-press-conference.html,"The following is the complete transcript of President Obama’s press conference on Monday in Washington. (Transcript courtesy of Federal News Service.)PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Please, have a seat, everybody. Good morning. I thought it might make sense to take some questions this week, as my first term comes to an end.It’s been a busy and productive four years, and I expect the same from the next four years. I intend to carry out the agenda that I campaigned on, an agenda for new jobs, new opportunity and new security for the middle class.Now right now our economy is growing, and our businesses are creating new jobs. So we are poised for a good year -- if we make smart decisions, sound investments, and as long as Washington politics don’t get in the way of America’s progress.As I said on the campaign, one component to growing our economy and broadening opportunity for the middle class is shrinking our deficits in a balanced and responsible way. And for nearly two years now I’ve been fighting for such a plan, one that would reduce our deficits by $4 trillion over the next decade, which would stabilize our debt and our deficit in a sustainable way for the next decade.That would be enough not only to stop the growth of our debt relative to the size of our economy, but it would make it manageable so it doesn’t crowd out the investments we need to make in people and education and job training and science and medical research -- all the things that help us grow.Now, step by step, we’ve made progress towards that goal. Over the past two years, I’ve signed into law about $1.4 trillion in spending cuts. Two weeks ago, I signed into law more than $600 billion in new revenue by making sure the wealthiest Americans begin to pay their fair share.When you add the money it will save in interest payments on the debt, all together that adds up to a total of about $2.5 trillion in deficit reduction over the past two years -- not counting the $400 billion already saved from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. So we’ve made progress. We are moving towards our ultimate goal of getting to a $4 trillion reduction. And there will be more deficit reduction when Congress decides what to do about the $1.2 trillion in automatic spending cuts that have been pushed off until next month.The fact is, though, we can’t finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone. The cuts we’ve already made to priorities other than Medicare, Medicaid, Social Security and Defense mean that we spend, on everything from education to public safety, less, as a share of our economy, than it has -- than has been true for a generation, and that’s not a recipe for growth. So we’ve got to do more both to stabilize our finances over the medium and long term, but also spur more growth in the short term.Now, I’ve said I’ve -- I’m open to making modest adjustments to programs like Medicare to protect them for future generations.I’ve also said that we need more revenue, through tax reform, by closing loopholes in our tax code for the wealthiest Americans. If we combine a balanced package of savings from spending on health care and revenues from closing loopholes, we can solve the deficit issue without sacrificing our investments in things like education that are going to help us grow.Turns out the American people agree with me. They listened to an entire year’s debate over this issue, and they made a clear decision about the approach they prefer. They don’t think it’s fair, for example, to ask a senior to pay more for his or her health care or a scientist to shut down lifesaving research so that a multimillionaire investor can pay less in tax rates than a secretary. They don’t think it’s smart to protect endless corporate loopholes and tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans rather than rebuild our roads and our schools, invest in our workers’ skills or help manufacturers bring jobs back to America.So they want us to get our books in order in a balanced way, where everybody pulls their weight, everyone does their part. That’s what I want as well. That’s what I’ve proposed. And we can get it done, but we’re going to have to make sure that people are looking at this in a responsible way rather than just through the lens of politics.Now, the other congressionally imposed deadline coming up is the so-called debt ceiling, something most Americans hadn’t even heard of before two years ago. So I want to be clear about this: The debt ceiling is not a question of authorizing more spending. Raising the debt ceiling does not authorize more spending. It simply allows the country to pay for spending that Congress has already committed to.These are bills that have already been racked up, and we need to pay them. So while I’m willing to compromise and find common ground over how to reduce our deficits, America cannot afford another debate with this Congress about whether or not they should pay the bills they’ve already racked up.If congressional Republicans refuse to pay America’s bills on time, Social Security checks and veterans’ benefits will be delayed. We might not be able to pay our troops or honor our contracts with small business owners. Food inspectors, air traffic controllers, specialists who track down loose nuclear materials wouldn’t get their paychecks. Investors around the world will ask if the United States of America is in fact a safe bet. Markets could go haywire. Interest rates would spike for anybody who borrows money, every homeowner with a mortgage, every student with a college loan, every small business owner who wants to grow and hire. It would be a self-inflicted wound on the economy. It would slow down our growth, might tip us into recession, and ironically, would probably increase our deficit.So to even entertain the idea of this happening, of the United States of America not paying its bills, is irresponsible. It’s absurd. As the speaker said two years ago, it would be -- and I’m quoting Speaker Boehner now -- “a financial disaster not only for us but for the worldwide economy.” So we got to pay our bills. And Republicans in Congress have two choices here: They can act responsibly and pay America’s bills or they can act irresponsibly and put America through another economic crisis.But they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy. The financial well-being of the American people is not leverage to be used. The full faith and credit of the United States of America is not a bargaining chip.And they’d better choose quickly because time is running short. The last time Republicans in Congress even flirted with this idea, our triple-A credit rating was downgraded for the first time in our history, our businesses created the fewest jobs of any month in nearly the past three years, and ironically, the whole fiasco actually added to the deficit.So it shouldn’t be surprising, given all this talk, that the American people think Washington is hurting rather than helping the country at the moment. They see their representatives consumed with partisan brinksmanship over paying our bills while they overwhelmingly want us to focus on growing the economy and creating more jobs.So let’s finish this debate. Let’s give our businesses and the world the certainty that our economy and our reputation are still second to none. We pay our bills, we handle our business, and then we can move on because America has a lot to do. We’ve got to create more jobs. We’ve got to boost the wages of those who have work. And we’ve got to reach for energy independence. We’ve got to reform our immigration system. We’ve got to give our children the best education possible, and we’ve got to do everything we can to protect them from the horrors of gun violence. And let me say I’m grateful to Vice -- Vice President Biden for his work on this issue of gun violence and for his proposals, which I’m going to be reviewing today and I will address in the next few days, and I intend to vigorously pursue.So with that, I’m going to take some questions, and I’m going to start with Julie Pace of AP, and I want to congratulate Julie for this new important job.Q: Thank you very much.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: I wanted to ask about gun violence. Today marks the one-year -- or one-month anniversary of the shooting in Newtown, which seemed to generate some momentum for reinstating the assault weapons ban. But there’s been fresh opposition to that ban from the NRA, and even Harry Reid has said that he questions whether it could pass Congress. Given that, how hard will you push for an assault weapons ban? And if one cannot pass Congress, what other measures would need to be included in a broad package in order to curb gun violence successfully?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I said, the vice president and a number of members of my Cabinet went through a very thorough process over the last month, meeting with a lot of stakeholders in this, including the NRA, listened to proposals from all quarters. And they’ve presented me now with a list of sensible, common-sense steps that can be taken to make sure that the kinds of violence we saw at Newtown doesn’t happen again.I’m going to be meeting with the vice president today. I expect to have a fuller presentation later in the week to give people some specifics about what I think we need to do. My starting point is not to worry about the politics. My starting point is to focus on what makes sense, what works. What should we be doing to make sure that our children are safe and that we’re reducing the incidence of gun violence? And I think we can do that in a sensible way that comports with the Second Amendment.And then members of Congress, I think, are going to have to have a debate and examine their own conscience because, you know, if, in fact -- and I believe this is true -- everybody across party lines was as deeply moved and -- and -- and saddened as I was by what happened in Newtown, then we’re going to have to vote based on what we think is best.We’re going to have to come up with answers that set politics aside, and that’s what I expect Congress to do.But I -- but I -- what you can count on is, is that the things that I’ve said in the past -- the belief that we have to have stronger background checks, that we can do a much better job in terms of keeping these magazine clips with high capacity out of the hands of folks who shouldn’t have them, an assault weapons ban that is meaningful -- that those are things I continue to believe make sense.(Inaudible) -- will all of them get through this Congress? I don’t know. But what’s uppermost in my mind is making sure that I’m honest with the American people and with members of Congress about what I think will work, what I think is -- is something that will make a difference. And to repeat what I’ve said earlier, if there is a step we can take that will save even one child from what happened in Newtown, we should take that step.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: I’ll -- I’ll present the details later in the week.Chuck Todd, NBC.Q: As you know, the Senate Democrats, Harry Reid sent you a letter begging you, essentially, to take -- consider some sort of executive action on this debt ceiling issue. I know you’ve said you’re not negotiating on it. Your administration has ruled out the various ideas that have been out there, the 14th Amendment, but just this morning House -- one of the House Democratic leaders, Jim Clyburn, asked you to use the 14th Amendment, and even said sometimes that’s what it takes. He brought up the Emancipation Proclamation, saying it took executive action when Congress wouldn’t act, and he compared the debt ceiling to that.So are you considering a Plan B? And if not, why not?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Chuck, the issue here is whether or not America pays its bills. We are not a deadbeat nation. And so there’s a very simple solution to this. Congress authorizes us to pay our bills.Now if the House and the Senate want to give me the authority so that they don’t have to take these tough votes, if they want to put the responsibility on me to raise the debt ceiling, I’m happily (sic) to take it. Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader in the Senate, had a proposal like that last year, and I’m happy to accept it.But if they want to keep this responsibility, then they need to go ahead and get it done. And you know, there are no magic tricks here. There are no loopholes. There are no, you know, easy outs. This is a matter of Congress authorizes spending. They order me to spend. They tell me: You need to fund our Defense Department at such-and-such a level. You need to send Social Security checks. You need to make sure that you are paying to care for our veterans.They lay all this out for me, and -- because they have the spending power. And so I am required by law to go ahead and pay these bills.Separately, they also have to authorize a raising of the debt ceiling in order to make sure that those bills are paid. And so what Congress can’t do is tell me to spend X and then say, but we’re not going to give you the authority to go ahead and pay the bills.And -- and I just want to repeat, because I think sometimes the American people understandably aren’t following all -- all the debates here in Washington, raising the debt ceiling does not authorize us to spend more. All it does is say that America will pay its bills. And we are not a deadbeat nation. And the consequences of us not paying our bills, as I outlined in my opening statement, would be disastrous.So I understand the impulse to try to get around this in a simple way. But there’s one way to get around this. There’s one way to deal with it, and that is for Congress to authorize me to pay for those items of spending that they have already authorized.And you know, the notion that Republicans in the House or maybe some Republicans in the Senate would suggest that in order for us to get our way on our spending priorities that we would risk the full faith and credit of the United States -- that, I think, is not what the founders intended. That’s not how I think most Americans think our democracy should work. You know, they’ve got a point of view. Democrats in Congress have a point of view. They need to sit down and -- and work out a compromise.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: So if you’re not negotiating and they say you have to negotiate and you’re not considering another plan B, do you think we should wait it out and -- (off mic)?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, look, Chuck, there -- there are -- there’s a pretty straightforward way of doing this, and that is to set the debt ceiling aside, we pay our bills and then we have a vigorous debate about how we’re going to do further deficit reduction in a balanced way.I keep in mind that, you know, what we’ve heard from some Republicans in both the House and the Senate is that they will only increase the debt ceiling by the amount of spending cuts that they’re able to push through. And in order to replace the automatic spending cut, the sequester, that’s $1.2 trillion. Say it takes another trillion (dollars) or trillion two to get us through one more year. They’d have to identify $2.5 trillion in cuts just to get the debt ceiling extended to next year -- 2.5 trillion (dollars).They can’t even -- Congress has not been able to identify $1.2 trillion in cuts that they’re happy with, because these same Republicans say they don’t want to cut defense. They claim that they don’t want to gut Medicare or harm the vulnerable, but the truth of the matter is, is that you can’t meet their own criteria without drastically cutting Medicare or having an impact on Medicaid or affecting our defense spending. So the math just doesn’t add up.Now, what -- here’s what would work. What would work would be for us to say, we’ve already done close to $2 trillion in deficit reduction, and if you add the interest that we won’t be paying because of less spending and increased revenue, it adds up to about $2.5 trillion.The consensus is we need about $4 trillion to stabilize our debt and our deficit, which means we need about $1.5 trillion more. The package that I offered to Speaker Boehner before we -- before the new year would achieve that. We were actually fairly close in terms of arriving at that number.So -- so if the goal is to make sure that we are being responsible about our debt and our deficit, if that’s the conversation we’re having, I’m happy to have that conversation. And by closing some additional loopholes through tax reform -- which Speaker Boehner has acknowledged can raise money in a sensible way -- and by doing some additional cuts, including making sure that we are reducing our health care spending, which is the main driver of our deficits, we can arrive at a package to get this thing done. I’m happy to have that conversation.What I will not do is to have that negotiation with a gun at the head of the American people; the threat that unless we get our way, unless you gut Medicare or Medicaid or, you know, otherwise slash things that the American people don’t believe should be slashed, that we’re going to threaten to wreck the entire economy. That is not how historically this has been done. That’s not how we’re going to do it this time.Q: There’s no plan -- (off mic) -- you’re not searching for any other ideas, or are you --PRESIDENT OBAMA: What -- what -- what I’m --Q: -- let me ask -- (inaudible).PRESIDENT OBAMA: Chuck, what I’m saying to you is that there is no simpler solution; no ready, credible solution other than Congress either give me the authority to raise the debt ceiling, or exercise the responsibility that they have kept for themselves and raise the debt ceiling, because this is about paying your bills.Everybody -- everybody here understands this. I mean, this is not a complicated concept. You don’t go out to dinner and then, you know, eat all you want and then leave without paying the check. And if you do, you’re breaking the law.And Congress is -- should think about it the same way that the American people do. You don’t -- now if -- if Congress wants to have a debate about maybe we shouldn’t go out to dinner next time, maybe we should go to a more modest restaurant, that’s fine. That -- that’s a debate that we should have. But you don’t -- you don’t say, in order for me to control my appetites, I’m going to not pay the people who are provided me services, people who already lent me the money. That -- that’s not -- that’s not showing any discipline. All that’s doing is not meeting your obligations. You can’t do that.And -- and -- and -- and that’s not a credible way to run this government. We -- we’ve got to stop lurching from crisis to crisis to crisis when there’s this clear path ahead of us that simply requires some discipline, some responsibility and some compromise. That’s where we need to go. That’s how this needs to work.Major Garrett.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. As you well know, sir, finding votes for the debt ceiling can sometimes be complicated.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.Q: You yourself, as a member of the Senate, voted against a debt ceiling increase.And in previous aspects of American history, President Reagan in 1985, President George Herbert Walker Bush in 1990, President Clinton in 1997 all signed deficit reduction deals that were contingent upon or in the context of raising the debt ceiling.You, yourself, four times have done that. Three times, those were related to deficit reduction or budget maneuvers. What Chuck and I and, I think, many people are curious about is this new adamant desire on your part not to negotiate when that seems to conflict with the entire history of the modern era of American presidents in the debt ceiling and your own history in the debt ceiling. And doesn’t that suggest that we are going to go until a default situation? Because no one is talking to each other about how to resolve this.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, no, Major. I -- I think if you look at the history, getting votes for the debt ceiling is always difficult, and budgets in this town are always difficult. I went through this just last year, but what’s different is we never saw a situation, as we saw last year, in which certain groups in Congress took such an absolutist position that we came within a few days of defaulting. And you know, the fact of the matter is, is that we have never seen the debt ceiling used in this fashion, where the notion was, you know what, we might default unless we get a hundred percent of what we want. That’s hasn’t happened.Now, as I indicated before, I’m happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits further in a sensible way. Although one thing I want to point is that the American people are also concerned about how we grow our economy, how we put people back to work, how we make sure that we finance our workers getting properly trained and our schools are giving our kids the education we deserve. There’s a whole growth agenda which will reduce our deficits that’s important as well.But what you’ve never seen is the notion that has been presented so far, at least, by the Republicans, that deficit reduction will only count spending cuts, that we will raise the deficit -- or the debt ceiling dollar for dollar on spending cuts. There are a whole set of rules that have been established that are impossible to meet without doing severe damage to the economy.And so what we’re not going to do is put ourselves in a position where in order to pay for spending that we’ve already incurred that our two options are we’re either going to profoundly hurt the economy and hurt middle-class families and hurt seniors and hurt kids who are trying to go to college or, alternatively, we’re going to blow up the economy. We’re not going to do that.Q: (Off mic) -- whatever Congress says, you’re OK with it?PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, not whatever Congress says. I mean, they’re going to send me something that’s sensible. And we shouldn’t be doing this --Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: -- then we should -- and we shouldn’t be doing this on a one-to-three-month time frame. Why would we do that? This is the United States of America, Major. What, we can’t manage our affairs in such a way that we pay our bills and we provide some certainty in terms of how we pay our bills? Look, I don’t think anybody would consider my position unreasonable here. The -- I have --Q: (Off mic) -- talk about this on a daily basis because if default -- (off mic) -- why not talk about it --PRESIDENT OBAMA: Major, the -- I am happy to have a conversation about how we reduce our deficits. I am not going to have a monthly or every three months conversation about whether or not we pay our bills because that in and of itself does severe damage.Even the threat of default hurts our economy. It’s hurting our economy as we speak. We shouldn’t be having that debate. If we want to have a conversation about how to reduce our deficit, let’s have that.We’ve been having that for the last two years. We had -- just had an entire campaign about it. And by the way, the American people agreed with me that we should reduce our deficits in a balanced way that also takes into account the need for us to grow this economy and put people back to work.And despite that conversation and despite the election results, the position that’s been taken on the part of some House Republicans is that no, we got to do it our way. And if we don’t, we simply won’t pay America’s bills. Well, you know, that can’t be -- that can’t be a position that is sustainable over time. It’s not one that’s good for the economy now. It’s certainly not going to be the kind of precedent that I want to establish, not just for my presidency but for future presidents -- even if it was on the other side. Democrats don’t like voting for the debt ceiling with a Republican’s president, and yet you -- you -- but you -- but you never saw a situation in which the Democrats suggested somehow that we would go ahead and default if we didn’t get a hundred percent of our way. That’s just not how it’s supposed to work.Jon Karl.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. On the issue of guns, given how difficult it will be, some would say impossible, to get any gun control measure passed through this Congress, what are you willing or able to do using the powers of your presidency to act without Congress? And I’d also like to know, what do you make of these long lines we’re seeing at gun shows and gun stores all around the country? I mean, even in Connecticut, applications for guns are up since the shooting in Newtown.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, my understanding is, the vice president’s going to provide a range of steps that we can take to reduce gun violence. Some of them will require legislation; some of them I can accomplish through executive action.And so I’ll be reviewing those today, and as I said, I’ll speak in more detail to what we’re going to go ahead and propose later in the week.But I’m confident that there are some steps that we can take that don’t require legislation and that are within my authority as president. And where you get a step that has the opportunity to reduce the possibility of gun violence, then I want to go ahead and take it.Q: Any idea of what the time frame for that is?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think, for example, how we are gathering data, for example, on guns that fall into the hands of criminals and how we track that more effectively -- there may be some steps that we can take administratively, as opposed -- through legislation.As far as people lining up and purchasing more guns, you know, I think that we’ve seen for some time now that those who oppose any common-sense gun control or gun safety measures have a pretty effective way of ginning up fear on the part of gun owners that somehow the federal government’s about to take all your guns away. And you know, that -- there’s probably an economic element to that. It obviously is good for business.But I think that, you know, those of us who look at this problem have repeatedly said that responsible gun owners, people who have a gun for protection, for hunting, for sportsmanship -- they don’t have anything to worry about. The issue here is not whether or not we believe in the Second Amendment.The issue is, are there some sensible steps that we can take to make sure that somebody like the individual in Newtown can’t walk into a school and gun down a bunch of children in a -- in a shockingly rapid fashion? And surely we can do something about that.And -- but -- you know, but -- but part of the challenge that, you know, we confront is, is that even the sight -- slightest hint of some sensible, responsible legislation in this area stands this notion that somehow here it comes and that everybody’s guns are going to be taken away.It’s unfortunate, but that’s the case, and if you look at -- over the first four years of my administration, we’ve tried to tighten up and enforce some of the laws that were already on the books. But it’d be pretty hard to argue that somehow gun owners have had their rights infringed.Q: (Off mic) -- irrational fear that’s driving all these people to go and -- (off mic) --PRESIDENT OBAMA: Excuse me?Q: Do you think it’s an irrational fear -- (off mic) --PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I said, I think it’s a fear that’s fanned by those who are -- are worried about the possibility of any legislation getting out there.Julianna Goldman.Q: Thank you, Mr. President. I want to come back to the debt ceiling, because in the summer of 2011, you said that you wouldn’t negotiate on the debt ceiling, and you did. Last year you said that you wouldn’t extend any of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, and you did. So as you say now that you’re not going to negotiate on the debt ceiling this year, why should House Republicans take that seriously and think that if we get to the one-minute-to-midnight scenario that you’re not going to back down?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, Julianna, let’s take the example of this year and the fiscal cliff. I didn’t say that I would not have any conversations at all about extending the Bush tax cuts. What I said was, we weren’t going to extend Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. And we didn’t.Now, you can argue that during the campaign I said -- I set the criteria for wealthy at 250(,000 dollars) and we ended up being at 400(,000 dollars), but the fact of the matter is, millionaires, billionaires are paying significantly more in taxes, just as I said. So for -- for -- you know, from the start, my concern was making sure that we had a tax code that was fair and that protected the middle class, and my biggest priority was making sure the middle-class taxes did not go up.You know, the difference between this year and 2011 is the fact that we’ve already made $1.2 trillion in cuts. And at the time, I indicated that there cuts that we could sensibly make that would not damage our economy, would not impede growth. I said at the time I think we should pair it up with revenue in order to have an overall balanced package. But my own budget reflected cuts in discretionary spending. My own budget reflected the cuts that needed to be made. And we’ve made those cuts.Now, the challenge going forward is that we’ve now made some big cuts, and if we’re going to do further deficit reduction, the only way to do it is in a balanced and responsible way. The alternative is for us to go ahead and cut commitments that we’ve made on things like Medicare or Social Security or Medicaid, and for us to fundamentally change commitments that we’ve made to make sure that seniors don’t go into poverty or that children that are disabled are properly cared for.For us to change that contract we’ve made with the American people, rather than look at options like closing loopholes for corporations that they don’t need, that points to a long-term trend in which, you know, we have fundamentally, I think, undermined what people expect out of this government, which is that parties sit down, they negotiate, they compromise, but they also reflect the will of the American people, that you don’t have one narrow faction that is able to simply dictate 100 percent of what they want all the time, or otherwise threaten that we destroy the American economy.Another way of putting it is, we got to break the habit of negotiating through crisis over and over again. And now we -- now’s as good of a time as any, at the start of my second term, because if we continue down this path, then there’s really no stopping the principle. I mean, literally -- even in divided government, even where we’ve got a Democratic president and a Democratic Senate, then a small group in the House of Representatives could simply say, you know, every two months, every three months, every six months, every year, we are going to more and more change the economy in ways that we prefer, despite strong objections of Americans all across the country, or otherwise we’re going to have America not pay its bills.And you know, that is no way for us to do business.And by the way, I would make the same argument if it was a Republican president and a Republican Senate and you had a handful of Democrats who were suggesting that we are going to hijack the process and make sure that either we get our way a hundred percent of the time or otherwise, you know, we are going to default on America’s obligations.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, no, look, what I’ve said is is that I’m happy to have a conversation about deficit reduction.Q: So you technically are willing to negotiate.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Nope. Julianna, look, this is pretty straightforward. Either Congress pays its bills, or it doesn’t. Now, if -- and they want to keep this responsibility. If John Boehner and Mitch McConnell think that they can come up with a plan that somehow meets that their criteria that they’ve set for why they will -- when they will raise the debt ceiling, they’re free to go ahead and try. But the proposals that they’ve put forward in order to accomplish that only by cutting spending means cuts to things like Medicare and education that the American people profoundly reject.Now, if they think that they can get that through Congress, then they’re free to try. But I think that a better way of doing this is to go ahead and say, we’re going to pay our bills; the question now is how do we actually get our deficit in a manageable, sustainable way. And that’s a conversation I’m happy to have.All right, Matt Spetalnick.Q: Thank you, sir. You’ve spoke extensively about the debt ceiling debate, but some Republicans have further said that they’re willing to allow a government shutdown to take place rather than put off deep spending cuts. Are you prepared to allow the government to grind to a halt if you disagree with the spending cut proposals they put forth? And who do you think the American people would blame if that came to pass?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, ultimately Congress makes the decisions about whether or not we spend money and whether or we keep this government open. And if the Republicans in Congress have made a decision that they want to shut down the government in order to get their way, then they have the votes at least in the House of Representatives, probably, to do that. I think that would be a mistake. I think it would be profoundly damaging to our economy. I think it would actually add to our deficit because it will impede growth. I think it’s shortsighted.But they’re elected representatives, and folks put them into -- into those positions, and they’re going to have to make a decision about that.And I don’t -- I suspect that the American people would blame all of Washington for not being able to get its act together.But -- but the larger issue here has to do with what is it that we’re trying to accomplish. Are we trying to reduce the deficit? Because if we’re trying to reduce the deficit, then we can shape a bipartisan plan to reduce the deficit. I mean, is that -- is that really our objective? Our concern is that we’re spending more than we take in, and if that’s the case, then there’s a way of balancing that out so that we take in more money, increasing revenue, and we reduce spending. And -- and there’s a recipe for getting that done.And in the conversation that I had with Speaker Boehner before the end of the year, we came pretty close. I mean, a few hundred billion dollars separating us, when stretched out over a 10-year period, that’s not a lot.But it seems as if what’s motivating and propelling at this point some of the House Republicans is more than simply deficit reduction. They have a particular vision about what government should and should not do. So they are suspicious about government’s commitments, for example, to make sure that seniors have decent health care as they get older. They have suspicions about Social Security. They have suspicions about whether government should make sure that kids in poverty are getting enough to eat or whether we should be spending money on medical research. So they -- they got a particular view of what government should do and -- and should be.And that view was rejected by the American people when it was debated during the presidential campaign. I think every poll that’s out there indicates that the American people actually think our commitment to Medicare or to education is really important, and that’s something that we should look at at as a last resort in terms of reducing the deficit, and it makes a lot more sense for us to close, for example, corporate loopholes before we go to putting a bigger burden on students or seniors.But if the House Republicans disagree with that and they want to shut down the government to see if they can get their way on it, that’s their -- that’s their prerogative. That’s how the system is set up. It will damage our economy. You know, the -- the government is a big part of this economy.And it’s interesting that a lot of times you have people who recognize that when it comes to defense spending, you know, some of the same folks who say, we got to cut spending or complain that, you know, government jobs don’t do anything, when it comes to that defense contractor in their district, they think, wow, this is -- this is pretty important part of the economy in my district and we shouldn’t stop spending on that; let’s just make sure we’re not spending on those other folks.Q: (Off mic)?PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, my -- you know, look, my hope is, is that common sense prevails, you know? That’s always my -- my preference, and I think that would be the preference of the American people, and that’s what would be good for the economy.So -- so let me just, you know, repeat: If the issue is deficit reduction, getting our deficits sustainable over time, getting our debt in a sustainable place, then Democrats and Republicans in Congress will have a partner with me. We can achieve that and, you know, we can achieve it fairly quickly. I mean, we know what the numbers are; we know what needs to be done. We know what a balanced approach would take, and we’ve already done probably more than half of the deficit reduction we need to stabilize the debt and the deficit. There’s probably been more pain and drama in getting there than we needed.And so finishing the job shouldn’t -- shouldn’t be that difficult if everybody comes to the -- the conversation with an open mind and if we recognize that there are some things, like not paying our bills, that -- that should be out-of-bounds.All right? I’m going to take one last question. Jackie Calmes.Q: Thank you, Mr. President.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yep.Q: I’d like to ask you, now that you’ve reached the end of your first term, starting your second, about a couple of criticisms, one that’s long-standing, another more recent.The long-standing one seems to have become a truism of sorts, that you’re -- you and your staff are too insular, that you don’t socialize enough. And the second, the more recent criticism, is that you’re team taking shape isn’t diverse -- isn’t as diverse as it could be or even was in terms of getting additional voices, gender, race, ethnic diversity. So I’d like you to address both of those.PRESIDENT OBAMA: Sure. Let me take the -- the -- the second one first. You know, I’m very proud that in the first four years we had as diverse, if not more diverse, a White House and a Cabinet than any in history. And I intend to continue that because it turns out that when you look for the very best people, given the incredible diversity of this country, you’re going to end up with a diverse staff and diverse -- a diverse team, and that very diversity helps to create more effective policymaking and better decision-making for me because it brings different perspectives to the table.So if you think about my first four years, the person who probably had the most influence on my foreign policy was a woman. The people who were in charge of moving forward my most important domestic initiative, health care, were women. The person in charge of our homeland security was a woman. My two appointments to the Supreme Court were women. And 50 percent of my White House staff were women. So I think people should expect that that record will be built upon during the next four years.Now, what, I’ve made four appointments so far? And one woman, admittedly a high-profile one, is leaving the -- has already left the administration, and I have made a replacement.But I would just suggest that everybody kind of wait until they’ve seen all my appointments, who’s in the White House staff and who’s in my Cabinet, before they rush to judgment.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: But I -- I guess what I’m saying, Jack, is, is that I think until you’ve seen what my overall team looks like, it’s premature to assume that somehow we’re going backwards. We’re not going backwards, we’re going forward.With respect to this truism about me not socializing enough and patting folks on the back and all that stuff, most people who know me know I’m -- I’m a pretty friendly guy. And I like a good party. And you know, the truth is that, you know, when I was in the Senate, I had great relationships over there, and up until the point that I became president, this was not an accusation that you heard very frequently.I think that -- I think that really what’s gone on in terms of some of the paralysis here in Washington or difficulties in negotiations just have to do with some very stark differences in terms of policy, some very sharp differences in terms of where we stand on issues. And you know, if you think about, let’s say, myself and Speaker Boehner, I like Speaker Boehner personally. And you know, when we went out and played golf, we had a great time, but that didn’t get a deal done in 2011. You know, when I’m over here at the congressional picnic and folks are coming up and taking pictures with their family, I promise you, Michelle and I are very nice to them, and we have a wonderful time -- (scattered laughter) -- but it doesn’t prevent them from going under the floor of the House and, you know, blasting me for being a big-spending socialist.You know -- and the reason that, you know, in many cases, Congress votes the way they do, or talks the way they talk, or takes positions and negotiations that they take -- it doesn’t have to do with me, it has to do with the imperatives that they feel in terms of their own politics, right? They’re worried about their district. They’re worried about what’s going on back home. I think there are a lot of Republicans at this point that feel that, given how much energy has been devoted in some of the media that’s preferred by Republican constituencies to demonize me, that it doesn’t look real good socializing with me. Charlie Crist down in Florida, I think, testifies to that, and I think a lot of folks say, well, you know, if we look like we’re being too cooperative or too chummy with the president, that might cause us problems. That might be an excuse for us to get a challenge from somebody in a primary. So that tends to be the challenge.I promise you, we invite folks from Congress over here all the time. And I -- and when they choose to come, I enjoy their company. Sometimes, they don’t choose to come, and that has to do with the fact that I think they don’t consider the optics useful for them, politically.And -- and ultimately the way we’re going to get stuff done -- personal relationships are important, and obviously I can always do a better job, and the nice thing is, is that now that my girls are getting older, they don’t want to spend that much time with me anyway. (Laughter.) So I’ll be probably calling around, looking for somebody to play cards with or something, OK, I -- because I’m getting kind of lonely in this big house.Q: (Off mic.)PRESIDENT OBAMA: So maybe -- maybe a whole bunch of members of the House Republican caucus want to come over and socialize more.But my suspicion is, getting the issues resolved that we just talked about, the big stuff -- whether or not we get sensible laws passed to prevent gun violence, whether or not America’s paying its bills, whether or not we get immigration reform done -- all that’s going to be determined largely by where the respective parties stand on policy and, maybe most importantly, the attitude of the American people. Now if the American people feel strongly about these issues and they push hard and they reward or don’t reward members of Congress with their votes; if -- you know, if -- if -- if they reject sort of uncompromising positions or sharp partisanship or always looking out for the next election, and they reward folks who are trying to find common ground, then I think you’ll see behavior in Congress change. And that will be true whether I’m the life of the party or a stick-in- the-mud.All right.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/world/europe/francois-hollande-moves-away-from-his-image.html,"PARIS — President François Hollande of France has regularly been criticized as indecisive, even complacent. But the events of the last few days will go some way toward changing his image, as Mr. Hollande has moved swiftly to use the French military in Mali and Somalia after pulling off an important compromise with domestic unions over job creation.The sudden French military intervention in Mali, which took only half a day to set in motion, together with a bold, if failed, hostage rescue mission in Somalia, have displayed Mr. Hollande in a more somber, decisive light that could represent a turning point for his presidency. The French, like the Americans, judge presidents on their ability to make tough decisions, and there are few tougher ones than to send young soldiers into battle.While the future of the Mali intervention is unclear, it has begun well, with French forces hitting two columns of Islamist rebels with jet fighters and attack helicopters and appearing to halt a rebel march south toward the capital, Bamako. Mr. Hollande’s actions have garnered widespread political support in France and abroad, from African countries, the United States and Britain, all of which have promised to move more quickly to help Mali recover a vast piece of land lost months ago to the rebels.Even the failure of the raid in Somalia, in which two French commandos died and the hostage is believed to have been killed by his captors, does not seem to have hurt Mr. Hollande. Many of his countrymen do not expect warfare to be risk-free, and France is seized by both worries about the rise of radical Islam and the plight of several French hostages in North Africa believed to be held by religious extremists. “This is the first occasion Hollande had or seized upon to act decisively, without the sort of waffling that had appeared to be his trademark,” said François Heisbourg, a defense expert at the Foundation for Strategic Research in Paris. “So in that sense, it changes his image instantaneously.”Throughout his career in the Socialist Party, Mr. Hollande has been criticized and even ridiculed for being soft and compromising, likened in the early days to a wobbly custard dessert called “Flanby.” But he has always said that his critics underestimate him, and his victory last May over the energetic incumbent, Nicolas Sarkozy, surprised many.Now Mr. Hollande has “demonstrated that he can decide on matters of war and peace, which in the French system, as in the U.S., is very important,” Mr. Heisbourg said.“Until you prove that, you haven’t proved much,” he said, comparing the impact of Mr. Hollande’s actions with that of President Obama’s decision to approve the raid on Osama bin Laden.A cartoon on Saturday in the centrist newspaper Le Parisien showed Mr. Hollande as commander in chief, with a bystander saying, “Must admit that sometimes he surprises.”On Sunday, Bruno Jeudy, an editor at the newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche, wrote: “Finally president! Finished, the hesitant and nonchalant François Hollande of the first months of his mandate.” Like many, Mr. Jeudy noted that once begun, the operation in Mali — to help dismantle a safe haven for radicals linked to terrorist groups — will be long and difficult. (In the same newspaper, Dominique de Villepin, a former foreign minister, warned that the operation in Mali was likely to fail because it had too many ambitious goals.)“Wars are rarely popular,” Mr. Jeudy said. “But by putting on the uniform of a war leader, he rose to the rank of his predecessors.” He also lowered the domestic pressure on him to back off his proposal to legalize same-sex marriage, turning the national conversation more toward foreign policy.A week ago, all the talk in France was of the large demonstration called for Sunday against same-sex marriage. The proposed law has created significant opposition because it would allow married gay couples to adopt children. Religious leaders and many ordinary citizens are troubled by the proposal, and opposition parties have tried to make political capital out of opposition to the bill.Up to 340,000 demonstrators came out in Paris on Sunday to protest the bill, according to the police, while organizers gave a turnout of 800,000.Emmanuel Bogeat, 35, a lawyer, and his wife, Laetitia, 32, a teacher, came from Nice, upset about a move they believe would add instability to the troubled institution of the family. “This is once again hurting the family’s core,” Ms. Bogeat said.Mr. Bogeat said he knew the law would pass, “but it’s my duty, since I’m against it, to be here.”Like many, Alexis Ludeau, 24, who works at a university, is less opposed to same-sex marriage than to giving gay couples adoption rights, which he called dangerously experimental — “taking a bet.” The country’s real problem is debt and jobs, he said. “We see that our government isn’t in touch with what’s going on in France today.”Still, many of those on the right who oppose Mr. Hollande on same-sex marriage, including the main opposition party, the Union for a Popular Movement, support him on Mali and Somalia.Mr. Hollande, whose Socialist Party and its allies control the legislature, has vowed to push through the bill, saying that policy will not be made in the streets. But he has refused to allow some of his own legislators to attach a provision to allow state financing for procreation assistance to lesbian married couples. In both instances, Mr. Hollande has again shown his ability to make a decision and keep it, as well as working to manage his own party.Similarly, after months of negotiations, Mr. Hollande and his government were able to announce late Friday an agreement between entrepreneurs and trade unions over how to liberalize the labor market, to make it easier to hire young people, who are facing unemployment levels nearing 25 percent.While the details are vague, and the impact on unemployment may not be big, Mr. Hollande has managed to get some concessions from France’s famously strong unions without a strike. That was especially important for Mr. Hollande, given the ridicule produced by the actor Gérard Depardieu’s feud with the government over high taxes favored by the Socialists and a ruling that a 75 percent tax rate on the rich was unconstitutional.For Mr. Hollande to have succeeded with the unions and corporate leaders was vital. Failure would have been seen as disastrous for his ability to carry the country, however incrementally, toward improved competitiveness and lower budget deficits.There was even praise from a sharp critic, the business leader Laurence Parisot. The deal “will change life for businesses in France,” she said.“This marks the advent of a culture of compromise after decades of a philosophy of social antagonism,” she said.The complications of war are many, but for now, joked Mr. Heisbourg, the defense expert, it seems like “springtime in Holland,” a play on the president’s name. The French “don’t know yet if he’s really competent,” he said.“But he shows little sign of stress or unease, and he certainly looks relaxed.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/nyregion/thompsons-mayoral-campaign-raises-1-million-in-6-months.html,"In his strongest fund-raising showing yet, William C. Thompson Jr., who lost the mayor’s race to Michael R. Bloomberg in 2009, announced on Monday that his campaign had collected more than $1 million in the last six months.The figure — which did not include any details on spending — easily topped the amounts collected by his likely rivals for the Democratic nomination for New York City mayor. Then again, Mr. Thompson, a former city comptroller, had lagged behind the others in previous cycles, and was under the most pressure to demonstrate some momentum heading into the 2013 election.In a statement, Mr. Thompson said that he was “encouraged by this strong show of support” to “help us kick-start our campaign.”Mr. Thompson, who has raised approximately $2.5 million to date, still needs to continue to raise funds aggressively to qualify for the maximum possible amount of public money under the city’s voluntary and relatively generous campaign finance program. The program will allow candidates to spend no more than $6.73 million each in the primary, in part from money they raise and in part from matching funds.One likely contender, Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, has already reached the maximum for both the primary and a possible runoff. But even with her fund-raising operation scaled back, she still reported raising $473,000 in the last six months, ending on Jan. 11.Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, had another solid showing, pulling in $725,000, or just shy of his total during the previous cycle. He is also on track, aides say, to reach the maximum soon.John C. Liu, the comptroller, collected $522,000, and now has more than $2 million. But he evidently spent far more than anyone else in the last six months — $345,000, with much of that going to legal fees stemming from a federal investigation into his campaign fund-raising. Two allies of Mr. Liu’s are slated to go on trial next month.On the Republican side, George T. McDonald, an advocate for the homeless and the founder of the Doe Fund, reported raising $277,000. But it was not immediately clear how much of that was his own money.Figures for all the candidates in this year’s elections, including spending and other details, will be released by Tuesday by the city’s Campaign Finance Board. All 59 of the city’s top elected offices will be on the ballot."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/opinion/dont-skimp-on-hurricane-sandy-aid.html,"Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey made an impassioned pitch on Monday to his fellow Republicans in the House of Representatives to vote on Tuesday for almost $50 billion in Hurricane Sandy disaster relief. “New Jersey does not expect anything more than what was done for Louisiana and Alabama and Mississippi in Katrina, and what was done in Joplin, Mo., what was done in the floods in Iowa. We don’t expect anything more than that, but we will not accept anything less,” Mr. Christie said.It is now more than 11 weeks after the hurricane severely damaged a huge swath of New Jersey, New York and Connecticut, yet these states are still waiting for enough federal aid to repair and rebuild housing, businesses and transportation systems that were destroyed by the storm.After the Senate approved more than $60.4 billion in aid for the battered region in December, Speaker John Boehner and his Republicans in the House balked. They approved only $9.7 billion, mostly for flood insurance. On Tuesday, the House is expected to approve a smaller package of $17 billion that barely covers basic needs like temporary housing. A second vote on the remainder of the aid — a $33.7 billion package drafted by Representative Rodney Frelinghuysen, a New Jersey Republican, that would address major issues like rebuilding transportation systems and repairing flood control facilities — is also expected late Tuesday.Northeast Republicans were told on Monday that there might be as many as 15 amendments to reach the House floor, which would mean at least 15 chances to cut the financing or make the package unacceptable to the Senate. For Republicans refusing to help Sandy victims, it is worth remembering that disasters are not confined to one region of the country. Those who vote against aid now may well find their constituents desperate for assistance sometime soon."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/media/brandweeks-obituary-proves-premature.html,"A FAMILIAR name on Madison Avenue is making a kind of comeback.In this instance, the returning name does not belong to an agency or an executive but to an industry trade publication: Brandweek, which chronicled the world of consumer product marketing for almost two decades until its final issue in April 2011.When Brandweek disappeared, so, too, did its sibling, Mediaweek, which reported on media agencies and media companies. They were merged into the third of what had been a trio of trade journals, Adweek, as part of a new strategy by their owner, Prometheus Global Media.More recently, however, Prometheus has begun to reassess some of the changes that were introduced with the consolidation. For instance, nuts-and-bolts news about advertising agencies like account moves, which Adweek started to play down, was added back into the editorial mix.And this month, ads began appearing in Adweek that heralded the arrival in February of a new quarterly editorial feature — in print, online at adweek.com and in the iPad edition of Adweek — to be called Brandweek Report.“Brandweek is ‘back’ in a new way,” the ads begin. “Reimagined for 2013 as Adweek’s Brandweek Report series, it promises to be the must-read, must-share resource for large and small marketers alike.” Plans call for the Brandweek Report to fill most of the so-called feature well, or space for feature articles, in the issues of Adweek in which it will run.The initial Brandweek Report is scheduled to appear on Feb. 4, presenting what Adweek editors hope will become a new annual franchise: a look at the previous year’s best and worst brand extensions. Adweek is working with Parham Santana, a New York brand consulting agency, to determine the 10 most innovative — and 10 most perplexing — brand extensions of 2012.“The Brandweek content is valuable, and we got away from that,” James Cooper, executive editor of Adweek in New York, said in a telephone interview.“People have been asking us to cover that space,” he added, citing subject matter like “brands and chief marketing officers.”“It’s a rich area in terms of content,” Mr. Cooper said. “It’s where the money is.”The reports will bear the Brandweek title because “there’s a lot of value in the Brandweek nameplate,” Mr. Cooper said. “It’ll be nice to get more of that branding angle into Adweek.”Asked if the Mediaweek name could also be revived in some fashion, Mr. Cooper, who worked for Mediaweek before joining Adweek, replied: “People are constantly asking about those nameplates. If we can find a way, we’d definitely entertain that.”Kenneth Fadner, one of the three founders of Adweek, said the phrase Brandweek Report “seems a cumbersome name to me, but I suppose there is still equity left in the Brandweek name.”“I’d do something in that direction if I were they,” Mr. Fadner wrote in an e-mail on Monday, “but probably brand it differently.”Mr. Fadner demurred when asked if the industry would welcome back the Brandweek name, and possibly Mediaweek, because, he pointed out, “I have a conflict of interest.” He founded a company, MediaPost, that competes against Prometheus.An Adweek alumna who now works for MediaPost, Barbara Lippert, wrote in an e-mail on Monday that she thought readers would respond positively to the new iteration of Brandweek because “people love reunions and revivals.”“Brandweek becomes so much more compelling as a special report,” Ms. Lippert said, than it was in its final days as a stand-alone publication, when it was “wafer-thin” and “a sad metaphor for the economic times and the trade publishing industry.”The return in the new format “is not much of a gamble,” she added, and could lead to “possible reinvention.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/football/ravens-turn-focus-to-avenging-loss-to-patriots-that-still-stings.html,"OWINGS MILLS, Md. — Baltimore Ravens defensive tackle Haloti Ngata said he tried to be a dispassionate observer of the divisional playoff game between the New England Patriots and the Houston Texans. As he watched the game on television, Ngata studied both offenses, at least until the third quarter, when it became clear that the Patriots were well on their way to securing a rematch with the Ravens in Sunday’s A.F.C. Championship game.At that point, Ngata allowed himself to feel some emotion.“I think we personally wanted to play the Patriots again,” he said Monday at the Ravens’ training site. “If we were to go to the Super Bowl, it would be great to go through Foxborough and win there.”The two teams are familiar dance partners in the N.F.L. playoffs, and their postseason tangle last January — a 23-20 Patriots victory at Gillette Stadium — has served as fuel for the Ravens ever since. Baltimore had its opportunities in that game, so many opportunities. There was wide receiver Lee Evans, his go-ahead touchdown reception stripped by a Patriots defender with 23 seconds remaining. And there was kicker Billy Cundiff, his chance to send the game to overtime evaporating when his 32-yard field-goal attempt veered wide left.Neither player stuck with the team over the off-season, though the bad feelings — all the would-haves, could-haves, should-haves — have lingered. Offensive lineman Marshal Yanda said it took him two months to get over the loss. Ngata said he could still remember what it felt like in the locker room, the quiet despair.“It’s been a long road getting back to this point,” tight end Dennis Pitta said. “The way we left it last year didn’t sit well with us.”Ravens linebacker Brendon Ayanbadejo added some heat to the inevitable pregame buildup when he shared a few observations on Twitter late Sunday. “New England does some suspect stuff on offense,” Ayanbadejo wrote. “Can’t really respect it.” He also called the Patriots’ hurry-up offense a “gimmick.” On Monday, Ayanbadejo apologized for his comments, also via Twitter. He was not made available to the news media.The Ravens immediately sought to distance themselves from Ayanbadejo’s comments, treating the issue like a hazmat disaster. Coach John Harbaugh dismissed it as “not relevant” and “not worthy of a conversation.” Ngata also declined to weigh in. “That’s all about him and his deal,” he said of Ayanbadejo.If nothing else, the Ravens have shown an uncanny ability to overcome challenges. The word “resilience” has become an unofficial slogan. In reaching the rarefied air of the conference championship round, the Ravens did not always play the most aesthetically pleasing brand of football — or even win all that consistently. Pitta referred to the team’s late-season, three-game losing streak, “when nobody thought we would win another game.” It was a stretch of futility that cost the offensive coordinator Cam Cameron his job, so unsettled was the Ravens’ state of affairs.Yet the team somehow managed to reassemble enough confidence when it mattered most. After defeating the Indianapolis Colts in the wild-card round, the Ravens went to Denver for Saturday’s divisional playoff round and proceeded to stage one of the most dramatic upsets in franchise history. Their 38-35 double-overtime victory over the Broncos assured Harbaugh of his third trip to the A.F.C. Championship game in five seasons as the team’s coach.It took some magic. Joe Flacco threw a 70-yard touchdown pass to Jacoby Jones with 31 seconds remaining to force overtime, and the rookie kicker Justin Tucker — Cundiff’s replacement — made a game-winning 47-yard field goal to cap the fourth-longest game in N.F.L. history. “I’ve never been nervous about Justin Tucker kicking a field goal,” Ngata said.The game was a test of endurance amplified by the fact that it was played at altitude, in the thin air of Denver and in bone-numbing cold. Ngata said he expected the Ravens to benefit from an extra day of rest before facing the Patriots.Still, the Ravens are not traveling the most forgiving route to a potential Super Bowl berth. One week after dismissing the Broncos’ Peyton Manning, Baltimore will be forced to deal with Tom Brady — two generation-defining quarterbacks, back to back. So Ngata could be forgiven for misspeaking Monday when he said the Ravens must “put some pressure on Peyton — uh, Brady.”In Week 3, the Patriots traveled to Baltimore, blew a 9-point fourth-quarter lead and lost, 31-30, as Flacco threw for 382 yards. Harbaugh said he was not putting a lot of stock in that result. Too much has happened in the interim.“Heck of a challenge,” Harbaugh said, adding: “This is a team that changes a lot. They’re kind of like a chameleon.”Given all that has happened in recent weeks, Harbaugh was asked if he thought the Ravens were a team of destiny. Did he believe in such talk?“Our destiny right now is to go to Foxborough,” he said. “That’s the destiny that we’ve earned.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/nyregion/new-restrictions-imposed-on-mostafa-kamel-mostafa-lawyers-say.html,"Lawyers for a disabled Islamic preacher jailed in Manhattan said on Monday that the Federal Bureau of Prisons had recently imposed harsh new restrictions on their client, which have made it harder for him to prepare for his trial.The preacher, Mostafa Kamel Mostafa, 54, has been held in a highly secure wing of the Metropolitan Correctional Center since his extradition from Britain in October. He has pleaded not guilty to charges that he conspired in a 1998 kidnapping of tourists in Yemen and in an attempt to establish a terrorist training camp in Oregon.His lawyers, speaking at a hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan and in interviews afterward, said that about two weeks ago, jail officials imposed special administrative measures, known as SAMs, on Mr. Mostafa.Such measures, which severely restrict an inmate’s communications with outsiders other than lawyers or immediate family members, are used when a finding is made that there is “a substantial risk” that an inmate’s communications “could result in death or serious bodily injury” to others, officials say.The measures may also limit what Mr. Mostafa may read or his access to a computer, the lawyers said. They contended that no incident had warranted such restrictions on their client, who is also severely disabled, having lost the lower portions of both arms in explosions years ago.One lawyer, Joshua L. Dratel, said after the hearing that the measures were arbitrary, “an excuse for whatever” the jail “doesn’t want to provide” to Mr. Mostafa on any particular day.The lawyers also noted that their client, who is also known as Abu Hamza al-Masri, had not yet been provided with a new prosthetic device that he was to have been fitted with, complicating his ability to care for himself in prison. Mr. Mostafa has long worn a hook as a prosthetic device, which officials have said he may use while in his cell.The Bureau of Prisons said it would not comment on an inmate’s specific conditions of confinement. As for Mr. Mostafa’s prostheses, a spokesman reiterated an earlier statement, saying that the agency “makes every reasonable accommodation that is consistent with safety and security,” and that the process of “acquiring new prosthetics in this case continues.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/technology/worry-over-sales-spurs-talk-of-cheaper-iphones.html,"By now, most of the world knows what an iPhone is — and they know it typically doesn’t come cheap.That is the problem Apple faces. Analysts say it must decide whether to keep catering to the high end of the phone market, reaping fat profits from relatively fewer sales, or offer something cheaper to compete with lower-cost alternatives like Samsung’s phones.Worries about low-cost competition weighed on Apple’s stock on Monday after reports that the company had reduced orders of screens for the iPhone 5, suggesting that demand for the phone could be weaker than expected. The company’s shares dropped 3.6 percent for the day to close at $501.75; they have slid 29 percent from their high in September.The long slump in the stock price has increased the pressure on the company to produce a solid earnings report Jan. 23, when investors will be looking closely to see how strong iPhone sales were.The iPhone is still a top seller in the American market. But it has a tougher time competing in other markets, where consumers buy phones without a subsidy from a wireless carrier. In countries like Brazil, Germany and Spain, the iPhone 5 can cost $650.And even the cheaper iPhones, like the 4 and 4S, are more expensive than the cheapest Android phones, said Tero Kuittinen, an independent mobile analyst and vice president of Alekstra, a company that helps people manage their cellphone bills.“The people buying their first smartphones now are lower-income households,” Mr. Kuittinen said. “They don’t have enough money to have $650 to pay for a smartphone.”Analysts say that in the earnings report, they will pay special attention to the average selling price of iPhones to determine whether the iPhone 5 is still the hot seller or whether cheaper models are making up a majority of sales. The trend might help determine whether Apple will eventually introduce a new lower-end iPhone.Apple does appear to be cutting back on orders for its latest iPhone from its manufacturing partners, as Nikkei of Japan and The Wall Street Journal reported earlier. Paul Semenza, an analyst at NPD DisplaySearch, a research firm that follows the display market, said that for January, Apple had expected to order 19 million displays for the iPhone 5 but cut the order to 11 million to 14 million. Mr. Semenza said these numbers came from sources in the supply chain, the companies that make components for Apple products.The reduction in orders for screens could be related to excess inventory, or because consumer demand for the iPhone 5 just was not as strong as Apple had predicted, Mr. Semenza said. “Certainly, demand from Apple to the display makers seems to have been corrected pretty significantly,” he said.Natalie Kerris, an Apple spokeswoman, declined to comment.Laurence I. Balter, an analyst at Oracle Investment Research, said one reason Apple’s stock had been hurting was that analysts often overshoot with their predictions for how many devices Apple will sell each quarter. He said that might explain some of Monday’s sharp drop: “Everybody got a little too aggressive and optimistic.”Mr. Balter said there was plenty of room left for Apple to grow and China was a particularly important market. The iPhone is available there for China Unicom, a major wireless network. But Apple has yet to strike a deal with China’s bigger cellphone carrier, China Mobile, which has a whopping 600 million subscribers — about six times as many as AT&T. That is Apple’s opportunity for huge growth, Mr. Balter said.“In China, the Apple brand on the iPhone is a status symbol,” he said. “You’re going to have the Samsung device, which is a nice phone, or you’ll show your friends you have an Apple device. It’s like wearing a pair of Levi’s versus a Costco brand.”Mr. Balter said he thought Apple’s strategy for growth would be to go after more price-conscious consumers, because once they become customers, they are likely to keep buying other Apple products. Perhaps the key to that strategy will be a cheaper iPhone, he said.But even if Apple were to offer a cheaper iPhone, it is unlikely it would be dirt cheap, Mr. Kuittinen said. If it chose to play more aggressively in foreign markets, Apple would more likely introduce a midprice model that is cheaper than the newest iPhone but more expensive than the cheapest phones on the market, he said. That would be similar to its approach with the iPad Mini, which is more expensive than the smaller tablets sold by Google and Amazon but much cheaper than the full-size iPad."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/global/eu-officials-impatient-over-lack-of-progress-on-trade-pact-with-us.html,"FRANKFURT — American and European officials are taking longer than expected to agree to begin free-trade talks, leading to some barely contained impatience among European political leaders who are hoping that President Barack Obama will signal support for a pact in his State of the Union address next month.A joint statement by top U.S. and European trade officials was expected by the end of December or the beginning of this month, clearing the way for formal talks aimed at removing tariffs between the United States and the European Union, which are each other’s largest trading partners by far.The continued absence of the statement, with no clear indication when it might come, has led to some frustration among European leaders, as well as among U.S. and European business groups who say that an accord could spur growth and job creation on both sides of the Atlantic.“One is a bit impatient,” said Peter Beyer, a member of the German Parliament who has been involved in efforts to push trade talks forward. Mr. Beyer belongs to the center-right party led by Chancellor Angela Merkel, who like most euro zone leaders has expressed strong support for a trade accord.Mr. Beyer and others involved in the issue said that they were not aware of any problem with the substance of a deal, and that they assumed the delay was a result of changes in the White House as Mr. Obama prepared to begin his second term.“It has a lot to do with Obama building a new administration,” Mr. Beyer said.There is considerable commerce at stake. Imports and exports between the United States and the European Union totaled $594 billion in the first 11 months of 2012. There is broad agreement in government and industry that both regions would benefit by eliminating tariffs and harmonizing regulations that apply to a broad range of products that include drugs, auto parts and even toys.Among the groups filing statements last year in support of an agreement was the Spanish Toy Association, which complained that products approved for safety in Europe must be recertified in the United States and vice versa, adding unnecessary costs.U.S. business groups have also been pushing energetically for talks to begin, arguing that the economic impact could be substantial because the overall volume of trade is so large.“This is an important opportunity for both sides to get their economies going again, and we hope there will be positive recommendation by the end of the month,” said Peter H. Chase, vice president for Europe at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Brussels.While some food producers and other industry groups have expressed concerns about what the provisions of a deal might be, there does not seem to be any broad-based opposition. But because the United States and European Union are both so large, reaching an agreement will be extremely complex.Andrea Mead, a spokeswoman for the U.S. trade representative in Washington, was unable to provide much detail on progress on a free-trade agreement.“We know there is a lot of interest in whether we will decide with our E.U. colleagues to launch F.T.A. negotiations,” she said Monday. “Our work in that regard is ongoing. We want to take the time to get the substance right so that any agreement we might pursue would maximize job-supporting economic opportunities.”The most optimistic estimates are that an accord could be reached by the end of the year, but it could take longer.A so-called High Level Working Group, made up of top trade officials from the United States and the European Union, was originally supposed to issue a statement in November that would establish a broad framework for detailed negotiations.That deadline was then delayed until December or early January. There is still no firm indication when it might come.Proponents of a deal would be delighted if Mr. Obama were to make even a glancing reference to an agreement when he makes his State of the Union address on Feb. 12.The president’s endorsement would send a signal of encouragement to the hundreds of midlevel officials who would have to do the mind-numbing work involved in formulating an accord.“That would be very positive,” said Mr. Beyer, the member of the German Parliament. “I don’t know how realistic that is.”The United States and Europe have been discussing a trade pact informally since the 1990s. But despite widespread agreement that a comprehensive pact would be good for both economies, progress has been achingly slow.Governments may have been put off by the complexity of the negotiations that would be needed, and they were also preoccupied with opening up new markets in Asia and other fast-growing regions.In addition, because the United States and European Union are each accustomed to being the dominant power in trade talks, it will take some adjusting to negotiate with a trade partner on roughly equal terms.Still, with Europe struggling to emerge from a recession, leaders including the British prime minister, David Cameron, have argued that a free-trade deal would be both a cheap and a relatively painless way to stimulate growth.Mr. Cameron said this month that reaching an agreement would be his priority as Britain takes over the rotating leadership of the G-8 group of wealthy nations.Another impetus will come from Ireland, which this month assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union. Ireland is the only member of the euro zone where English is an official language, making it a favored gateway for U.S. companies and giving Ireland an especially keen stake in smoother trade relations.U.S. companies that maintain headquarters or very large operations in Ireland include Dell, Google, Microsoft and Pfizer.Richard Bruton, the Irish minister for jobs, enterprise and innovation, said in a statement that a trade deal could lift the E.U. economy by €120 billion, or $160 billion, per year and the U.S. economy by $100 billion.“Gains of that scale are invaluable at a time like this,” he said.Brian Knowlton contributed reporting from Washington."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq composite index ended lower on Monday as worries over demand for Apple products drove down its shares and investors braced for earnings disappointments.Running counter to that was Dell’s stock, which rose 13 percent to about a five-month high at $12.29 after Bloomberg News reported that the No. 3 personal computer maker was in talks with private equity firms to go private. Dell’s gains offset some weakness in the technology sector.Apple lost 3.6 percent to $501.75 and was the biggest weight on both the S.& P. 500 and Nasdaq 100 indexes after reports emerged that the company had cut orders for LCD screens and other parts for the iPhone 5 this quarter because of weak demand. The stock hit a session low of $498.51, the first dip below $500 since Feb. 16.“With Apple, it seems as if the sentiment has shifted from this being the one stock that everybody wanted to own” to people starting to see it as a company whose business is “slowing down somewhat,” said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer of North Star Investment Management in Chicago.Adding to investor unease, fourth-quarter earnings kick into high gear this week. Analyst estimates for the quarter have fallen sharply since October. S.& P. 500 earnings growth is now seen up just 1.9 percent from a year ago, Thomson Reuters data showed.The Dow Jones industrial average was up 18.89 points, or 0.14 percent, at 13,507.32. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was down 1.37 points, or 0.09 percent, at 1,470.68. The Nasdaq composite index was down 8.13 points, or 0.26 percent, at 3,117.50.Apple suppliers also lost ground, with Cirrus Logic off 9.4 percent at $28.62 and Qualcomm down 1 percent at $64.24.The Dow fared better than the other two indexes, helped in part by Hewlett-Packard shares, which rose 4.9 percent to $16.95. The stock, up early in the session after JPMorgan upgraded its rating on the shares and raised its price target to $21 from $15, added to gains after the Dell report.Tech has “become the arena for private equity or other capital-restructuring type of maneuvers because of the way their valuations and their balance sheets are,” Mr. Kuby said.An appliance and electronics retailer, Hhgregg, slumped 5.7 percent to $7.44 after the company cut its same-store sales forecast for the full year.Earnings reports are due this week from Goldman Sachs, Bank of America, Intel and General Electric, among other companies. Third-quarter reports ended with a gain of just 0.1 percent, the worst for an S.& P. 500 profit period in three years, according to Thomson Reuters data.President Obama warned Congress at a news conference on Monday that a refusal to raise the nation’s debt ceiling next month could mean a government shutdown and set off economic chaos.S.& P. futures had little reaction to comments after the bell by the Federal Reserve chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, who urged lawmakers to lift the country’s borrowing limit to avoid a debt default.Interest rates were lower. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 5/32, to 98, and the yield fell to 1.85 percent, from 1.87 percent late Friday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/realestate/commercial/amazon-drives-upsurge-in-seattle-office-market-activity.html,"If the strength of Seattle’s office market could be chalked up to one company, it would be Amazon.Last year, the online retailer was responsible for the city’s biggest deal, its largest lease and the purchase of the only large chunk of downtown land to come on the market in decades. Amazon bought its 1.8-million-square-foot headquarters last month from Vulcan Real Estate for $1.16 billion, the biggest office sale nationwide and a bold departure for a company that had been content to rent space until last year.And it’s not done yet. Although Amazon leases or owns 2.7 million square feet of space in Seattle, the online retailer plans to more than double that figure when it breaks ground on three office towers of its own on the northern fringe of downtown this year. Amazon did not return calls seeking comment.Amazon’s flurry of activity has led to rent increases and a drop in office vacancy and has inspired confidence in the market. Other companies, largely led by technology firms, have shaved the vacancy rate to 10.7 percent at the end of last year, from 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews, a commercial real estate brokerage.The biggest vacancy decrease has been in South Lake Union, an area north of downtown where Amazon’s stake in the neighborhood has drawn other companies looking for large floorplates and new buildings. In the last three years, about half of Seattle’s net absorption, or the amount of space companies leased and occupied, was in South Lake Union, where the vacancy rate fell to 5.4 percent from 9.3 percent, according to CBRE, a commercial real estate brokerage.“We’re seeing a lot of companies that want to be closer to Amazon and that synergy, whether they do business with Amazon or not,” said Jesse Ottele, a senior vice president at CBRE in Seattle.A tighter office market has pushed up rents across the city. The average rent rose to $29.19 a square foot at the end of last year, from $27.80 in the fourth quarter of 2011, according to Kidder Mathews. With few large blocks of Class A office space available and little new space expected to reach the market soon, brokers expect rents to go even higher this year.Developers are now talking about building again — even without a tenant. Eight million square feet of office space are in the works across the city, with more than half planned or under construction in South Lake Union, according to CBRE. Residential developers will also open 5,800 units this year, the most in decades, according to Dupre & Scott Apartment Advisors, a research firm.Vulcan Real Estate is betting more companies will want to move to South Lake Union. Although the developer, which owns 30 percent of the land there, has built more than five million square feet of space in the last decade, it has up to seven million square feet of space left that it can build. This year, Vulcan is breaking ground on two office buildings leased to Amazon and a life-sciences research building. If the City Council raises height limits in the neighborhood this spring, Vulcan may move ahead with plans for two more office buildings and three 24-story residential towers.“We’re now looking to position ourselves for a recovering economy and teeing up speculative buildings,” said Ada Healey, a vice president at Vulcan Real Estate. “We want to be in a situation to take advantage of 2013.”Other developers are also moving ahead in anticipation of the height rezoning. After purchasing blocks in South Lake Union in the last year and a half, Touchstone  and Skanska, a Swedish development and construction company, submitted permits for three office buildings, for a total of 1.1 million square feet, that would exceed current limits. Company executives said they would consider building without a signed tenant.“Sometime around mid-2012, we saw rents for Class A office that justified new construction,” said Lisa Picard, executive vice president of Skanska USA Commercial Development in Seattle. “The project is ready to start. We’ll look at the supply and demand of the market and decide whether to go.”Seattle appears to be at the top of many investors’ shopping lists. The Urban Land Institute ranked the city as fourth-best in the country for office buildings thanks to its projected job growth of 1.2 percent and its roster of expanding brand-name companies like Starbucks, Nordstrom and Boeing. Real estate investors, who are looking for steady returns, have flocked to Seattle for its stable and growing companies.“The capital followed the fundamentals,” said Kevin Shannon, CBRE’s vice chairman in Los Angeles. “Seattle and San Francisco were the two stars in West Coast markets. A couple of years ago, I’m not sure Seattle would be on a core shopping list. We now have a lot of people looking at Seattle.”The city’s investment market cemented its revival last year. The volume of deals skyrocketed 203 percent in 2012 over the previous year, to $5 billion, according to Real Capital Analytics, a research and consulting firm. Among the 14.5 million square feet sold, Amazon’s headquarters space is the largest.The sale of the Russell Investments Center building early last year, though, was perhaps the most significant of the year because it showed the city’s investment market had fully recovered. When the 42-story office tower was put up for sale in late 2011, it attracted 34 buyer tours, an “incredible” number, said Mr. Shannon of CBRE, which handled the sale. It sold last spring for $480 million — more than four times its purchase price in 2009.After its bid for the Russell building lost, Clarion Partners, an investment management company, looked for other buildings with the same “blue chip roster” and reliable rents, which it found at 1201 Third Avenue, the city’s second-tallest tower and a former headquarters of the failed Washington Mutual. Clarion advised on a deal to sell the 55-story tower for $548.8 million, the 10th-largest deal in the country last year, to a joint venture of MetLife and an unidentified institutional real estate investor.“We expect it to continue to have blue chip tenancy and generate good, predictable cash flow,” said Steve Latimer, a managing director at Clarion Partners. “We’re not expecting spectacular headlines of tripling our money in three years, just steady growth.”Seattle’s brisk sales pace may slow this year since so many office buildings have traded hands and there are few left.“Were there other first-class properties, we’d be interested,” said Mr. Latimer, Clarion’s Seattle director. “Seattle is clearly a market that will continue to grow.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/economy/retail-sales-improve-producer-prices-fall.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Retail sales rose more than expected in December, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, as Americans shrugged off the threat of higher taxes and bought automobiles and a variety of other goods.The government said retail sales rose 0.5 percent last month, compared with a 0.4 percent increase, after revisions, in November. Sales in November were previously reported to have gained 0.3 percent.Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise only 0.2 percent. Sales were up 4.7 percent from December 2011 and up 5.2 percent for the whole of 2012, suggesting momentum in consumer spending as the year ended.So-called core sales, which excludes automobiles, gasoline and building materials and corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, increased 0.6 percent after gaining 0.5 percent in November.The second consecutive month of gains in core sales suggested that consumer spending picked up in the fourth quarter after rising at an annual pace of 1.6 percent in the July-through-September period.The government also said on Tuesday that producer prices fell in December for the third consecutive month as food prices declined by the most in a year and a half.The Labor Department said its seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index slipped 0.2 percent last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices at farms, factories and refineries to drop 0.1 percent.A 0.9 percent drop in food costs drove most of the December decline. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, wholesale prices rose 0.1 percent, which was in line with analysts’ forecasts.The core reading suggested that businesses were seeing little growth in price pressures. It could reinforce the outlook that modest inflation would give the Federal Reserve space to continue with easy-money policies aimed at propping up the economy.The decline in overall prices brought 12-month inflation to 1.3 percent.The Commerce Department also said business inventories rose modestly in November as sales increased solidly, indicating that a buildup in inventories would not add much to economic growth in the fourth quarter.Inventories increased 0.3 percent, to a record $1.62 trillion, after rising by the same margin in October.The gain in November was in line with economists’ expectations. Automobile inventories rose 0.5 percent after increasing 0.8 percent in October."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/opinion/wal-mart-offers-jobs-to-veterans.html,"Wal-Mart, the nation’s largest private employer, says it plans to offer jobs to any recent veterans who want one and hire more than 100,000 of them in the next five years. Other companies should follow Wal-Mart’s lead in this welcome effort to help reduce high unemployment among those who served in recent wars.Government statistics show that the unemployment rate for veterans was 10.8 percent in December. That is down from 13.1 percent a year earlier, but it is still far higher than the 7.5 percent jobless rate for nonveterans.Michelle Obama and Jill Biden have led an admirable program called Joining Forces to help connect veterans with jobs and other resources. Congress also allows businesses to claim a tax credit of up to $9,600 per qualified veteran they hire. But much more can be done, which is where initiatives like Wal-Mart’s come in.The company, which employs about 1.4 million people in the United States, says that it already employs about 100,000 veterans and finds that they are “quick learners” and “team players.” It’s no surprise that a company like Wal-Mart sees veterans as valuable given its need for large numbers of able workers. Some skeptics point out that Wal-Mart’s effort is a public-relations campaign to draw attention away from a bribery scandal in its Mexican operation and an active lawsuit by female employees who claim the company discriminated against them. But a pledge to hire veterans does not reduce the company’s responsibility to get to the bottom of the corruption allegations and ensure fairness for its workers.A Congressional report last year found that many veterans are jobless because their previous work experience was often in construction and manufacturing, which had big job losses during the recession. Another factor is that nearly one-third of recent veterans work in the public sector, presumably because government agencies are more willing to give them a chance. But government employment has fallen by more than 600,000 jobs in the last four years. That is why it is important that companies in other industries, including retailing, step in to hire veterans who have skills that could be adapted to many kinds of work."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/walmart-to-offer-more-us-made-goods.html,"The manufacturer 1888 Mills produces most of its sheets and towels overseas, in part to keep costs low for retailers like Walmart. But after Walmart gave 1888 Mills a long-term contract for towels made in the United States, 1888’s chief executive said the company expected to produce more goods here.A wide range of companies, including Apple, General Electric and Brooks Brothers, are experimenting with making more products in the United States. The moves make good public relations, but they also take advantage of cheaper energy costs and transportation benefits in this country.On Tuesday, Walmart, the nation’s largest retailer, gave its suppliers an added incentive, announcing that it would increase sourcing of American-made products by $50 billion over the next 10 years. Walmart said it would buy more goods already produced in the United States, like games and paper, as well as help vendors in areas like furniture and textiles return production that had moved overseas.The company did not disclose the value of the American-made products it already sourced. In its most recent fiscal year, Walmart spent $335 billion buying and transporting merchandise globally. (It does not break out figures for the United States and Sam’s Club, which represent about 70 percent of over all sales.) The $50 billion commitment — $5 billion a year — represents about 1.5 percent of that annual total.With rising labor and energy costs overseas, “a few manufacturers have even told Walmart privately that they have defined the ‘tipping points’ at which manufacturing abroad will no longer make sense for them,” William S. Simon, the Wal-Mart U.S. chief executive, said in making the announcement at the National Retail Federation conference in New York.Walmart has been under pressure concerning its overseas sourcing because of a deadly fire in November in Bangladesh that killed more than 100 people at a factory used by Walmart suppliers. Walmart has said it did not know the suppliers were using the factory, and a Walmart spokesman, David Tovar, said on Tuesday that the company had been working on the new initiative to buy more American goods for more than a year.James Cerruti, a senior partner for strategy and research at the consulting firm Brandlogic, said that while Walmart no doubt wanted to get away from recent negative news like the factory fire, gun sales and a Mexico bribery inquiry, “these are real commitments.”One beneficiary of the new effort, 1888 Mills, said an advantage was Walmart’s committing to contracts longer than the standard six months to a year. Jonathan R. Simon, the 1888 chief executive, said Walmart had given the company a multiyear contract outlining how and when it would buy the American-made towels.That “allows us to make investments with confidence,” he said. “We’ve been staying with U.S. manufacturing and quite honestly, we’re one of the very last producers of terry towels left in the United States. It had been quite a challenge, keeping the operation going, but we stuck with it hoping that eventually there would be more opportunity.”Mr. Simon said 1888 Mills made about 10 percent of its products in the United States, including towels in Griffin, Ga. While 1888 Mills had been supplying Walmart with foreign-made products, the retailer recently agreed to carry an American-made towel at 600 of its stores starting this spring.Executives at Walmart told Mr. Simon that “especially in some of the towns where we manufacture that have been hit hard by the economic downturn, that these are Walmart customers and it makes perfect sense to try to support jobs here in the U.S. for people who end up shopping in their stores,” he said.In the last decade or so, American manufacturers have moved operations to China, Bangladesh, Vietnam and other lower-cost countries as they try to meet retailers’ strict cost requirements. However, recent consumer interest in American-made goods, rising labor and energy costs overseas, and pressure to get merchandise from the design phase into stores within weeks rather than months have renewed interest in manufacturing in this country.For instance, the United States turned out almost 100 million pairs of shoes in 2000, but that fell to about 26 million by 2009, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association. In 2011, though, there was a rebound to 30 million pairs.The association reported a similar trend in apparel, with about one-third of all apparel sold in the United States being produced in this country in 2000. By 2009 that amount had fallen to 2.1 percent, but ticked up to 2.3 percent in 2011.Bill Kilbride, the president of Mohawk Home, a Walmart supplier that produced rugs and mats in the United States, said that although American-made products often cost more, Walmart seemed to find the speed with which domestic manufacturers could make and get items into stores compelling.Even so, Kevin Burke, the chief executive of the American Apparel and Footwear Association, said the challenge for Walmart would be finding vendors who could meet its price points with American production, which was generally much more expensive than overseas production.“The trend has been to be offshore,” Mr. Burke said. Overseas production is “indicative of consumer demand for product at a lower price.”The 1888 Mills product made in the United States, for instance, would not be budget-priced, but would be “more in the luxury end of the business,” Mr. Simon, the 1888 Mills chief executive, said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/global-economy-is-looking-brighter-world-bank-says.html,"WASHINGTON — Some of the darkest clouds threatening the global economy have started to lift, according to the World Bank’s periodic update to its economic forecasts.The latest version of the twice-yearly Global Economic Prospects report is one of the development bank’s least pessimistic in recent years, but hardly an exercise in optimism. It describes a “dramatic” easing of financial conditions around the world, stemming in part from policy changes to soothe the bond markets in Europe. Still, it warns that global growth will continue to be sluggish for years to come.In the report, the World Bank estimates the world economy grew just 2.3 percent in 2012. It expects growth to pick up only modestly in the coming years, from 2.4 percent in 2013 to 3.3 percent in 2015.Developing countries were responsible for more than half of global growth in 2012, the report said, and they will continue to be an engine of growth. The report estimates that developing countries grew 5.1 percent in 2012, and that the pace of growth will accelerate to 5.8 percent in 2015.“Four years after the crisis, high-income countries are still struggling,” Andrew Burns, the report’s lead author, said in an interview. “Developing countries need to respond to that difficult environment not through fiscal and monetary stimulus, but rather by looking to reinforce their underlying growth potential in order to have sustainably stronger growth going forward.”For the last four years, developing countries have remained in something of a defensive crouch, World Bank experts said. Their central banks and finance ministries have intently focused on managing the volatile financial and economic conditions emanating from the United States and Europe, and their policy making has focused on the short term.But credit conditions have eased significantly in Europe, particularly since the European Central Bank, led by Mario Draghi, embarked on a major bond-buying program last year.Growth has started to pick up in the United States, after taking a hit in the second half of 2012 because of uncertainty stemming from the presidential election and the so-called fiscal cliff, a series of automatic spending cuts and tax increases that Congress mostly averted this month.Now, developing economies need to focus more on their domestic economic troubles, bank economists said. That might mean making long-term investments in infrastructure, education, public health or regulation, rather than focusing on short-term stimulus measures to counteract economic fluctuations from elsewhere around the globe.“They have spent the past four years reacting to what’s going on in high-income countries,” said Mr. Burns, noting that different developing countries faced significantly different development challenges. “As a result, almost necessarily, they’ve been paying less attention to some of these long-term growth-enhancing reforms that are so necessary.”The report says that significant downside risks to global growth persist, including stalled progress in solving the European debt crisis, fiscal uncertainty in the United States, a decline in investment in China and spiking oil prices. However, the report said, “the likelihood of these risks and their potential impacts has diminished, and the possibility of a stronger-than-anticipated recovery in high-income countries has increased.”Developing countries may start to reorient away from a crisis mind-set, the bank said.“The whole discussion has been dominated by the global crisis,” said Hans Timmer, the director of the development prospects group at the World Bank. “It’s logical that you are distracted, but there are several problems with that: If you don’t go back to the reform agenda, you don’t have that growth in the future.”Weakness in large, wealthy countries continues to weigh on growth in the developing world, the report notes, hitting big exporters in South Asia, for instance. Political turmoil continues to rack the Middle East and North Africa, it said. But economic activity in East Asia has rebounded because of increasing regional trade and domestic demand in China.In contrast, developed countries, like Germany, Japan and the United States, had growth of only 1.3 percent in 2012. The bank expects that growth to pick up starting in 2014, reaching 2.3 percent by 2015. The bank projects that the euro zone will continue to contract in 2013, reaching sluggish growth of 1.4 percent by 2015.Global trade in goods and services is a bright spot in the report. Over all, such trade grew just 3.5 percent in 2012. The bank expects trade to jump 6 percent in 2013 and 7 percent by 2015, in no small part because of accelerating demand from new consumers in big developing countries.“From hopes for a U-shaped recovery, through a W-shaped one, the prognosis for global growth is getting alphabetically challenged,” Kaushik Basu, the World Bank chief economist, said in a statement. “With governments in high-income countries struggling to make fiscal policies more sustainable, developing countries should resist trying to anticipate every fluctuation in developed countries and instead ensure that their fiscal and monetary polices are robust and responsive to domestic conditions.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/us/politics/record-taxpayer-cost-is-seen-for-crop-insurance.html,"WASHINGTON — The worst drought in 50 years could leave taxpayers with a record bill of nearly $16 billion in crop insurance costs because of poor yields.The staggering cost of the program has drawn renewed attention, as the Obama administration and Congressional Republicans wrangle over ways to cut the deficit. Last month, Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner said that reducing farm subsidies was one way that the administration could cut government spending. But Congress has resisted.The Agriculture Department, which runs the program, said that the total losses from crops harvested last year would not be known for weeks, but that costs from the program were estimated to be $15.8 billion, up from $9.4 billion in 2011.Separately, a record $11.4 billion in indemnities for crop losses has been paid out to farmers, and officials say that number could balloon to as much as $20 billion. In 2011, a then-record $10.8 billion was paid out in indemnities.The crop insurance program has drawn criticism from a wide range of groups, including the Environmental Working Group and the conservative Heritage Foundation, two Washington research groups, which say that the costs need to be reduced and that the program mainly benefits insurance companies and large farmers. Farmers’ net income for 2012 is expected to be $114 billion, down 3 percent from 2011 but still the second highest in 30 years.Thomas P. Zacharias, the president of National Crop Insurance Services, an industry trade group, defended the program, saying that the record crop losses last year showed the need for insurance.“This year, most farmers will be able to rebound from historic drought, thanks to crop insurance,” Mr. Zacharias said.The federal crop insurance program dates to the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s, when Congress created the taxpayer-subsidized insurance to protect farmers against crop losses. Today, the government pays about 62 percent of the insurance premiums. The policies are sold by 15 private insurance companies that receive about $1.3 billion annually from the government. The government also backs the companies against losses.Government documents show that taxpayers have paid nearly $7 billion so far to subsidize premiums for 2012. The documents also show that taxpayers could pay another $7 billion to underwrite losses by the insurance companies and other costs.“Essentially, taxpayers are hit twice by the cost of the program,” said Bruce A. Babcock, an agriculture economist at Iowa State University.President Obama has proposed cutting crop insurance subsidies and reducing the amount paid to insurance companies, saving $4 billion over 10 years.But Congress has balked at making such cuts, and has even proposed expanding the program. Last year, lawmakers on the House and Senate Agriculture Committees passed legislation that would eliminate $5 billion a year in direct payments to farmers and farmland owners who receive government checks regardless of whether they grow crops. But the legislation would use the savings to expand crop insurance.Crop insurance subsidies are set to cost more than $94 billion over the next 10 years.Steve Ellis, the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said farmers and insurance companies should assume more of the risks of farming.“Given the trillions of dollars of debt, the government could scale back the scope of the premiums subsidy and other costs,” he said. “We can have significant savings without changing the scope of the program.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/global/daily-euro-zone-watch.html,"BERLIN — Despite a drumbeat of optimistic forecasts from economists and upbeat statements from various European leaders, the actual news on the economy continues to be grim, with figures released Tuesday showing that Germany, the Continent’s flagship economy, contracted by about 0.5 percent in the final months of last year. Combined with a flurry of disappointing results recently in other major economies, the stumble raised questions about Europe’s ability to escape recession.Portugal’s central bank cut its economic forecast for the year on Tuesday, saying its economy will contract more steeply than expected. France said it was likely to miss its target for narrowing the budget deficit, raising the prospects of deeper spending cuts and additional taxes. Last month, Britain said its austerity budgets would extend three extra years, to 2018, because of weaker than expected growth.“This idea that Germany is a powerhouse dragging the rest of Europe along with it is a bit of a myth to be honest,” said Philip Whyte, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform in London. “You have a very weak periphery and a core which is not as strong as everyone seems to believe.”Throughout the debt crisis, Germany has managed to float above the bad news, enjoying record employment, rock-bottom borrowing costs and export-led growth that kept chugging, in spite of the cloud hanging over the euro zone. But its European partners are also among its biggest customers, leaving it vulnerable to the Continent-wide slowdown exacerbated by the very austerity policies of Chancellor Angela Merkel.“The longer the euro crisis lasts, the more difficult the situation becomes for Germany,” said Stefan Kooths, an economist at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy. “Germany is not a Teflon economy.”The German government is scheduled to release its report on the economy on Wednesday, and it will forecast growth in 2013 of 0.5 percent, the newspaper Handelsblatt reported. In the euro zone as a whole, which is in recession with record unemployment, any growth is considered positive. But most forecasts are based on the assumption that financial markets will remain calm. If anything shakes investor confidence, like political turmoil in Italy or Greece, the weak growth rate means Germany would not have much cushion against recession.France will probably miss its deficit reduction target for 2012, according to preliminary data released Tuesday by the French government. Officials in Paris aimed for a deficit of 4.5 percent of gross domestic product, but data for November suggests the shortfall will be 4.8 percent, ING Bank estimated.That means President François Hollande would have to find an additional $6.65 billion in revenue to meet the 2013 budget target, and France could face another credit rating downgrade. The data also shows the challenge of keeping France’s overall debt level from rising above its current level of more than 90 percent of G.D.P.By contrast, Germany’s public finances are robust. Federal, state and local governments recorded a surplus for the year equal to 0.1 percent of G.D.P., the first government surplus since 2007. That creates leeway for Ms. Merkel to stimulate the economy with public spending if the downturn is worse than expected.Despite the contraction in the fourth quarter, a compilation of annual economic data by the statistical office showed that the German economy is in fundamentally good shape. Exports rose 4.1 percent during the year, and 41.6 million people were employed — a record high and the sixth annual increase in a row.And Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, said in a note to clients that he expected the German economy to expand again in the first half of the year.Still, Mr. Whyte, of the Center for European Reform, said that while he was more optimistic than at this time last year, “we’re still not out of the woods.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"Wall Street edged higher on Tuesday after retail data came in stronger than projected, although the tech heavyweight Apple dragged on the market for a third day.Apple was the biggest weight on both the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index and the Nasdaq 100 after it was reported on Monday that Apple was cutting orders for iPhone parts. Apple shares declined 3.2 percent, to $485.92, and closed below $500 for the first time since last February.Retailers’ stocks advanced after the government reported that retail sales rose more than expected during December. Investors took this as a favorable sign for fourth-quarter growth. A separate report showed manufacturing activity in New York State declined in January, for the sixth straight month.“A little better than expected news on retail sales once again reinforces that the consumer remains alive and reasonably well,” said Mark D. Luschini, chief investment strategist at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, which manages about $54 billion in assets.Among retailers, shares of American Eagle Outfitters gained 4.8 percent, to $20.58, and Gap shares rose 3.4 percent, to $32.46. The Morgan Stanley retail index rose 1.5 percent.Shares of the apparel retailer Express surged 23.8 percent, to $17.40, after it raised its fourth-quarter and full-year 2012 outlook.The Dow Jones industrial average climbed 27.57 points, or 0.2 percent, to 13,534.89.

But at the end of the day, its influence, considering it’s still 3 1/2 to 4 percent of the S.& P. 500 index, is being felt,” Mr. Luschini said.He attributed the decline “to just some of the bloom coming off the rose.” He added, “They haven’t necessarily done anything wrong, as much as others have caught up.”Some investors are on edge over the looming debt ceiling debate. On Monday, President Obama rejected any negotiations with Republicans over raising the federal debt ceiling. The United States could default on its debt if Congress does not increase the borrowing limit.Resolving the debt ceiling is more a question of how than if. Investors do not expect the United States to default, but they are also wary of another 11th-hour agreement like the one in August 2011.A lackluster earnings season has also kept investors from aggressive bets. Analysts’ estimates for the quarter have fallen sharply since October. S.& P. 500 earnings growth is now projected to be up just 1.8 percent compared with a year ago, according to data from Thomson Reuters.The homebuilder Lennar reported a sharp rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday, but its stock slipped 0.8 percent, to $40.68, on worries that growth in orders was slowing.On the down side, shares of Facebook dropped 2.7 percent, to $30.10. The company unveiled a “graph search” feature that Mark Zuckerberg, the chief executive, said would help users sort information that people share.Interest rates were lower. The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 4/32, to 98 4/32, and the yield fell to 1.84 percent, from 1.85 percent late Monday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/aig-seeks-ability-to-sue-more-banks-over-mortgage-securities.html,"Since the summer of 2011, the insurance giant American International Group has been battling Bank of America over claims that the bank packaged and sold it defective mortgages that dealt A.I.G. billions of dollars in losses.Now A.I.G. wants to be able to sue other banks that sold it mortgage-backed securities that plunged in value during the financial crisis. It has not said which banks, but possibilities include Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase.But to sue, A.I.G. first must win a court fight with an entity controlled by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, which the insurer says is blocking its efforts to pursue the banks that caused it financial harm.The dispute illustrates the web of financial instruments that A.I.G. and the federal government became tangled in as the insurer nearly collapsed in 2008 and required a vast taxpayer bailout. It also shows the complexity of apportioning blame, five years after the financial crisis, and making wrongdoers pay for their share of the harm.According to a lawsuit filed Friday, A.I.G. is seeking a declaration from a New York state judge that it has the right to pursue “billions of dollars of fraud and other tort claims that exist against numerous financial institutions,” even though Fed officials have said A.I.G. gave up that right.“If I were the general counsel of A.I.G., I would seek this kind of declaratory judgment,” said Henry T. C. Hu, a former regulator who is now a professor at the University of Texas School of Law. “I don’t know whether I’d win, but it’s certainly worth trying.”Much of A.I.G.’s rescue was needed because it didn’t have money in 2008 to cover guarantees that it sold banks in case the complex securities in their portfolios defaulted. But the latest dispute centers on a less familiar part of the bailout — the part in which reserves were removed from A.I.G.’s life insurance units and replaced with what turned out to be troubled mortgage securities.The securitized housing loans lost value so fast when the bubble burst that some of A.I.G.’s life insurers risked being shut down by state insurance regulators. The Fed stepped in instead, and A.I.G.’s current lawsuit centers on the relationship that formed between the insurer and its rescuer as a result.The Fed paid about $44 billion to extricate A.I.G.’s life insurance units from soured trades, and set up a special entity, Maiden Lane II, to buy the plunging mortgage securities for $20.8 billion. Those securities had an original face value of $39.3 billion.Maiden Lane II is the sole defendant in A.I.G.’s lawsuit. The complaint says that at the moment Maiden Lane II bought the securities, it locked the insurance units into an $18 billion loss — the difference between the securities’ face value and their price in late 2008, arguably the bottom of the market. A.I.G. attributes a large chunk of its losses to the mortgage securities that it bought from Bank of America. It sued the bank for $10 billion in August 2011.But one of Bank of America’s defenses is that A.I.G. lacks standing, having given its litigation rights to Maiden Lane II.Last month, for instance, two senior Fed officials submitted declarations saying they believed that as part of the sale of assets to Maiden Lane II, A.I.G. had agreed not to go after any of the banks.That prompted A.I.G. to file its suit, arguing that when it sold the tainted assets to Maiden Lane II, it did yield some litigation rights, but not the ones giving it the right to bring fraud complaints against the banks that put the securities together.A.I.G. said those banks had misled its life insurance and money management businesses regarding the quality of the securities, and “obtained artificially high credit ratings” so the securities would pass the life insurers’ investment rules.A.I.G.’s lawsuit is separate from one that until late last week it considered joining, which argued that the New York Fed acted unconstitutionally during the bailout, harming the insurer’s shareholders.That lawsuit was filed in 2011 by Maurice R. Greenberg, a former chief executive of A.I.G. and a major shareholder. Mr. Greenberg had hoped the company would join the lawsuit, but the possibility that A.I.G. would sue its rescuer drew sharp criticism and A.I.G.’s board decided against it.The new suit isn’t seeking financial compensation from the Fed.The New York Fed, which has sole control of Maiden Lane II, declined to discuss the matter and has not yet responded to the complaint. A hearing on the arguments in the Bank of America case is scheduled for Jan. 29 in U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.A.I.G. did not name other banks it would take action against, but it bought mortgage-backed securities from banks that included Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs and Bear Stearns, which was acquired during the financial crisis by JPMorgan. Much of the securities were sold to A.I.G. by Lehman Brothers, which collapsed in September 2008.A.I.G. watchers are intrigued by the newest chapter of the story.“A.I.G. has a credible claim that they’re pursuing aggressively,” said Michael J. Aguirre, a San Diego lawyer who is representing a California couple who argue the Fed was bilked when it bailed out A.I.G. “The question now is how aggressive the Fed is going to be on pushing back.”“Is the government going to say, ‘We’re not pursuing these claims, but we’re not going to let anybody else pursue them either — we’re just going to let the banks walk away with fraud profits?’ ” he added.Although it received relatively little scrutiny, the life insurance part of A.I.G.’s bailout was costlier than the better-known part involving A.I.G.’s Financial Products unit, which sold the notorious guarantees, known as credit-default swaps.In 2011, A.I.G. tried to buy back the entire pool of mortgage securities from Maiden Lane II, but its offer, about $15 billion, was rejected.Subsequently other bidders acquired all the assets, and last February the New York Fed announced it had made a $2.8 billion profit on its roughly $20 billion investment in the rescue entity. Terms of the bailout called for it to give one-sixth of any profit to A.I.G.Maiden Lane II no longer holds any of the mortgage securities and is winding down its affairs."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/nyregion/house-passes-50-7-billion-in-hurricane-aid.html,"WASHINGTON — After fierce lobbying by political leaders in states across the Northeast, the House of Representatives on Tuesday night approved a long-awaited $50.7 billion emergency bill to provide help to victims of Hurricane Sandy.The aid package passed 241 to 180, with 49 Republicans joining 192 Democrats. The Senate is expected to pass the measure, and President Obama has expressed support for it.The $50.7 billion — along with a nearly $10 billion aid package that Congress approved earlier this month — seeks to provide for the huge needs that have arisen in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states since the hurricane struck in late October.The emergency aid measure would help homeowners whose homes have been damaged or destroyed, provide assistance to business owners who experienced losses as well as reinforce shorelines, repair subway and commuter rail systems, fix bridges and tunnels, and reimburse local governments for emergency expenditures.Though the package does not cover the entire $82 billion in damage identified by the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut, leaders from the storm-ravaged region expressed relief over the action in the Republican-controlled House, where storm aid had become ensnared in the larger debate over spending and deficits.Representative Peter T. King, a Republican from Long Island who helped press his party’s leadership into holding the vote, hailed the package’s passage as a victory for storm victims but expressed disappointment over the House’s failure to act earlier.“It is unfortunate that we had to fight so hard to be treated the same as every other state has been treated,” Mr. King said.Senator Charles E. Schumer, the New York Democrat who is part of the chamber’s leadership, said he would urge the Senate to approve the House bill even though he believed it fell short of what the Senate approved last year. “It is certainly close enough,” he said, comparing the bills.The developments in the House settle, at least for now, an issue that had become an embarrassment for the chamber’s Republican leadership and had pitted Northeastern Republicans eager to help their constituents against fiscal conservatives bent on taming the nation’s deficits.The vote was scheduled over a week ago by Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, after he came under intense criticism for concluding the business of the previous Congress without taking up a $60.4 billion hurricane-aid bill that the Senate had approved.His critics included influential Republicans in and out of Congress, including Mr. King and Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.In a statement, Mr. Christie joined with Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, both Democrats, to express gratitude to the Congress for providing the relief to hurricane victims.The $50.7 billion package was presented on the floor in a carefully structured legislative approach that reflected the political sensitivities surrounding the issue. House leaders first offered a $17 billion bill and then a $33.7 billion amendment that was written by New Jersey and New York Republicans. The approach allowed House conservatives to vote for some of the assistance while lowering the total cost. Most of the money, included in the amendment, ultimately needed Democratic votes to be added to the final package and then passed.In the debate leading up to passage of the aid package, Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, a Democrat from New York, argued that House should have acted sooner. “Residents have been suffering for two-and-a-half months,” she said. “We need the aid. We need it now.”As the debate unfolded through the afternoon and into the evening, lawmakers from the region found themselves on the defensive at times, forced to beat back a barrage of amendments that sought to cut items out of the overall package or that demanded cuts in other programs to pay for the package.The most controversial of the amendments was offered by a group of conservative lawmakers who sought to pay for the aid package with across-the-board spending cuts to various programs in the 2013 federal budget.Critics called the amendment a poison pill, given that it would almost certainly doom the overall package’s prospects of passage in the Senate, controlled by Democrats. But the amendment’s backers said it was merely meant to clamp down on runaway spending and deficits.“This amendment is not about offering a poison pill,” said Representative Mick Mulvaney, a Republican from South Carolina and the amendment’s author. “I want the money to go where it needs to go.”The amendment was defeated 258 to 162, with 70 Republicans joining 188 Democrats to beat it back."

The plane has been plagued by a series of problems this year, including a battery fire and fuel leaks. Boeing’s stock sank $2.60 to $74.34, a loss of 3 percent.The Dow lost 23.66 points to close at 13,511.23. Without Boeing’s drop, the Dow would have ended the day nearly flat.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index inched up 0.29 to 1,472.63. A gain for Apple helped pull the Nasdaq composite up 6.77 points to 3,117.54.Apple rose $20.17 to $506.09, ending a three-day slide. Apple, the world’s largest publicly traded company, closed below $500 on Tuesday for the first time in nearly a year. Concern that the popularity of its iPhone is waning has pushed Apple’s stock down 5 percent this month.Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan Chase, the country’s largest bank, rose after both posted quarterly results that trounced analysts’ estimates.Harry Clark, chairman of Clark Capital Management Group in Philadelphia, described JPMorgan’s numbers as staggering. The bank’s quarterly earnings jumped 55 percent and total revenue for the year hit $100 billion.“Their earnings are just ridiculously good,” Mr. Clark said. “It shows you that these giants can make money in any type of environment.”Slightly smaller financial firms, like Northern Trust and Bank of New York Mellon, reported weaker earnings and their stocks sank.JPMorgan Chase gained 47 cents to $46.82. Its results were offset by an internal review of a $6 billion trading loss on credit derivatives. JPMorgan’s board criticized executives for failing to keep it informed of potential problems and using unapproved models for measuring trading risks.Goldman Sachs gained $5.50 to $141.09, a 4 percent jump. Its profits nearly tripled in the fourth quarter of last year. Goldman’s bond underwriting business had its best year since the financial crisis, thanks to strong demand for fixed-income investments and companies lining up to borrow at historically cheap rates.Genworth Financial jumped 9 percent, the largest gain in the S.& P. 500. Genworth, a financial services company, laid out a plan to reorganize its business, including putting its mortgage unit under a new company. Genworth’s stock gained 72 cents to $8.85.Analysts forecast that companies in the S.& P. 500 will report a 3.2 percent increase in fourth-quarter earnings. Financial firms and consumer-discretionary companies are expected to post the biggest growth, according to S&P Capital IQ.The Labor Department said consumer prices were flat last month as gas prices sank. The December reading of the Consumer Price Index capped a year of tame inflation. Consumer prices increased just 1.7 percent in 2012, down from 3 percent in 2011.The report led traders to push up prices for Treasurys, knocking yields down. The 10-year Treasury note rose 5/32 to 98 9/32 and the yield slipped to 1.82 percent. The yield, used to set mortgages and a wide variety of other loans, ended Tuesday at 1.84 percent.Wendy’s rose 4 percent, or 18 cents, to $5.08. The hamburger chain, known for its Frosty shakes and square burgers, posted earnings that topped Wall Street’s estimates, even as a critical indicator of sales at North American restaurants dipped slightly.Chipotle Mexican Grill dropped 6 percent. The burrito chain warned that its quarterly earnings would fall short of previous forecasts because it underestimated the hit it would take from higher food costs. Chipotle’s stock lost $16.38 to $280.94."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/global/german-central-bank-to-repatriate-gold-reserves.html,"FRANKFURT — Nearly half of Germany’s gold reserves are held in a vault at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York — billions of dollars worth of postwar geopolitical history squirreled away for safe keeping below the streets of Lower Manhattan.Now the German central bank wants to make a big withdrawal — 300 tons in all.On Wednesday, the Bundesbank said that it would begin moving some of the reserves, the second-largest stock in the world after that of the United States. The goal is to house more than 50 percent of German gold in Bundesbank vaults in Frankfurt by 2020, up from a little less than a third today, the bank said.Citing security reasons, Carl-Ludwig Thiele, a member of the Bundesbank, declined to say how the transfer would be accomplished or to estimate the cost. But he said the Bundesbank had plenty of experience moving large sums of money.During the cold war, West Germany followed a policy of storing its gold as far west as possible in case of a Soviet invasion. While that worry is gone, there is still an argument for keeping some gold in financial centers like New York and London. It remains the one currency that is accepted everywhere. In the event of a currency crisis, the gold could be quickly deployed in financial markets to help restore confidence.The New York Fed stores the German gold without cost on the theory that the presence of foreign gold supports the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency. A spokesman for the New York Fed declined to comment.The Bundesbank announcement follows a public outcry last year after a clash in Parliament about whether all the bank’s gold was properly accounted for.For the great many Germans who still rue the day they had to trade their marks for euros, there has been at least one consolation. If the common currency did not work out, Germany still had huge reserves of the hardest currency of all: gold.Except, as many people learned for the first time last year, it did not — at least not in the country itself.More than two-thirds of Germany’s gold reserves, valued at 137 billion euros, or $183 billion, is abroad, stored in vaults in New York, Paris and London.The new policy will include the complete withdrawal of 374 tons of German gold stored at the Banque de France in Paris, about 11 percent of the total. Bundesbank officials were quick to note that the decision was not a reflection of French trustworthiness. Rather, because France and Germany now share the euro, there is no need for reserves as insurance against currency crises.“The gold in Paris is in the best of hands,” Mr. Thiele said on Wednesday. “We are thankful to the Bank of France for storing it.”Still, news of the planned transfer caused some clucking in financial circles after news leaked out on Tuesday. “Central banks don’t trust each other?” William H. Gross, a founder and managing director of the investment firm Pimco, asked on Twitter.Mr. Thiele denied there was any mistrust. “We have no doubts about the integrity of other central banks,” he said. “We’re not aware of any irregularities.”After World War II, vanquished Germany had no gold reserves. The Nazis had used most of it to finance the war, and much of what was left vanished mysteriously in the postwar chaos.But as its economy recovered and Germany became the export powerhouse it is today, the country accepted gold as well as dollars from the central banks of its trading partners to cover the financial imbalance created by German trade surpluses.German reserves peaked in 1968 at about 4,000 tons, several years before the collapse of the so-called Bretton Woods system of fixed international exchange rates, which was underpinned by gold reserves.The end of Bretton Woods in 1973 eliminated some, though not all, of gold’s importance as a universal currency. The total has fallen to about 3,400 tons after Germany transferred some of its treasure to international institutions in which it participates, including the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.Mr. Thiele acknowledged that Germans could get emotional about their gold, but he insisted that the Bundesbank made its decision to repatriate the treasure independently and not because of a public outcry last year after reports suggested the gold was not properly accounted for.The government auditing agency, the Bundesrechnungshof, called on Bundesbank officials in a report to Parliament to conduct an inventory of the thousands of bars of German gold that are stacked in foreign vaults.Mr. Thiele said that he and other Bundesbank officials personally visited the German gold abroad and that he was satisfied that it was all there.At a packed news conference, Bundesbank officials attended by armed security guards demonstrated on Wednesday how they tested the bars for quality and authenticity. No two bars have exactly the same weight and purity, so each must be assessed separately.Even after Germany completes the transfer at the end of 2020, half of its gold will remain abroad — about 37 percent in New York. The Bundesbank does not plan to move any gold out of the Bank of England, which will continue to store 13 percent of the total.The Bank of England charges about 550,000 euros a year for storage, Bundesbank officials said.Despite the public criticism, the Bundesbank has not let go of its gold easily. It has continually rejected periodic attempts by political leaders to convert the reserves to cash and has not sold any gold on world markets.The central bank has, however, sold some of its holding to the public — in the form of commemorative German marks."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/moodys-outlook-on-higher-education-turns-negative.html,"The credit reporting agency Moody’s said on Wednesday that it had revised its financial outlook for colleges and universities, giving a negative grade to the entire field.For the last two years, Moody’s Investors Service gave the nation’s most elite public and private colleges a stable forecast while assigning a negative outlook to the rest of higher education. (Moody’s assigned a negative outlook for the sector in 2009, but it upgraded the most elite ones to stable in 2011-2012.)On Wednesday, Moody’s explained the change by saying that even the best colleges and universities faced diminished prospects for revenue growth, given mounting public pressure to keep tuition down, a weak economy and the prospect that a penny-pinching Congress could cut financing for research grants and student aid.The report advocates “bolder actions by university leaders to reduce costs and increase operational efficiency.”“The sector will need to adjust to the prospect of muted revenue growth,” the report says. “Strong governance and management leadership will be needed by most universities as they navigate through this period of intensified change and challenge.”While Moody’s gave a negative outlook for the overall industry, most of the nation’s top colleges and universities still carry the top credit rankings.Nonetheless, the Moody’s report reflects a time of rapid and disruptive change in higher education. Before the financial crisis, colleges and universities routinely raised tuition and fees as administrators sought to burnish their reputations — and the school’s rankings — with new buildings and more student services.That golden era was upended by the financial crisis. As household income dropped and jobs became scarce for college graduates, families became increasingly vulnerable to college costs and the prospect of students taking on onerous debt. At the same time, institutions could no longer count on an annual windfall from endowment returns, alumni gifts and state financing. All shriveled as the economy soured, and they have not fully recovered.In the 2011-2012 academic year, for instance, American families spent, on average, 5 percent less on higher education than in the previous year, Moody’s said. As a result, 25 percent of the private colleges that Moody’s rated did not raise tuition in fiscal 2011 at or beyond the rate of inflation; 21 percent of rated public universities did not do so.Students have become more dependent on federal grants and loans since the financial crisis. Any curtailment of federal aid could put further budget pressures on schools. Pell Grants for low-income students provided $36.5 billion to colleges and universities in fiscal 2011. That represented a median 21 percent of net tuition revenue for regional public universities.The rapid emergence of online learning provides both opportunities and challenges for higher education, Moody’s said. While online classes could threaten to undermine the residential college model, they could also provide new ways to make money and provide schools with broader audiences.Moody’s said the average debt burden for full-time students grew 55 percent in the 10 years that ended in 2012. But it maintained that the average debt load was manageable for most students, since 72 percent of student loans were held by borrowers with less than $25,000 in debt. Nonetheless, the report noted that the increasing focus on student debt and college affordability by the media and politicians puts additional pressure on college administrators to rein in costs.“Until universities demonstrate better ability to lower their cost of operations, perhaps through more intensive use of online classes and elimination or reduction of tenure, we expect government officials to produce bolder solutions in response to the public outcry against the cost of higher education,” the report said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/global/investment-into-china-declined-during-2012.html,"BEIJING — China’s foreign investment inflows fell last year for the first time since the global financial crisis, government data showed Wednesday, slipping 4 percent as a troubled world economy reduced investors’ enthusiasm for deals in emerging markets.But the nation, with the world’s second-largest economy, after that of the United States, still drew $111.7 billion in foreign direct investment in 2012 after a record $116 billion in 2011 and maintaining the country as one of the top destinations for corporate expansion.Foreign investment is an important gauge of the health of the global economy and of demand for the output of China’s huge manufacturing sector — though such investment is a small contributor to China’s overall capital flows when compared with exports, which were worth about $2 trillion in 2012.Analysts said cooling growth in China’s foreign direct investment, or F.D.I., did not suggest that investors’ confidence in the country was waning. Rather, it shows China needs another catalyst to drive inflows after the increase from joining the World Trade Organization hit a natural plateau.“We will see F.D.I. bouncing around $110 billion to $120 billion for some years,” said Tim Condon, an economist with ING in Singapore. “Hopefully, the current administration is going to intensify reform efforts, such as opening of the capital account. That could be momentous, in terms of attracting more F.D.I.”A new government led by Xi Jinping, the incoming president, is set to take over in March, and investors are hoping that Beijing will pursue changes it had delayed, including the relaxing of capital account controls, to drive China into the next stage of growth.Analysts forecast that data to be released on Friday would show China’s annual economic growth had rebounded to 7.8 percent in the fourth quarter of 2012 from 7.4 percent in the third — the weakest pace of expansion since the depths of the financial crisis in early 2009.In December, F.D.I. in China fell 4.5 percent from a year earlier to $11.7 billion, the Commerce Ministry said at a briefing Wednesday.China joined the W.T.O. in 2001, and foreign direct investment inflows have more than doubled since. Figures from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development show China now takes turns with the United States as the world’s top F.D.I. destination, with the United States pulling ahead of China by a slim margin in 2011.Shen Danyang, a spokesman from the Commerce Ministry, acknowledged that China had to try harder to attract foreign investors, without elaborating. But he stressed that foreign funds were not leaving in a big way.“It is true that some manufacturing companies are moving out of China,” Mr. Shen said. “But one point I want to remind you is that, so far, there is no big-scale pullout of foreign investment.”Data showed European and Asian firms had cut their Chinese investment the most, even though Asian firms remained by far the biggest foreign investors in China.Inflows from the European Union dropped 3.8 percent in 2012 from a year earlier to $6.1 billion, while F.D.I. from the top 10 Asian economies — including Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore — fell 4.8 percent last year to $95.7 billion.That contrasted with investment from the United States, which rose 4.5 percent on the year to $3.1 billion."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/faa-orders-grounding-of-us-operated-boeing-787s.html,"The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday that it was grounding all Boeing 787s operated by United States carriers until it can determine what caused a new type of battery to catch fire on two planes in nine days.The decision follows incidents involving a plane parked in Boston and one in Japan that was forced to make an emergency landing on Wednesday morning after an alarm warning of smoke in the cockpit. The problems prompted All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines to voluntarily ground their 787s.The F.A.A.'s emergency directive, issued Wednesday night, initially applies to United Airlines, the only American carrier using the new plane so far, with six 787s.Other regulators around the globe followed suit on Thursday. In Japan the transport ministry issued a formal order to ground all 787s indefinitely, until concerns over the aircraft’s battery systems are resolved. In India, the aviation regulator grounded all six of the 787s operated by the state-owned carrier Air India.European safety regulators also will ground Dreamliners.Boeing, based in Chicago, has a lot riding on the 787, and its stock dropped nearly 3.4 percent on Wednesday to $74.34. The company has outlined ambitious plans to double its production rate to 10 planes a month by the end of 2013. It is also starting to build a stretch version and considering an even larger one after that.“We are confident the 787 is safe and we stand behind its overall integrity,” Jim McNerney, Boeing’s chief executive, said in a statement.The grounding — an unusual action for a new plane — focuses on one of the more risky design choices made by Boeing, namely to make extensive use of lithium-ion batteries aboard its airplanes for the first time.Until now, much of the attention on the 787 was focused on its lighter composite materials and more efficient engines, meant to usher in a new era of more fuel-efficient travel, particularly over long distances. The batteries are part of an electrical system that replaces many mechanical and hydraulic ones common in previous jets.The 787’s problems could jeopardize one of its major features, its ability to fly long distances at a cheaper cost. The plane is certified to fly 180 minutes from an airport. The government is unlikely to extend that to 330 minutes, as Boeing has promised, until all problems with the plane have been resolved.For Boeing, “it’s crucial to get it right,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va. “They’ve got a brief and closing window in which they can convince the public and their flying customers that this is not a problem child.”The 787 uses two identical lithium-ion batteries, each about one-and-a-half to twice the size of a car battery. One battery, in the rear electrical equipment bay near the wings, is used to start the auxiliary power unit, a small engine in the tail that is used most often to provide power for the plane while it is on the ground. The other battery, called the main battery, starts the pilot’s computer displays and serves as a backup for flight systems.The maker of the 787’s batteries, Japan’s GS Yuasa, has declined to comment on the problems so far.Boeing has defended the novel use of the batteries and said it had put in place a series of systems meant to prevent overcharging and overheating.In a conference call last week with reporters, Boeing’s chief engineer for the 787, Mike Sinnett, said that the company had long been aware of possible problems with lithium-ion batteries, but it had built numerousredundant features to keep any problems with the batteries from threatening the plane in flight. He said the batteries had not had any problems in 1.3 million hours of flight, and that Boeing was trying to understand what had caused the problems.Mr. Sinnett said that if the lithium-ion batteries started a fire, it would be nearly impossible to put out because the batteries produce oxygen when burning. Mr. Sinnett said that the plane was designed to survive such an event in flight, when the cabin’s air-pressure system protects passengers and allows the plane to vent the smoke outside. The plane is also designed, he said, to contain a fire to a small area.“Fire suppressants just won’t work on a situation like that,” he said in the conference call. “So something like that is very difficult to put out.”Heat from the fire on the plane parked in Boston last week was so extreme that it melted the bolts holding the battery to the equipment rack. Firefighters had to use a hydraulic tool to cut it loose.The solutions to the battery problem could be simple, analysts said, like encasing the battery in a stronger shell or monitoring the batteries more closely. But if Boeing had to switch to more conventional nickel-cadmium or lead-acid batteries, they would have to be larger, adding more weight to the plane and cutting into the plane’s fuel-savings potential.Wednesday’s emergency landing was the latest in a string of incidents for the 787, which also included an electrical failure, fuel leaks and other smaller mishaps. But the latest event raised concerns that the 787’s problems were potentially more serious than thought and led to doubts about the plane’s safety and reliability.Lithium-ion batteries provide power more quickly than conventional batteries and can be recharged quickly. They are increasingly used in cellphones, computers and electric cars but also have known risks of fires and explosions, particularly if they overheat or overcharge.While the federal agency has recognized these hazards, it still decided in 2007 to allow Boeing to use them in the 787 as long as the company took a series of protective measures. At the time, the agency noted that “lithium ion batteries are significantly more susceptible to internal failures that can lead to self-sustaining increases in temperature and pressure” than conventional batteries.As part of Wednesday’s emergency directive, the government said it would “validate that the 787 batteries and the battery system on the aircraft are in compliance with the special condition the agency issued as part of the aircraft’s certification.”Eight airlines now fly the 787, which entered service in November 2011. All Nippon Airways and Japan Airlines in Japan own 24 of them. The other operators are Air India, Ethiopian Airlines, LAN Airlines of Chile, LOT of Poland and Qatar Airways. Orders for about 800 additional 787s are in the pipeline.The airplane’s six power generators produce enough electricity to power 500 houses. By contrast, the Boeing 777, a larger aircraft, can generate only a fifth of the 787’s electric power.Replacing batteries on the 787 with different ones, like metal hydride batteries, is theoretically possible but would be costly, said Hans J. Weber, the president of Tecop International, an aviation consulting firm.He estimated that different batteries could double the weight of the current systems and would be twice the size.“It’s not trivial, but it could be done,” Mr. Weber said.Boeing expects to sell 5,000 787s in the next 20 years. It is counting on the Dreamliner in the global sales battle with Airbus, its European rival, which plans to introduce its own carbon-composite plane, the A350, in the second half of 2014. Boeing has said that it outsourced too much of the work on the 787 to suppliers who were willing, collectively, to cover billions of dollars of the development costs, and many parts needed reworking.Boeing has said it expects to average a percentage profit in the low single digits on the first 1,100 planes, which could include deliveries into 2021. But David E. Strauss, an analyst at UBS, cautioned last month that Boeing’s production costs might remain too high for it to make a profit on any of the plane sales before 2021.While problems are common with the introduction of a new model — including the Airbus A380, the Boeing 777 and the Boeing 747 — analysts say the issue could become a growing embarrassment for Boeing if travelers or airlines begin to lose confidence in the Dreamliner."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/faa-directive-grounding-boeing-787s.html,"Following is the statement issued Wednesday evening by the Federal Aviation Administration ordering the temporary grounding of Boeing 787s operated by carriers in the United States: As a result of an in-flight, Boeing 787 battery incident earlier today in Japan, the FAA will issue an emergency airworthiness directive (AD) to address a potential battery fire risk in the 787 and require operators to temporarily cease operations.  Before further flight, operators of U.S.-registered, Boeing 787 aircraft must demonstrate to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) that the batteries are safe.    The FAA will work with the manufacturer and carriers to develop a corrective action plan to allow the U.S. 787 fleet to resume operations as quickly and safely as possible.The in-flight Japanese battery incident followed an earlier 787 battery incident that occurred on the ground in Boston on January 7, 2013. The AD is prompted by this second incident involving a lithium ion battery.  The battery failures resulted in release of flammable electrolytes, heat damage, and smoke on two Model 787 airplanes.  The root cause of these failures is currently under investigation.  These conditions, if not corrected, could result in damage to critical systems and structures, and the potential for fire in the electrical compartment.Last Friday, the FAA announced a comprehensive review of the 787’s critical systems with the possibility of further action pending new data and information.  In addition to the continuing review of the aircraft’s design, manufacture and assembly, the agency also will validate that 787 batteries and the battery system on the aircraft are in compliance with the special condition the agency issued as part of the aircraft’s certification.United Airlines is currently the only U.S. airline operating the 787, with six airplanes in service. When the FAA issues an airworthiness directive, it also alerts the international aviation community to the action so other civil aviation authorities can take parallel action to cover the fleets operating in their own countries."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/american-air-reports-a-profit.html,"American Airlines, which is in the final stages of bankruptcy and under pressure from US Airways to merge, on Wednesday reported a fourth-quarter profit mostly because of lower costs and some reorganization credits.Without these special items, including some bankruptcy-related tax benefits, the company had a loss in the quarter. In providing the figures, the carrier is eager to prove that its reorganization has been successful.A decision about the company’s fate could come in the next few weeks as the board of AMR, American’s corporate parent, considers its options. These include a merger with US Airways while American is still under Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.Pressure has been mounting for such an outcome. US Airways has repeatedly signaled its interest in a merger and last year struck a deal with American’s three labor groups, representing pilots, flight attendants and mechanics, to support such a consolidation. Since then, these groups have worked out a merger blueprint with their counterparts at US Airways.But American’s management has fought against a merger. It has argued that because of reorganization, the airline can compete on an equal footing against Delta Air Lines and United Airlines. Once the top carrier in the United States, American has been overtaken by those rivals, which both used mergers in recent years to become more formidable competitors.“We have made enormous progress towards building the new American,” Tom Horton, the airline’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. “Our momentum is growing toward emerging as a strong, healthy and vibrant competitor.”In the last year, American said, it has completed much of its reorganization. It cut its labor costs, pared its debt, renegotiated aircraft leases and airport agreements, grounded older planes, revamped its regional fleet and reviewed its supplier agreements. It has also placed a major order for 600 new planes. Last year, it took delivery of 30 aircraft — 28 Boeing 737-800s and two Boeing 777s — with extended range.In the fourth quarter, American had a net profit of $262 million, compared with a net loss of $1.1 billion in the year-earlier period. The figures include $350 million in positive reorganization and special items. Absent those, the carrier had an $88 million loss in the fourth quarter.For all of 2012, American lost $1.9 billion, compared with a loss of $2 billion in 2011. Revenue rose to $24.9 billion, the highest in the company’s history, compared with $24 billion the previous year.The company said it had $4.7 billion in cash and short-term investments, including a restricted cash balance of $850 million."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/supreme-court-hears-argument-on-cellphone-towers.html,"WASHINGTON — In June, two Texas cities asked the Supreme Court to decide a practical question and an abstract one, both concerning how quickly local zoning authorities have to respond to applications from telecommunications companies to build wireless towers.The practical question was whether the Federal Communications Commission was authorized to set time limits.But the Supreme Court, which includes four former law professors with an interest in administrative law, agreed to decide only the abstract question of whether an administrative agency like the commission may determine the scope of its own jurisdiction.At the argument of the case on Wednesday, some of the justices seemed content to tease apart the semantic distinctions posed by the second question, though there did not seem to be much enthusiasm for adding further complexity to an already tangled area.Others appeared frustrated that the court had gone out of its way to avoid having to give real-world guidance about a concrete and consequential issue.The case, City of Arlington v. Federal Communications Commission, No. 11-1545, concerns a 1996 federal law that requires state and local authorities to act “within a reasonable period of time” after receiving applications to build or alter wireless facilities. In response to a request from a trade association for the wireless industry, the commission made two decisions.First, it found that it had jurisdiction to define what a reasonable time was. Second, it said that 90 or 150 days were generally appropriate deadlines, depending on the circumstances.The Texas cities, Arlington and San Antonio, said Congress had not authorized the commission to act in the first place, pointing to a part of the law that said it was not meant to limit the power of state and local governments.The general rules in this area were set out in 1984 in Chevron v. Natural Resources Defense Council, which said that judges should defer to an administrative agency’s views when Congress itself has not spoken clearly.The additional question in the new case was whether Chevron’s general framework applies to an agency’s determination of whether it has the power to act in the first place. Several justices said it did.“The jurisdictional question, like any other question,” Justice Antonin Scalia said, “is to be decided with deference to the agency.”Justice Sonia Sotomayor appeared to agree, adding that it was hard to tell the two kinds of questions apart. “It’s almost impossible to talk about what’s jurisdictional and what’s an application of jurisdiction,” she said.A lawyer for the cities, Thomas C. Goldstein, responded that there are times when courts should draw distinctions between an agency’s general authority to interpret a law and its specific authority to interpret a particular provision of the law based on the text of the statute.Justice Elena Kagan said that was slicing things too fine. “Mr. Goldstein, at one level you are right,” she said. “It’s just a level that doesn’t help you very much.”At the end of the day, she said, it is all the same question. “We’ve just had some very simple rules about what gets you into the box where an agency is entitled to deference,” she said.Solicitor General Donald B. Verrilli Jr., representing the commission, said that a uniform approach was workable. The alternative proposed by the cities, he said, would “open a Pandora’s box” because there was no “clear, neat dividing line” between the two kinds of questions.Justice Stephen G. Breyer said the court should generally defer to agencies with expertise that lawmakers lack. “Congress, which is not expert, would have wanted the F.C.C. to figure this one out,” he said.But Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. said there might be a special reason not to defer to the commission in this case because it concerned a conflict between federal and state powers. Federal courts, he said, are better suited to policing that boundary than “an agency of unelected bureaucrats.”"

He remains anonymous because he cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and federal prosecutors; he is referred to only as C.W., legal parlance for cooperating witness.The indictment contains no particulars about the company owner or his motivation for cooperating with the authorities, and little is known about the details of his frequent victimization. Indeed, because he was working with the F.B.I. and prosecutors — and he may have been doing so because he himself had been charged with a crime and was seeking more lenient treatment — he may have been motivated to ensnare the men who prosecutors charge made him a victim.The charges in the case outline how the members and associates of three crime families — Genovese, Luchese and Gambino — controlled waste disposal businesses, dictating which companies could pick up trash where and extorting payments that ostensibly would entitle them to protection from other mob figures, court papers said.This system eliminated competitors who might provide better service or lower prices, or both, and in effect levied a mob tax on businesses and communities, according to the charges, in much the same way that the organized crime families in New York City did in the five boroughs two decades ago.The mob’s stranglehold over the carting industry in the city was broken in large measure by a sweeping racketeering case brought in 1995 by Robert M. Morgenthau, then the Manhattan district attorney, and the creation of a robust regulatory framework that would later become the Business Integrity Commission, which played a significant role in the indictment unsealed on Wednesday.The case seems to highlight the effectiveness of the experienced, well-financed and aggressive regulatory agency in keeping organized crime out of the carting industry. Many of the charges in the federal case are centered in areas with less aggressive or nonexistent industry oversight, and the indictments unsealed on Wednesday include no evidence of organized crime influence on companies licensed in New York City, where the Business Integrity Commission regulates hauling companies.But the company owned by the cooperating witness was very much the focus of organized crime figures. Competing factions vied for control of his company over the last three years, according to the indictment. And the case seems to suggest that outside New York City, the mob’s hold on the industry remains, in some part.The indictment also suggests that the accused gangsters — men with nicknames like Papa Smurf, Tony Lodi and Muzzy — were not reluctant to use some creative, if not particularly clandestine, approaches.Carmine Franco, for example, who is identified in the indictment as a Genovese associate and is one of those accused of extorting the carting company owner, arranged to replace the use of envelopes or paper bags for collecting payments. He instituted a sort of direct mob deposit.“When Franco controlled the C.W.’s company,” the indictment says, “Franco directed Franco’s bookkeeper to establish automatic monthly payments from the C.W.’s bank account.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/business/how-dell-became-entangled-in-options.html,"It was an amazing American success story, in which a college student in his dorm room created what became one of the largest computer companies in the world. In the 1990s, its share price tripled in each of three consecutive years. But after the bubble burst, it resorted to accounting fraud to persuade investors it was doing better than it really was.Now, nearly 25 years after it went public, Dell Inc. is reported to be considering leaving the public arena by going private in what would be the largest leveraged buyout in years. The company is no longer viewed as a leader, and its share price is less than it was a decade ago.For most of its history, Dell appears to have followed advice from investment banks — advice that ill-served long-term shareholders to the benefit of corporate executives. The company paid out billions of dollars to buy back stock, and only last year began to distribute some of the money to shareholders who chose to stick with it rather than bail out.It has spent more money on share repurchases than it earned throughout its life as a public company. Most of those repurchases were at prices well above current levels.Here’s the breakdown so far: Cash paid by the company to shareholders who were bailing out: $39.7 billion. Cash paid in dividends to shareholders who chose to hold on to their shares: $139 million. Current market value of the company: about $22 billion.Along the way, profits for Dell executives from stock options soared to amazing levels, and Michael S. Dell, the founder, chairman and chief executive, evidently concluded he had erred by not taking options during the company’s early years.In 1994, the company’s proxy stated “Mr. Dell does not participate in Dell’s long-term incentive program because of his significant stock ownership.” That changed in 1995, and in 1998 he received more than 20 percent of the options the company issued. His options eventually produced profits of more than $650 million for him.This column is not about Dell’s business successes and struggles, which have been well covered elsewhere. It instead looks at the company as an example of financial management and mismanagement — and at the impact foolish accounting rules can have on corporate policies and behavior.The primary accounting rule involved here was for stock options, but the general rule that companies do not need to record profits or losses on transactions in their own stock also played a role, allowing companies to routinely sell low and buy high without ever reporting a loss.Until 2005, companies could pretend that stock options they handed out to employees and executives were worthless, and therefore not show them as an expense, as they would if they paid the employee in cash or even in shares of stock. The logic to the rule was that since the options would in the end be valuable only if the share price rose, there was no need to record an expense when the options were issued. Anyway, the companies said, this was a cashless expense. The company would not have to pay a penny, so why record an expense?Accountants realized years ago that made no sense, and in the 1990s the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which sets American accounting rules, moved to change the rule. Companies, particularly technology companies, reacted as if capitalism itself were under attack. Make them account for options, they said, and people would stop buying their shares and America’s technological innovation would come to an end.That argument did not persuade the accountants, but it — and a lot of campaign contributions — had more impact on Capitol Hill. In 1994, the Senate voted 88 to 9 in favor of a resolution threatening to put the accounting standards board out of business if it did not back down. The board surrendered, and it was another decade before it recovered its nerve.One trouble with the argument that no cash was involved was that in practice it was far from true. Many companies, Dell among them, sought to reassure shareholders that they would suffer no dilution through the issuance of stock options, vowing to buy back as many shares as they issued through options.That did prevent dilution, but at a high cost. If a company issued a million shares to executives who cashed in options allowing them to buy the shares at $10 each, it took in $10 million. If it bought back a million shares at the same time, when the price was $25, it was out a net $15 million. That loss would not show up on the income statement, but it would be very real.In 1996, Dell came up with a strategy to deal with that. It began to speculate in options on its own stock. It bought call options allowing it to purchase shares at a fixed price several years out. And it sold put options, requiring it to purchase stock at a preset price years later if the other party wanted to sell.The first time Dell did that, it made a mistake and it had to reduce its book value based on the possible hit. In future deals it specified that it could settle the put contracts in stock rather than cash. It made no sense that it would actually do so, since doing that would produce incredible dilution from a strategy that was supposed to avoid dilution. But putting that clause in enabled it to pretend that it was not committing itself to pay cash, and could therefore keep the transaction out of its income statement.When the stock was rising, the strategy worked. But after the share price fell, Dell was in trouble. It stopped selling puts in late 2000, but the puts forced it to effectively buy stock for far more than the stock was worth.In 2001, Dell began an accounting fraud that continued until 2006. It pumped up profits by taking undisclosed payments from Intel for agreeing to use only Intel chips in its computers. As the Securities and Exchange Commission later wrote when it fined Dell $100 million, the company “wrongfully made it appear that Dell was consistently meeting Wall Street earnings targets and reducing its operating expenses through the company’s management and operations.” When those payments stopped, profits plunged and the company lied about the reason.In addition to the fine, the company paid $40 million to settle a class-action suit, and Mr. Dell personally paid a $4 million fine.Why did Dell cook its books? Part of the answer may be that the potential costs of settling the put contracts made executives more desperate to impress Wall Street and keep the stock price up.Whether or not that is the case, the strategy left Dell with a big cash outflow at a time when it could have used the money to deal with major challenges to its business, challenges that it does not appear to have met very well.The excessive use of stock options — at Dell and other companies — had other unfortunate effects. Because executives whose wealth was in options would profit if the stock price went up, but not if the company paid a dividend, companies were inclined to avoid dividends that would benefit their loyal shareholders, and instead repurchase stock.Because the number of shares to be repurchased came to be tied to the number of options exercised, the effect was to encourage companies to repurchase shares when the price was high, and to stop doing so when the price fell. Because the value of options was hidden, it encouraged companies to use them rather than other methods of pay, such as restricted stock or cash bonuses. It is no accident that restricted stock has become much more popular — at Dell and other companies — since options accounting finally was reformed in 2005.Late last year Dell finally began paying a dividend on its common stock. The second quarterly dividend is set for next week.Dell’s share price climbed above $12 this week on reports of a possible leveraged buyout. That contrasts with an average price of under $5 that the company received from employees who exercised options, and with an average price of $19 that it paid over the years to buy back shares, many of them from the same employees.It is far from clear that a leveraged buyout of Dell will happen, and its bonds are trading as if bondholders don’t think it will. A deal would be easier if Dell had kept a few billion dollars and used it to pay down debt, rather than spend it on stock that turned out to be overvalued. And it might have been unnecessary had the company paid more attention to its business, and less to financial engineering."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/technology/intel-earnings-are-sharply-lower.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Intel has money, smart people and resolve, but it still doesn’t have a quick fix for the deterioration of its largest market — personal computers.The world’s biggest maker of semiconductors, which grew by supplying chips to most of the world’s personal computer makers, is now facing an erosion of that market. According to Gartner, a market analysis firm, PC shipments worldwide declined 3.5 percent in 2012.The result was evident Thursday in Intel’s fourth-quarter earnings report. The company, which is based in Santa Clara, Calif., reported net income of $2.5 billion, or 48 cents a share, down 27 percent from $3.4 billion, or 64 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue fell 3 percent to $13.5 billion from $13.9 billion.“The PC business as we’ve known it is evolving,” said Paul S. Otellini, Intel’s chief executive, in a call to analysts. “The form factors are going to blur here.”Instead of PCs, more people and businesses are buying smartphones and tablets. Intel gets 64 percent of its revenues and some of its highest profit margins from chips for PCs. It has scrambled to revive the market, while it aggressively tries to supply tablet and smartphone makers, so far with little success.But even as it gets harder to sell PCs, Intel appears to have managed its business better than many investors thought possible. Revenue was in line with analysts’ expectations, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters, but net income was higher than the 45 cents a share that the analysts were expecting, on average.Intel projected lower revenue and pressure on its profit margins for 2013, however, which sent its shares down about 5 percent in after-hours trading. Intel shares finished regular trading at $22.68, up 57 cents.At the after-hours price, Intel’s market capitalization dropped below that of Qualcomm — a smaller maker of chips, but a company that makes chips for smartphones and tablets. Even a year ago, this would have been unthinkable.Over the last six months, shares of Intel have fallen about 18 percent, while Qualcomm’s stock is up almost 20 percent. ARM Holdings, which sells designs for low-power chips popular in mobile devices, is up almost 90 percent in that time.“Longer term, Intel will move more aggressively into smartphones,” said Bobby Burleson, an analyst with Canaccord Genuity. “But everyone worries about their long-term gross margins.”Intel, which employs an engineering-focused staff of 105,000 people, plans to continue to invest heavily in research and development, as well as new manufacturing facilities. Intel operates on the principle that making the biggest volumes of the most advanced chips gives it a quality and profit margin advantage.Despite the lower earnings, Intel said it would spend $18.9 billion on research and development, along with marketing and administrative costs, in 2013. Two years ago Intel spent $16 billion on those things, increasing that amount to $18.2 billion last year.“Our manufacturing leadership becomes increasingly valuable,” said Stacy J. Smith, Intel’s chief financial officer. “People expect Intel to make more powerful, more efficient devices. That applies across all our businesses.”That works, as long as the chips have buyers. Last year Intel hoped two PC industry initiatives would woo buyers back to PCs, but neither did. One, backed by a large investment from Intel, was in lightweight ultrabook laptop computers, many of which had tablet features, like touch screens. These came to market later than analysts had expected, at prices most consumers did not find attractive.The other, Microsoft’s release of its Windows 8 operating system, has so far failed to excite buyers. Consumers and businesses did not buy new computers in order to use the upgraded system.Mr. Otellini remained upbeat about ultrabooks, saying that there were now 140 types of the lightweight laptops on the market. The number of styles and different ways they use things like keyboards and touch screens, he said, would make it harder to tell a PC from a tablet.“We’re in the midst of a radical transformation with the blurring of form factors,” he said, adding that this year Intel would introduce a new chip, called Haswell, which would help in the production of lightweight machines that have longer battery life. He said little about Windows 8.Intel’s second-largest business, chips for computer servers in data centers, reflected an overall strength in that industry. Fourth-quarter sales to data centers was $2.8 billion, an increase of 4 percent from a year earlier."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/business/att-warns-of-10-billion-fourth-quarter-charge-for-pension-costs.html,"AT&T warned late Thursday that it would take a fourth-quarter charge of about $10 billion because of bigger-than-expected pension obligations.The telephone company also said its results for the period would be depressed by high smartphone costs and damage from Hurricane Sandy.It said the pension charge was related to an actuarial loss of about $12 billion, which was partially offset by an asset gain of about $1.9 billion.AT&T also said it was lowering its expected long-term rate of return because of continued uncertainty in the securities markets and the American economy.“It’s not a real huge negative, but a little bit sobering,” said Michael Bowen, an analyst with Pacific Crest Securities. “They are saying their obligations are larger than they thought they were.”While AT&T said the pension loss would not affect its operating results or margins, it warned that its fourth-quarter earnings would be hurt by other issues.It said it expected to report a $175 million reduction in its operating income because of storms, including Hurricane Sandy, which damaged cellphone towers and caused service failures in the Northeast in late October.Mr. Bowen said the estimate of storm-related costs seemed “a little bit light” compared with his expectations.AT&T said its wireless profit would also be reduced by higher-than-expected smartphone sales in the quarter. Because the company pays a hefty subsidy for each smartphone it sells, high sales tend to put pressure on its wireless profit margins. It pays subsidies so that it can offer discounts to consumers who commit to long-term contracts.AT&T disclosed the charge after the stock market closed. Its shares fell as much as 55 cents, or 1.7 percent, to $32.65 in after-hours trading after ending down 6 cents in regular trading."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/us/politics/hard-choices-on-debt-if-the-us-hits-the-ceiling.html,"WASHINGTON — By mid-February or early March, the United States could face an unprecedented default unless it raises its debt ceiling, the Treasury Department said this week.Some legislators have theorized that a quick breach in the debt ceiling might cause only a minor disruption to government finances. And some commentators have suggested that the United States could pass legislation to prioritize or guarantee payments to bondholders, thus erasing what they describe as the worst of the financial market reaction and removing the threat of technical default.But experts in government finance and markets described running up against the debt ceiling as an event that might quickly precipitate a financial crisis and eventually lead to a recession — an event with far greater disruptive potential than the “fiscal cliff” package of tax increases and spending cuts, a government shutdown or even the collapse of Lehman Brothers.A debt-ceiling crisis would be at its heart a cash-management problem. Every day the government receives millions of bills to pay, to its employees, older Americans, soldiers, bondholders and contractors, among others. Under normal circumstances, it makes payments with new revenue as well as with the proceeds from bond sales. But the country has already run out of authority to issue new debt, as of Dec. 31, and Congress has not yet raised the statutory debt ceiling, currently around $16.4 trillion.The Treasury Department is undertaking “extraordinary measures,” like suspending the reinvestment of certain government retirement funds, to leave it with more cash on hand. But such measures buy the country only so much time, and in a matter of weeks outflows will overwhelm inflows.That day might be Feb. 15, for instance. According to a Bipartisan Policy Center analysis, the government expects about $9 billion in revenue to arrive in its coffers that day. But it has $52 billion in committed spending on that day: $30 billion in interest payments, $6.8 billion in tax refunds, $3.5 billion in federal salaries, $2.7 billion in military pay, $2.3 billion in Medicaid and Medicare payments, $1.5 billion owed to military contractors and a smattering of other commitments.The Treasury would be confronted with paying doctors but not soldiers, Chinese bondholders but not defense companies. Worse, it is not clear whether the Treasury secretary would have the legal latitude or even the technical ability to prioritize some payments over others. Every day the country remained in breach of the ceiling, the problems would be compounded.The Treasury Department has shed little light on what actions it would take if the country breached the ceiling.But there are a few clues as to how the Obama administration might react. A Treasury inspector general’s report from last year described some of the planning for the debt ceiling standoff in 2011, which caused a broad slump in the market and raised the country’s borrowing costs by about $1.3 billion in that fiscal year. “Treasury considered asset sales; imposing across-the-board payment reductions; various ways of attempting to prioritize payments; and various ways of delaying payments,” the report said.It determined that delaying payments might be the least harmful option, but made no decisions about the best route forward. Moreover, “Treasury reached the same conclusion that other administrations had reached about these options — none of them could reasonably protect the full faith and credit of the U.S., the American economy, or individual citizens from very serious harm,” the report said.Some Republican lawmakers have suggested giving the Treasury more guidance. For instance, Representative Daniel Webster of Florida has put forward a bill ordering the Treasury to pay obligations to bondholders, followed by troops, national security “priorities,” Social Security and then Medicare.But organized chaos would still be chaos, analysts said. Consider again the day of Feb. 15. The country would not have enough money to pay its bondholders, let alone anyone else. Moreover, analysts have raised questions about whether the Treasury would be able to reprogram its automated payment systems to prioritize some payments over others. With bills stacking up day by day, the government would be able to make only about 60 percent of its payments over time.Businesses and individuals would be left without expected funds from the government, and a tremendous financial crisis might ensue. “We’re the reserve currency of the entire world,” said Steve Bell of the Bipartisan Policy Center, in Washington. “There’s trillions of dollars of our debt sliced and diced into all sorts of financial instruments around the world. If you’re a 28-year-old bond trader for Nomura in Tokyo, and someone says, ‘Hey, we just heard a rumor Treasury isn’t making all its payments,’ what do you do? You panic and you sell.”For that reason, 84 percent of the top economists surveyed by the University of Chicago’s Booth School of Business this week said the debt ceiling “periodically creates unneeded uncertainty and can potentially lead to worse fiscal outcomes” for the country.“Deciding whether or not to pay the debts incurred to fund the previously approved tax and spending is nuts,” responded Anil K. Kashyap of the University of Chicago.Richard H. Thaler, also of Chicago, said, “The debt ceiling is a dumb idea with no benefits and potentially catastrophic costs if ever used.”A standoff in the debt ceiling — even a brief one, with bondholders paid on time — might also raise the country’s borrowing costs permanently. “It is not assured that the Treasury would or legally could prioritize debt service over its myriad other obligations, including Social Security payments, tax rebates and payments to contractors and employees,” Fitch, the major ratings agency, said on Tuesday. “Arrears on such obligations would not constitute a default event from a sovereign rating perspective but very likely prompt a downgrade even as debt obligations continued to be met.”For that reason, some Republicans are shying away from using the debt ceiling as leverage — with some quietly suggesting that a forthcoming debate over the continuing spending resolution necessary to finance the government might be a better time to wrangle for budget cuts.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Speaker John A. Boehner described the debt ceiling as “one point of leverage” but “not the ultimate leverage.” The White House has refused to negotiate any budget cuts as part of talks over the ceiling, and has suggested that Congress give up most its authority over the debt ceiling to begin with."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/business/economy/claims-for-jobless-benefits-drop.html,"The number of Americans filing new claims for unemployment benefits hit a five-year low last week and residential construction surged in December, the latest signs that the American economic recovery remains on track.The reports on Thursday showed the economy was weathering an uncertain fiscal environment surprisingly well. Still, growth in the fourth quarter was most likely subdued, and only a modest pickup was expected in the first three months of this year.“While growth has been slow, the damage done from the uncertainty surrounding the fiscal cliff was not sufficient to topple the recovery,” said Millan Mulraine, a senior economist at TD Securities in New York.The fiscal cliff refers to deep government spending cuts and tax increases, many of which were avoided after a last-minute agreement in Congress. A fight over raising the government’s borrowing limit looms.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits fell 37,000 to a seasonally adjusted 335,000, the lowest level since January 2008, the Labor Department said on Thursday. It was the largest weekly drop since February 2010, ending four straight weeks of increases.While problems adjusting the data for seasonal fluctuations might have exaggerated the size of the decline, economists said the report still suggested an improvement in the labor market and the economy as a whole.“Having taken a pinch of salt, however, we would suggest that the trend in claims generally show no pickup in layoff activity around the turn of the year,” said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics in New York.A separate report from the Commerce Department showed housing starts jumped 12.1 percent last month to their highest level since June 2008. Permits for home construction were also the highest in about 4 1/2 years.The data was confirmation that the housing market was improving, aided in part by favorable weather, with gains in home building across all four regions in the survey. Groundbreaking increased for both single-family homes and multifamily units.Housing appeared to no longer be a drag on the economy and residential construction was expected to have contributed to growth last year for the first time since 2005.The jobs and housing data helped United States stocks surge. The reports came on the heels of data this week showing solid retail sales and manufacturing growth in December.Still, the outlook for the economy remains shaky. A report showed that factory activity in the mid-Atlantic region had contracted this month as new orders tumbled, pointing to a cooling in manufacturing activity.The Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank said its business activity index fell to minus 5.8 from minus 4.6 in December. A reading below zero indicates contraction in manufacturing in eastern Pennsylvania, southern New Jersey and Delaware.“Manufacturing has slowed but it’s still growing,” said Gus Faucher, a senior economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh. “I’m not going to read too much into this until I see other regional surveys."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/opinion/when-countries-cant-pay-their-debts.html,"A recent court decision in a long-running legal battle between investors and the government of Argentina has highlighted problems with restructuring the debts of countries that fall on hard times. The case, which is being fought in federal court in New York, suggests that policy makers must develop a more systematic way to deal with sovereign defaults.The case deals with Argentina’s decision in 2001 to stop paying debts worth about $80 billion. The country eventually reached deals with most of its investors and banks to forgive most of the amount that they were owed. But some bondholders, including the hedge funds Elliott Management and Aurelius Capital, held out for a better deal and sued Argentina.Until recently, the Argentina case has been a quixotic pursuit because American law makes it hard to collect money from other countries. But late last year, Judge Thomas P. Griesa of Federal District Court ruled that Argentina had to pay the holdouts as long as it was paying the investors who had agreed to the restructuring because the country couldn’t favor some investors over others under the terms of its bonds. Because Argentina has previously refused to pay the holdouts, the judge further ordered the banks and other intermediaries the country uses to make the payments from the money it sent to them. The United States Appeals Court for the Second Circuit will soon hear an appeal of that decision, which has alarmed the Obama administration, banks and other countries because it could affect other cases.The Argentina case, while unusual for being so drawn out, is just one of a rising tide of litigation involving defaults by countries. One recent study found the likelihood of such cases has more than doubled compared with the 1980s, and there were 61 cases initiated in the last decade. One explanation for the increase is that these debts are increasingly held by hedge funds, rather than banks, which often settle under pressure from policy makers in Washington and London. The threat of litigation dogged the recent renegotiation of Greek debt, which was ultimately resolved out of court after changes to local laws and intervention by European officials.These cases have reawakened interest in an old proposal by the International Monetary Fund for a system of resolving the debts of countries that would be similar to corporate bankruptcy. The fund would oversee the process and another agency would make sure countries and their creditors come to terms that apply to all creditors.That proposal has been blocked by the United States and others because they are uncomfortable about amending their laws and creating another international agency. They, and some in the financial industry, argue that many countries have been adding clauses to their bond contracts that all bondholders must accept a restructuring if two-thirds or three-fourths of bondholders vote to do so. These provisions would make it easier to negotiate settlements, but they do not address problems that arise when countries have multiple kinds of debts.Some officials in the European Union are proposing a formal restructuring system for its member countries. Other nations may need to follow Europe’s lead if these kinds of suits start imposing onerous strains and responsibilities on banks and other players in the financial system."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/business/american-express-income-falls-on-reorganization-costs.html,"American Express reported Thursday that its fourth-quarter net income fell 47 percent, as the credit card issuer racked up charges related to reorganization costs and other one-time expenses. But the company’s adjusted results exceeded Wall Street’s expectations.The company, which is based in Manhattan, had previously alerted investors that its earnings would be taking a hit in the October-to-December period as a result of booking about $594 million in after-tax charges.The biggest portion of the costs pertains to a revamping plan that involves cutting some 5,400 jobs, mostly from the company’s travel business. The strategy aims to put the company in better position to cater to customers increasingly turning to online and mobile devices to shop, pay bills and make travel plans.The rest of the charges were related to the company’s cardholder rewards program and for reimbursements of interest and fees.Expenses aside, American Express was lifted by an 8 percent increase in cardholder spending during the quarter, which coincided with the holiday season, regularly a period of heightened spending by consumers.American Express cardholders tend to be more affluent than other credit card users, and the company has done well in the slow, bumpy recovery from the recession.The company has noted that credit card authorization volume surpassed previous single-day volumes 12 times during the quarter.American Express reported net income of $637 million, or 56 cents a share, for the three months ended Dec. 31. That compares with net income of $1.2 billion, or $1.01 a share, in the fourth quarter of 2011.Excluding the after-tax charges, American Express’s earnings amounted to $1.09 a share. Analysts polled by FactSet were expecting adjusted earnings of $1.06 a share.The company’s revenue for the quarter grew 5 percent, to $8.14 billion, in line with analysts’ forecast.Shares of American Express rose 12 cents in after-hours trading after closing at $60.62."

The Dow Jones industrial average also rose, climbing to a five-year high during the day, before falling back to finish 84.79 points higher, or 0.63 percent, at 13,596.02. The Nasdaq composite index climbed 18.46 points, or 0.59 percent, to 3,136.Builders started work on homes in December at the fastest rate since the summer of 2008, the Commerce Department said Thursday. Home builder stocks rose broadly after the report. The S.& P. 500’s home building index climbed 3.8 percent, its biggest gain in almost a month. The Pulte Group led the advance with a jump of $1.03, or 5.33 percent, to $20.37.The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell to a five-year low last week, the Labor Department reported, the latest sign that the job market is healing. Weekly unemployment benefit applications fell 37,000, to 335,000, a bigger decline than economists had forecast, according to a financial data provider, FactSet.The reports helped offset disappointment over the fourth-quarter earnings reports of two of the nation’s biggest banks, Citigroup and Bank of America, said Joe Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist at TD Ameritrade.“The financial stocks are having a tough time impressing the Street with anything,” Mr. Kinahan said. “The traditional banks are getting squeezed on margins and the expectations for a lot of those companies had already been set low.”Citigroup fell $1.24, or 2.92 percent, to $41.24, after its income fell well short of Wall Street’s expectations. The bank’s legal expenses rose and it released less money from its loan-loss reserves.Bank of America dropped 50 cents, or 4.24 percent, to $11.28, after its earnings declined. The bank is continuing to work on clearing up problems at its mortgage unit. The bank made $367 million in the last three months of 2012 after paying preferred dividends, down sharply from $1.58 billion in the period a year earlier.Kim Caughey Forrest, a senior analyst at Fort Pitt Capital, said it was too early to conclude that the housing market had turned the corner. She noted that a large “shadow inventory” of houses that still need to be foreclosed on may weigh on house prices in the coming months. “This rally is probably a little bit too optimistic for the information that we got,” she said. “There’s some conflicting information here, and the market has just decided to overlook the negative thing.”The indexes rose even though more discouraging news about manufacturing came out.

Deutsche Bank analysts lifted their target price on the stock to $47 from $40, saying the conversion to an investment trust “meaningfully enhances value.”BlackRock, the investment manager, gained $9.76, or 4.39 percent, to $232, after posting higher fourth-quarter net income that beat analysts’ forecasts.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/business/negotiation-experts-consider-how-to-reach-a-budget-deal.html,"The Republican leadership blinked.They agreed Friday to postpone their showdown with President Obama for three months after initially vowing there would be no deal on raising the debt ceiling without spending cuts. But before they and the Democrats embark on yet another round of contentious and seemingly dysfunctional tax and budget talks, here’s a simple suggestion: a crash course in negotiating tactics.When I broached the idea to Daylian Cain, who teaches a popular class in negotiating at the Yale School of Management, he immediately volunteered to take his course to Washington. “I’ll show up with my PowerPoints and a bottle of Scotch,” he said.What might President Obama, House Speaker John Boehner and the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell, the most vocal participants in the latest standoff, learn? Perhaps that they’ve been falling into some classic but avoidable pitfalls, and that they could achieve some of their most important goals without subjecting the financial markets, the American people and the global economy to yet another high-stakes and damaging game of chicken.“This isn’t rocket science,” William Ury told me this week. Dr. Ury, along with Roger Fisher, who was a law professor at Harvard at the time, wrote the classic work on negotiating, “Getting to Yes,” and has been refining his insights at the Program on Negotiation at Harvard Law School. “It’s sad to watch this kind of brinkmanship,” he said. “There are plenty of ways to arrive at a good, responsible agreement that’s satisfactory to each side and, above all, is good for the country. You could put some high school students together and they could do it.”Seth Freeman, who teaches negotiation and conflict management at Columbia Business School and N.Y.U.’s Stern School of Business, added: “I’m marveling at the postures each side is taking, given the stakes. It gives you vertigo.”Mr. Obama and the Republican leaders have shown scant evidence that they’ve absorbed any of the lessons that are now standard fare in the nation’s leading law and business schools. In each successive round of talks, they’ve expressed mounting anger and frustration, which only creates “huge and unnecessary obstacles to reaching an agreement,” Dr. Ury said.Until the Republicans gave in on Friday, their positions seemed only to have hardened. Mr. Obama said he wouldn’t even talk to Republican leaders about raising the debt ceiling, saying at a news conference this week that “they will not collect a ransom in exchange for not crashing the American economy.” This is a standard negotiating stance, which is refusing to even discuss an issue, coupled with some provocative name-calling, since the use of  “ransom” suggests that Republicans are pirates or hostage takers.“That’s a very high-risk, high-return approach,” Professor Freeman said.“If you can convince the other side you are truly committed to your position and there’s no going back, and the other side believes you, you can win. But if not, and they call your bluff, you’ve got a Dr. Strangelove situation. I see similar rhetoric from the Republican side.”For their part, the Republicans were taking a similarly hard line, at least until Friday. Mr. Boehner said he wouldn’t engage in any more one-on-one negotiations with Mr. Obama, and both he and Mr. McConnell had said they wouldn’t support raising the debt ceiling without addressing the deficit with spending cuts. They also refused to discuss further tax increases, saying that Republicans are “done” with that after the fiscal cliff deal raised taxes on the wealthy.Dr. Ury said Thomas Schelling, a former economist at Harvard, compared the standoff to two trucks hurtling toward each other. One driver rips out the steering wheel and throws it out the window.Professor Cain described the standoff as a “game of chicken” where “each side refuses to swerve.”Basically, he continued, “this tactic aims at claiming a large portion of the pie: ‘Give me everything or I walk.’ That’s a very aggressive approach, and doesn’t foster creative deal-making at all. There’s no communication, so there’s little chance for a win-win outcome. So far, this has been a vicious circle. Each round of negotiations has been worse than the last and has begotten hostility. Reputations are on the line. Obama is worried about being too soft, so he’s being super firm. Boehner faces a revolt in the House.”Professor Cain recommended some lower-stress social events, like a bipartisan White House poker game with Congressional leaders.“Maybe they could build some social capital for cliffs to come,” he said.Dr. Ury added, “So much of what we’re seeing is being driven by emotion, anger, frustration and feelings of betrayal.” In all negotiations, he said, “a key is to distinguish between the people and the merits. It doesn’t have to be so personal. Both sides need to take a deep breath, keep their eyes on the prize, and focus on what will serve their party and the needs of the nation.”Dr. Ury calls this “going to the balcony,” which means to step back, let emotions simmer down and cultivate a more objective view of what the sides have in common.Professor Freeman agreed that “you don’t have to like each other to get a deal, even a good one.”He noted that history is filled with examples of successful negotiations between bitter enemies, like the one that resulted in the Arab-Israeli Camp David peace accords.What dismayed all the experts I spoke to was that the hostile tone was obscuring the fact that both sides agreed on the two most fundamental issues; the debt ceiling needs to be raised and a government default avoided, and the long-term deficit needs to be addressed through some combination of spending cuts and tax increases.“They have a lot of common ground,” Professor Cain said. “At the end of the day, these are patriotic Americans who care about their country and are devoting their professional lives to making America better. They’re under partisan pressures, but they’re similar. They can surely sympathize with each other, one would think.”The three experts I consulted agreed that Mr. Obama had the stronger hand. But for any real progress, both sides need a face-saving way to reach a compromise. Each needs to get something to sell to its constituency. “In any negotiation, you have to think both about how you get what you want and how you help the other side save face.“ Professor Cain said. Professor Freeman added: “How do Boehner and McConnell deal with Tea Party, talk radio, Fox News, their base? If they can find some way to declare victory, some measure of cover, that may be a way out.”Dr. Ury offered a possible solution: President Obama could agree to begin longer-term debt and spending negotiations now, and Republicans would drop their objections to raising the debt ceiling, without explicitly linking the two. “Both sides get something,” Dr. Ury said. “The president would strengthen his hand and it would be good for the country. He could convey the message that to get spending cuts, you don’t have to hold a gun to the head of the country. The Republicans would be hard-pressed to say no. They can say that spending cuts are back on the table. They could aim for a ‘Grand Bargain’ or maybe a series of smaller bargains.”That’s pretty close to what the Republicans have now proposed, which is tethering an agreement to raise the debt ceiling to a pledge to engage in long-term deficit reduction.Lurching from one fiscal cliff to another and the lack of constructive engagement by the nation’s leaders seems to have left all three negotiating experts shaking their heads. “Their behavior seems juvenile, but these are smart people,” Professor Cain said. “I guess there can be stupidity at the highest levels, but when I see something so reckless and scary, I wonder, is there something I don’t know about the situation? I figure there must be more going on, because otherwise it certainly seems scary to me.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/nyregion/1-1-billion-deal-is-reached-to-buy-sony-building.html,"Joseph Chetrit, the media-shy real estate investor, is considering converting the Sony Building on Madison Avenue at 55th Street into a luxury hotel with condominiums at the top and a retail arcade at the bottom, according to real estate executives.Mr. Chetrit led a consortium that signed a contract Thursday to pay $1.1 billion for the 37-story tower, which has an 80-foot arched entranceway and distinctive Chippendale top, after outbidding 21 rivals, including the developer Harry Macklowe and the Japanese company Mitsui Fudosan.“It’s 2007 all over again,” said Dan Fasulo of Real Capital Analytics. “It’s a real trophy in a great location, but that’s a big number for a transitional asset.”Mr. Chetrit’s company, the Chetrit Group, did not return calls requesting comment on the sale and its pending plans. The company owns stakes in apartment buildings in Manhattan and the Willis Tower (formerly the Sears Tower) and other office buildings in Chicago. But it has focused recently on hotels, buying the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan and a string of hotels in Miami Beach.The deal is expected to close in March.The sale is a boon for the current owner, Sony Corporation, which plans to remain in the building for up to three years before moving elsewhere in Manhattan. That would provide time for the Chetrit Group to develop its plans and renovate the 30-year-old tower.Sony bought the tower from AT&T in 2002 for about $236 million and hired Douglas Harmon and Ben Lambert of Eastdil Secured last year to market the building, hoping to get at least $1 billion. The building, which sits in a neighborhood rife with luxury hotels, shops and condominiums, drew intense interest from Vornado Realty Trust, Mitsubishi Trust, RXR Realty and others.In December, 21 bidders lined up with differing plans for retail, condominiums, hotels and office space. Earlier this week, Sony negotiated simultaneously with four finalists, each willing to pay more than a billion dollars."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/business/economy/car-sales-continue-to-fall-in-many-developed-countries.html,"THE United States’ industrial economy has finally returned to where it was in 2006, something that few other major developed countries have accomplished. But car sales, a sign of consumer economic health and confidence, remain well below the level of six years ago across the spectrum of countries. In Europe, car sales fell last year to the lowest level since 1995.The Federal Reserve Board reported this week that its industrial production index climbed 2.2 percent in 2012. That represents a slowing of the growth rate from 2010 and 2011, but still left the index slightly above the 2006 average.That index peaked in December 2007, just as the recession began, and remains below that peak. There have been only two periods since 1921 in which it took longer for production to recover fully. One, lasting just over six years, came after production peaked during World War II. The other, lasting more than seven years, came during the Great Depression.The accompanying charts show the trends in the two indicators in the largest developed countries. The constant, if slow, increases shown in the United States since the economy hit bottom in 2009 have not been matched in any of the other countries. German industrial production is above where it was in 2006, but has been declining for more than a year.In much of Europe, the idea that there has been a recovery at all seems doubtful. Car sales did spike higher in 2009, but that was largely because of temporary government-financed incentives that provided money to buyers who traded in older cars for new, presumably more fuel-efficient vehicles.Britain also announced a tax increase that could be avoided if car buyers acted quickly, and many did. Sales fell off sharply in most of Europe after the incentives expired, and have continued to decline.New-car sales can be a particularly sensitive economic indicator because few people really need to buy a new car, and thus tend not to do so when they feel uncertain about their economic prospects. Even if a car purchase can no longer be delayed, a used car is an alternative.The charts show car sales over 12-month periods, compared with the figures in each country for 2006. They exclude light truck sales, a category that includes sport utility vehicles and minivans. Such vehicles are normally included in the United States when counting car sales but excluded in other countries, where they are more likely to be used by businesses than families.In 2012, car sales in the United States were 7 percent below the level of 2006. Sales in Japan had recovered to within 6 percent of the 2006 total. But in most European countries, sales are well below precrisis levels and are continuing to fall.A couple of years ago, the periphery of the euro zone appeared to be in a recession, but the core countries of the zone seemed to be doing relatively well. That has changed, and not because the periphery has improved.Germany reported this week that its economy declined in the final quarter of 2012, and France also seems to be in decline. But in neither of those countries have car sales and industrial production plunged as rapidly as they have in Italy and Spain. Spain’s car sales are now less than half the level of six years ago."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/business/hsbc-will-pay-249-million-to-settle-foreclosure-review-case.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The United States arm of the British bank HSBC Holdings agreed to pay $249 million to end a case-by-case review of past home foreclosures in the United States, bringing the total payout by banks to resolve related issues to $9.3 billion.HSBC agreed to pay $96 million to eligible borrowers who lost their homes to foreclosure in 2009 and 2010, and provide $153 million in other assistance, including loan modifications and forgiveness.The bank said it was pleased to have reached the agreement and expected to record a pretax charge of $96 million in the fourth quarter of 2012 for the cash portion of the settlement. The bank said it expected to cover the loan assistance through existing reserves.The settlement, with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board, is the 13th the agencies have reached this month.The agreements stem from the reviews of individual loan files that regulators ordered in 2011 and 2012, after widespread mistakes were discovered in the way mortgage servicers had processed home seizures.The reviews, initially expected to determine which borrowers were harmed and to compensate them based on their individual experiences, proved slow and expensive.Ten banks, including Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, agreed to pay a total of $8.5 billion — some in cash, and the rest in loan assistance — to end the reviews last week.On Wednesday, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley agreed to a similar $557 million deal.About 112,000 borrowers whose homes were in foreclosure with HSBC Bank and other HSBC subsidiaries will receive some cash, regulators said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/business/global/chinese-economy-picks-up-steam-in-last-quarter.html,"HONG KONG — The giant Chinese economy picked up steam during the last few months of 2012, closely watched data from Beijing on Friday confirmed. But at the same time the figures underlined the view that the pace of future growth is likely to remain well below that seen in recent years.China’s gross domestic product expanded 7.9 percent during the final quarter of last year, compared to a year earlier — slightly better than expectations, and significantly above the 7.4 percent pace recorded during the previous quarter.Separate data for the month of December also came in a touch better than analysts had forecast: Retail sales expanded 15.2 percent from a year earlier, and industrial output grew 10.3 percent. Both figures were slightly better than those recorded in November.The growth data “was the best we could have wished for,” Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Crédit Agricole in Hong Kong, commented in a note. The figures “should put at rest any remaining doubt about China escaping a hard landing,” he added, referring to widespread fears last year that China could slow down sharply as the global turmoil, feeble domestic demand and a weak property market weighed on growth.Stock market investors also welcomed the data. The Shanghai composite index rose 1.4 percent, and in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng climbed 1.1 percent.China’s mild re-acceleration has been helped by a gradual recovery in overseas demand for Chinese-made goods in recent months, as well as a string of economic stimulus measures announced by the government over the course of last year. These have helped put a floor under the beleaguered property market, and ramped up infrastructure construction activity, in particular.The batch of data released by the Chinese statistics bureau on Friday also underlined that China’s once red-hot economy has now settled into a much slower pace of expansion.The head of the statistics authority, Ma Jiantang, acknowledged as much at a press conference in Beijing: “I think you could use these two sentences to give a relatively concise assessment of economic performance in 2012,” he said. “First, national economic performance maintained stability while slowing; second, economic and social development made advances while maintaining stability.”Annual expansion has slowed to around 8 percent — the pace for 2012 was 7.8 percent, down from the 9.3 percent in 2011 and the 10.4 percent in 2010 — and many economists expect a similar or slightly better pace for 2013.Xianfang Ren, an economist at IHS Global Insight in Beijing, commented that Friday’s data confirmed “that the worst is probably over for the economy and that China has avoided a hard landing,” But it was “quite a narrow escape.” The economy will likely be “wiggling within quite a narrow band of growth rates in 2013, as the upside pull only marginally outweighs the downside drag,” Ms. Ren added in an e-mailed note.Many analysts believe that the economy’s momentum may ease again later this year if the government alters policies in a bid to prevent inflation and property prices from heating up again.Regulators also are watching out for potential problems caused by lending activities outside the regulated banking system, which have been an important driver of economic activity.The growth of such non-bank credit, commented Yao Wei, an economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong in a recent research report, “is likely to slow once regulators respond seriously to risks rising from the shadow banking system.” Along with tighter property policies, Ms. Yao said, this factor is likely to cause the recovering momentum to fade late in the second quarter of this year.Longer term, analysts believe the pace is likely to slow even further over the coming decade as the authorities pursue a shift towards higher-quality growth, and grapple with the gradual aging of the country’s population.“China’s working-age population experienced its first absolute decline for some considerable time, and we are certainly taking this issue seriously,” Mr. Ma, the statistics bureau head, said Friday.“For quite some time to come, and at least up until 2030, China’s working-age population aged from 15 to less than 60 years old will, I think, steadily and gradually shrink,” Mr. Ma said. This, he added, meant that it was important for China to raise labor productivity.Chris Buckley contributed reporting."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/business/economy/us-consumer-sentiment-dips.html,"Consumer sentiment in the United States unexpectedly declined in January for a second consecutive month to its lowest point in more than a year, a survey released on Friday showed.Many consumers in the survey cited the recent negotiations in Washington over spending cuts and tax increases, the so-called fiscal cliff debate, for their negative feelings.“The handling of the fiscal cliff talks and the realization that paychecks are going to be smaller due to the sunset of the payroll tax holiday are probably weighing on consumer attitudes at the moment,” said Thomas Simons, a money market economist at Jefferies & Company in New York.While most of the scheduled tax increases and spending cuts were avoided when Congress struck a deal on Jan. 1, the take-home pay of most American workers fell when a 2 percentage-point cut in payroll taxes expired.The Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan’s preliminary reading on the overall index of consumer sentiment came in at 71.3, compared with 72.9 the month before. That was its lowest point since December 2011. It was also below the median forecast of 75 from economists polled by Reuters.“The unique aspect of the early January data was that a record number of consumers — 35 percent — negatively referred to the fiscal cliff negotiations,” Richard Curtin, the survey’s director, said in a statement.“Importantly, the debt ceiling debate is still upcoming and could further weaken confidence,” he said.Congressional Republicans said on Friday that they would agree to raise the federal government’s borrowing limit to pass a budget and to begin talks on long-term deficit reduction."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/business/transcripts-revive-a-tiff-of-two-fed-presidents.html,"As the financial crisis gathered strength in the summer of 2007, two regional Federal Reserve presidents had a curt exchange over whether one of them — Timothy F. Geithner, now the Treasury secretary — might have shared too much information with bankers.And the official who made the assertion, Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, reiterated it on Friday.The original exchange came on a video conference call of Fed policy makers in August 2007, when Mr. Geithner was head of the New York Fed. It came to light on Friday when the Fed released the transcripts of all its deliberations in that year.At issue was whether Mr. Geithner might have alerted Kenneth D. Lewis, then the chief executive of Bank of America, that the Federal Reserve planned to cut the rate it charged banks to borrow at its discount window.Fed officials are not supposed to provide details of monetary policy decisions to market participants before they are made public. Bankers could profit from the information.After Mr. Geithner reported to the group that a range of “market participants” had raised questions about the Fed’s practices on the discount window, he added that “they obviously don’t have any idea that we’re contemplating a change in policy.”Mr. Lacker asked the group if he could follow up, and said: “I spoke with Ken Lewis, president and C.E.O. of Bank of America, this afternoon, and he said that he appreciated what Tim Geithner was arranging by way of changes in the discount facility. So my information is different from that.”Mr. Geithner remained cool and reiterated that he had not shared private information of what the Fed had planned.“Well, I cannot speak for Ken Lewis, but I think they have sought to see whether they could understand a little more clearly the scope of their rights and our current policy with respect to the window,” Mr. Geithner said.Asked to comment on Friday, Mr. Lacker, who continues to head the Richmond Fed, reaffirmed his account. “My understanding was that President Geithner had discussed a reduction in the discount rate with these banks in connection with these initiatives,” he said.A spokesman for Secretary Geithner, Anthony Coley, declined to comment, instead citing Mr. Geithner’s original response in the 2007 exchange. Mr. Lewis, who left Bank of America in 2009, could not be reached for comment.Fed watchers said the dispute bore signs of a turf war between Mr. Geithner and Mr. Lacker. Based in Charlotte, N.C., Bank of America would have been in Mr. Lacker’s domain, as head of the Richmond Fed.On the other hand, as vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee and head of the New York Fed, Mr. Geithner regularly talked to top money-center banks, even if they were not based in Manhattan. Mr. Lacker, analysts suggested, wanted to make it clear that Bank of America was his bailiwick."

Jeffrey R. Immelt, the chief executive, has worked to expand its presence in the energy industry in recent years.The order backlog, watched by investors as an important indicator of future sales growth, hit a record high $210 billion in the fourth quarter, up from $203 billion in the third quarter.“The backlog was a really good number. I didn’t expect to see a $7 billion, 3.5 percent rise in the backlog,” said Jack De Gan, chief investment officer at the Harbor Advisory Corporation, which holds G.E. shares. “Orders in the fourth quarter must have been really good for the industrial side.”Orders rose 2 percent and would have been up 7 percent without a sharp drop in demand for wind turbines tied to the expected expiration of a tax credit.Solid demand in China and other oil-producing countries helped offset unsteady economies at home and in Europe, Mr. Immelt said.“We saw real strength in the emerging markets, and the developed regions stabilized,” Mr. Immelt told investors on a conference call.The company, which is one of the world’s biggest makers of jet engines and electric turbines, said fourth-quarter earnings rose to $4.01 billion, or 38 cents a share, compared with $3.73 billion, or 35 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.Factoring out one-time items, profit was 44 cents a share, a penny ahead of analysts’ estimates, according to Thomson Reuters.Revenue rose 3.6 percent, to $39.33 billion from $37.97 billion a year earlier. Analysts had expected revenue of $38.76 billion.Profit increased across all divisions, with the jet engine unit notching 22 percent growth, and GE Oil and Gas, which makes equipment used in energy production, up 14 percent.Profit at the GE Capital finance arm, which is being scaled back, rose 6 percent.“They saw some good organic growth in the industrial part of their business. GE Capital was a strong contributor,” said Oliver Pursche, president of Gary Goldberg Financial Services, a G.E. shareholder.Over the last few years, G.E. has bolstered its position in the energy industry.It has broadened its lineup of equipment used in oil and gas production and mining, with an eye toward capitalizing on surging natural gas production in the United States. G.E. also makes medical equipment and railroad locomotives.At the same time, Mr. Immelt has concentrated on cutting costs across the company to try to raise operating profit to 15.8 percent of sales by the end of 2013.Shares of G.E., which is based in Fairfield, Conn., rose 74 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $22.04."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/opinion/sunday/check-the-calendar-before-you-buy-that-stock.html,"IN the first three weeks or so of trading this year, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index, a measure of the broad market, has climbed more than 4 percent — and on Jan. 18, in fact, closed at its highest level since December 2007. Last January, the S.&P. 500 rose 4.4 percent — a blistering pace that, if kept up for the rest of 2012, would have translated into a compound annual return of nearly 67 percent. (Alas, it did not.) January 2011 was also a hot one for stocks, its monthly return translating into an annualized gain of 31 percent.Mention such returns to the average Wall Street type and you’re likely to get a yawn. Going back to the 1920s, after all, the first month of the year has, with striking regularity, been a great time to invest — a phenomenon known, fittingly, as “the January Effect.”First discussed in a 1942 article by the investment banker Sidney B. Wachtel, this celebrated winter anomaly has two components: the stock market tends to do well over all in January, and small-company shares typically outperform large stocks. For the rest of the year, the latter trend often reverses, and big stocks beat the small fry.Why exactly the January Effect persists is a mystery — in an efficient market, such calendar-driven bonanzas aren’t supposed to happen.Some believe the phenomenon is a result of tax-loss selling: investors dump their loser stocks in December to recognize a capital loss and then buy them back in January, pushing up share prices. Others say it’s because of institutional money managers, who shed their weakest-performing or riskiest-looking small stocks before Dec. 31 so that their reported year-end holdings look better to clients. Like the tax-loss sellers, these “window dressers” return to buying when the calendar turns anew.But what if the January Effect has a more fundamental cause — one that ties directly to human nature?In a paper published in The Journal of Behavioral Finance in 2011, I proposed that this most famous of regular irregularities in the stock market was attributable to our strong inclination to be optimistic at the turn of the year. Investors, exhibiting the same flash of wishful thinking exuded by any New Year’s resolution maker, take a flier on those little stocks that “have great potential.” Then, as the hopefulness fades over the year, the January could-bes fall back into might-have-beens, typically doing a little worse than the market as a whole.For an experiment that might test this hypothesis, I gathered a portfolio of stocks particularly susceptible to optimism — those for which Wall Street analysts had sharply varying opinions regarding their prospects, with some analysts wildly upbeat in their assessments and others quite pessimistic. I argued that in January, share prices would reflect the optimistic view rather than the gloomy one and that in the rest of the year the opposite would occur — a pattern that monthly stock returns later bore out.What’s more, recent research on the brain suggests that some human beings are hard-wired for such optimism. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging, the neuroscientist Tali Sharot, at University College London, and her team have been studying communication between the brain’s frontal cortex and subcortical regions deep in the brain; inveterate optimists, it seems, tend to have stronger communication links between these areas.Whether or not this brain cross-talk spikes in January is an open question — as is another major piece of the puzzle: Why doesn’t the January Effect disappear in anticipation of the January Effect, as investors try to take advantage of what’s coming? I believe that the “false hope syndrome,” a notion that has been explored by the psychologists Janet Polivy and C. Peter Herman, may account for some of the reason.The theory is that people are optimistic at the turn of the year and often make idealistic resolutions: lose 50 pounds, write that novel, cut down the binge spending or make a windfall in the stock market. As the year progresses, they fall short of their goals and eventually forget or give up. But come next January, the goals are back, starting the cycle of failure and renewed effort all over again.Looking further into brain activity, Dr. Sharot and her team may have found why false hopes exist neurologically. They contend that unrealistic optimism is a pervasive human trait. Evaluating how this optimism is maintained in the face of information that challenges it, they found that desirable information was encoded in a different part of the brain than undesirable information.Optimists and pessimists both process desirable information effectively, but the brain neurons of extreme optimists do not effectively encode undesirable information. This reduced ability to remember disappointments is probably an advantage for many people — like professional athletes, who need confidence after tough losses. But for investors looking for long-term winners at the start of the year, it’s best to give yourself a gut check before you buy."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/business/fed-monetary-policy-drives-best-at-higher-speeds.html,"WITH all the drama about fiscal policy in Congress and at the White House, it’s easy to miss the quiet policy evolution taking place nearby, at the Federal Reserve. The central bank has adopted a more aggressive monetary policy that could be very helpful to the recovering economy. But internal debate at the Fed may weaken the program before it really gets off the ground.First, what has the Fed done recently? Until September, its bond-buying program was explicitly limited in size and duration. Fed policy makers then replaced it with an open-ended program, whose pace was to be determined by progress in healing the labor market. And they adopted simpler, more positive explanations for their actions — jettisoning the gloomy, expectations-killing language that cited wretched economic prospects to justify every expansionary move.Then, in December, the Fed surprised markets by replacing its somewhat confusing predictions for interest rates with numerical guidelines. It said it would keep the rate it controls — the federal funds rate — near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent or inflation rose above 2.5 percent.Under the circumstances, it was significant that the policy makers took these actions at all. The economic data that came out before the September meeting were actually better than expected. And, based on forecasts released after the meeting, members of the Fed’s policy-making committee were slightly more optimistic about prospects for employment and output growth than they had been three months before. That they nevertheless adopted a more expansionary policy can be read as an admission that they hadn’t been doing enough earlier.The pledge to keep rates low, even if inflation edged above 2 percent, is particularly consequential. For the last several years, the Fed has acted as if 2 percent were not just a target but a ceiling that should never be breached. But coming out of a terrible recession, with unemployment excruciatingly high, a period of very rapid growth is needed to repair the damage — and it wouldn’t be surprising for such growth to push inflation a bit over 2 percent. A Fed acknowledgment that 2.5 percent inflation would be tolerable for a short while isn’t a sign that it has lost its commitment to price stability. Instead, it’s a strong statement that it is committed to ensuring a faster recovery.The more positive language, along with the “we’ll do whatever it takes” approach to bond buying, seems designed to reassure Americans that conditions will improve. This, too, is important. With short-term rates close to zero, the Fed’s main tool is expectations management. If it can persuade people to expect more growth — and yes, a little more inflation — it may help encourage companies to stop sitting on cash and start investing again.The new policies are improvements, but I don’t want to oversell them. As I suggested in a previous column, a more definitive policy shift — like adopting a new target for monetary policy — would likely have a greater impact on expectations and in stimulating the recovery.And the new policy’s numerical parameters are too conservative. According to the Fed’s own assessments, normal unemployment over the longer run is well below 6.5 percent. If inflation remains low and unemployment gets down to 6.5 percent, there’s no reason to rush to raise interest rates.The most pressing problem, though, is that the Fed’s commitment to its new policies appears shaky. Soon after the December meeting, some members of the policy-making committee spoke out against the action — killing some of the positive buzz created by the policy statement and by a spirited news conference by the Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke. Also, the minutes of the December meeting showed that some who had voted for the new guidance on the fed funds rate were skeptical about the complementary action on bond-buying.No one of the Fed’s recent actions is particularly powerful on its own, but together they create a sense of aggressive expansion and commitment to recovery. If the Fed now stops some of them, giving the public a mixed message, the positive effect on expectations could easily evaporate.So why has the Fed moved slowly, and why are some policy makers threatening to undo the recent actions? In a recent paper, Prof. David Romer of the University of California, Berkeley (my husband), and I found that pessimistic views about the effectiveness and costs of expansionary actions have played a major role in limiting Fed moves over the last few years. Policy makers worry that such actions will do little good and that they could cause inflation, distortions in financial markets and losses on the Fed’s portfolio.I can’t say for sure that those views are wrong today. We just don’t have enough experience with situations like the current one to have conclusive evidence one way or the other.But our paper shows that in two periods when the Fed made terrible errors, the same kinds of pessimistic views were present. Faced with the Great Depression of the early 1930s and the high inflation of the early and late 1970s, monetary policy makers did little because they were convinced that action would be ineffective.Subsequent events proved both decisions wrong. In the 1930s, a propitious gold inflow allowed the administration of Franklin D. Roosevelt to conduct monetary expansion without the Fed. Real interest rates plummeted, expectations improved and investment spending and consumer purchases of durable goods took off — jump-starting the recovery. At the end of the 1970s, a new Fed chairman, Paul A. Volcker, concluded that monetary policy absolutely could reduce inflation, and he led the Fed to raise interest rates to historic highs. The recession that followed was painful, but inflation did come down — and it has been low ever since.WHEN monetary policy makers meet again at the end of this month, they should keep these historical lessons in mind. At the very least, the Cassandras on the committee might want to reread the policy record from the 1930s. The degree to which some of them sound like their Depression-era counterparts might shock them — and give them pause.The Fed’s new more aggressive policy shows every sign of being helpful, and there are no indications that the feared costs are materializing. So rather than trimming the policy before it can bear fruit, why not give it a chance?Even better, why not give it some extra oomph? Rather than just continuing the bond-buying program, accelerate it somewhat. Instead of just reiterating the numerical guidelines on the funds rate, policy makers could follow the suggestion of Narayana Kocherlakota,  the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, that they lower to 5.5 percent the unemployment level at which the Fed starts to consider raising interest rates. And if Mr. Bernanke wanted to be truly aggressive, he could broach the idea that in a weak economy, a strong dollar isn’t necessarily desirable.The important thing is that hypothetical fears shouldn’t stop the Fed’s evolution. History is on the side of doing more, not standing on the sidelines."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/business/a-fed-voice-asking-to-cut-megabanks-down-to-size.html,"IT is a prevailing myth in Washington: big bailouts are over for good. Never again, the line goes, could giant financial institutions imperil the nation’s economy.This is nonsense, of course. Whatever regulators and lawmakers say, the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul lacks any guarantee that taxpayers won’t have to come to the rescue again.So it was refreshing to hear a Federal Reserve System official debunk the bailouts-are-gone theory last week.The official was Richard W. Fisher, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and a longstanding truth-teller about too-big-to-fail banks. On Wednesday, in a speech in Washington, Mr. Fisher laid out a compelling proposal for shrinking financial giants in order to protect taxpayers. He suggested that megabanks be chopped into pieces, so that no one of them could endanger the financial system if it ran into trouble.That may sound like a return to the Glass-Steagall Act, the Depression-era law that separated investment banking and commercial banking until it was dismantled in 1999. But Mr. Fisher’s plan is more sophisticated than Glass-Steagall, in that it recognizes how complex big financial institutions have become. Glass-Steagall concerned only old-school banking businesses, like making loans, and Wall Street businesses, like trading stocks. Today’s financial behemoths are in so many different businesses that a top-to-bottom restructuring is required.Why? Mr. Fisher argued that megabanks not only threaten taxpayers with bailouts, but that their continuing failure to lend is also thwarting the Fed’s efforts to jump-start the economy by keeping interest rates low. “I submit that these institutions, as a result of their privileged status, exact an unfair tax upon the American people,” he told his audience. “Moreover, they interfere with the transmission of monetary policy and inhibit the advancement of our nation’s economic prosperity.”Smaller institutions, by contrast, have continued to lend in the post-crisis years, especially to the kinds of modest-size businesses that create so many jobs across the country. According to figures compiled by Mr. Fisher’s colleagues at the Dallas Fed, community banks — defined as those with no more than $10 billion in assets — hold less than one-fifth of the nation’s banking assets. Nevertheless, they hold more than half of the industry’s small-business loans.Huge banks must be restructured and their access to the safety net scaled back, Mr. Fisher said, because neither regulators nor market participants have proved effective in monitoring risks at these institutions.The manic years before the credit crisis proved that regulators can’t police financial institutions appropriately. And while market discipline has worked to keep smaller institutions on the straight and narrow, it has been ineffective with megabanks, Mr. Fisher said. He noted, for example, that community banks typically have a few large shareholders scrutinizing the risks in their operations. But too-big-to-fail institutions, with millions of disparate shareholders, don’t benefit from this kind of concentrated policing mechanism.Big banks’ creditors — like bond holders — don’t impose discipline, either. They know they will be protected by a taxpayer rescue should a large institution teeter.Fairness is at the heart of Mr. Fisher’s argument. Large institutions, he said, are “financial firms whose owners, managers and customers believe themselves to be exempt from the processes of bankruptcy and creative destruction.” In other words, small institutions must submit to the rigors of the free market. Those too big to fail do not.There are roughly 5,600 commercial banking institutions in the country, Mr. Fisher noted. Some 5,500 of them are community banks. While these organizations account for 98.6 percent of all banks, they hold only 12 percent of total industry assets. They are routinely allowed to fail if they get into trouble. Few of them did during the crisis.Contrast these figures with those of the nation’s 12 largest banks, whose assets range from $250 billion to $2.3 trillion. They account for 0.2 percent of all banks but hold 69 percent of industry assets. These are the banks that enjoy all the perquisites of the federal safety net: significantly lower borrowing costs and a taxpayer backstop, for example.Understanding that it will be a tough battle to break up the megabanks, Mr. Fisher suggests that in the meantime, only commercial banking operations receive protection from the federal safety net in the form of federal deposit insurance. An institution’s other activities — securities trading, insurance operations and real estate, for example — should fall outside any backstop. Furthermore, he recommends that these banks require customers and trading partners to sign an agreement stating that they understand the business they are conducting is not covered by any federal protection or guarantees. That would begin to reduce the perception that all of these institutions’ counterparties would be protected in a disaster.“Financial stability rests on a level playing field that rewards sound judgment and integrity and penalizes excessive risk and complexity financed by taxpayer dollars,” Mr. Fisher said in his speech. “Government must retain its role as the financial system’s watchdog, but it should render no institution immune to market discipline.”IN an interview after the speech, Mr. Fisher said he believed his plan could appeal to both liberals and conservatives. “It’s politically palatable on both sides of the aisle,” he said. “This is one thing that both Republicans and Democrats can agree on.”Or, as he said more pointedly in his speech: “If the administration and the Congress could agree as recently as two weeks ago on legislation that affects 1 percent of taxpayers, surely it can process a solution that affects 0.2 percent of the nation’s banks and is less complex and far more effective than Dodd-Frank.”The response to Mr. Fisher’s proposal has been resoundingly positive, he said. Immediately after the speech was posted Wednesday evening on the Dallas Fed’s Web site, heavy traffic caused the site to shut down.“I do think that this is something that can actually bring people on Capitol Hill together,” he said.Wouldn’t that be nice?"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/business/jeffrey-sprechers-improbable-path-to-buying-the-nyse.html,"WHEN nearly all else had failed, Jeffrey C. Sprecher flew to New York City and crashed at his sisters’ apartment, a cramped walk-up on the Upper West Side, one flight above a noisy bar.It was January 2000, and Mr. Sprecher had been cold-calling Wall Street for weeks. He was searching desperately for someone to back his small company in Atlanta, a business that was eating up his money and years of his life.That’s when a black limousine pulled up in front of the bar, Jake’s Dilemma. The limo had been sent by the mighty Goldman Sachs to fetch Mr. Sprecher, and as he sank into the back seat that winter day, he set off on an improbable journey that has since taken him to the pinnacle of American finance.Today Mr. Sprecher, a man virtually unknown outside of financial circles, is poised to buy the New York Stock Exchange. Not one of the 2,300 or so stocks traded on the New York Stock Exchange (combined value of those shares: about $20.1 trillion). No, Jeff Sprecher is buying the entire New York Stock Exchange.It sounds preposterous. A businessman from Atlanta blows into New York and walks off with the colonnaded high temple of American capitalism. But if all goes according to plan, his $8.2 billion acquisition, announced a few days before Christmas, will close later this year. And with that, 221 years of Wall Street history will come to an end. No more will New York be the master of the New York Stock Exchange. Instead, from its bland headquarters 750 miles from Wall Street, Mr. Sprecher’s young company, IntercontinentalExchange, will run the largest stock exchange in the nation and the world.Mr. Sprecher, 57, certainly plays the role of a wily upstart. He may wear power suits and a Patek Philippe watch, but he comes across as unusually casual and self-deprecating for a man in his position. He pokes fun at himself for his shortcomings — “I don’t know how to manage people,” he says — and his love of obscure documentaries.How the New York Stock Exchange fell into Mr. Sprecher’s hands is, at heart, a story of the disruptive power of innovation. ICE, as IntercontinentalExchange is known, did not even exist 13 years ago. It has no cavernous trading floor, no gilded halls, no sweaty brokers braying for money on the financial markets. What it has is technology.Like many young companies that are upending the old order in business, ICE has used computer power to do things faster and cheaper, if not always better, than people can. Its rapid ascent reflects a new Wall Street where high-speed computers now dominate trading, sometimes with alarming consequences. New, electronic trading systems have greatly reduced the cost of buying and selling stocks, thus saving mutual funds — and, by extension, ordinary investors — countless millions. But they have also helped usher in a period of hair-raising volatility.Mr. Sprecher (pronounced SPRECK-er) has probably done more than anyone else to dismantle the trading floors of old and replace human brokers with machines. Along the way, he and ICE have traced an arc through some of the defining business stories of our time — from the rise and fall of Enron, to the transformation of old-school investment banks into vast trading operations, to the Wall Street excesses that not long ago helped derail the entire economy. Now, after a series of bold acquisitions, he is about to become the big boss of the Big Board.Does it really matter who owns the New York Stock Exchange and its parent company, NYSE Euronext? For most people, stock exchanges are probably a bit like plumbing. Most of us don’t think much about them — until something goes wrong. But lately, some things have gone spectacularly wrong.One sign of trouble came in 2010, when an errant trade ricocheted through computer networks and touched off one of the most harrowing moments in stock market history. The Dow Jones industrial average plunged 900 points in a matter of minutes, and a new phrase entered the lexicon: flash crash.Since then, flash crashes in individual stocks have been remarkably common, as the centuries-old system of central exchanges has given way to a field of competing electronic systems.ICE wasn’t involved in any of these problems. In fact, it has been praised as one of the first exchanges to put limits on lightning-quick, high-frequency trading. This points to Mr. Sprecher’s deftness in piloting his company through periods of regulation, deregulation and now re-regulation.While many banking executives have clashed with Washington, Mr. Sprecher has sensed the changing winds and tacked accordingly. He also stays close — some say too close — to the powerful Wall Street firms that are his customers.It is perhaps unsurprising that some of the people who make their living on the Big Board’s floor are a bit nervous about the exchange’s new boss. But Mr. Sprecher says they have nothing to fear. His friends and business associates say he could actually turn out to be the best hope for restoring trust in the stock market. After all, he has beaten the odds before.“There were a number of times when the odds were long, but he wasn’t deterred from stepping in,” says James Newsome, who was Mr. Sprecher’s regulator at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission before becoming his competitor as chief executive of the New York Mercantile Exchange. “A lot of people, if they don’t think they will win, they won’t participate. Jeff doesn’t operate like that.”For now, Mr. Sprecher is still spending much of his time at ICE’s headquarters in suburban Atlanta. The contrast with the New York Stock Exchange is striking. Behind its neoclassical face, the Big Board is a sprawling labyrinth of historic oil paintings, gilded leather chairs, stained wood and elegant dining rooms — all set amid crowds of gawking tourists.ICE, meanwhile, occupies a few floors of an anodyne black-glass cube surrounded by trees and parking lots. The employees share their cafeteria with the building’s other tenants. The walls are lined with dry-erase boards.On a recent weekday, the whiteboard in Mr. Sprecher’s modest corner office was filled with columns of scribbled numbers. They were leftovers from the all-night sessions that led to the deal for the Big Board.One column was labeled “Yankees,” ICE’s code name for the New York Stock Exchange. Another was labeled “Braves,” a shorthand for ICE. On the margins was a doodle of a tree with a cat hanging from one of the branches, in a hang-in-there-baby vein. It was done, Mr. Sprecher says, by his wife, Kelly Loeffler, who also happens to be his director of investor relations.“This negotiation had fits and starts,” Mr. Sprecher says. “There were days when we just wanted to throw each other out of the window.”But Mr. Sprecher didn’t blink, not even at the billions of dollars lined up under the Yankees column.“It’s not about the value of what you paid for, because you are going to change the underlying business to begin with,” he says. “You acquire companies at moments in time when there’s an inflection point and you can change the trajectory of the company and the industry.”THE New York taxi driver asked: “What brings you to this concrete hellhole?”He was talking to Mr. Sprecher, then a young man visiting New York for the first time from his home in Wisconsin.“I was terrified,” Mr. Sprecher recalls of that visit, in the 1970s.At the time, Mr. Sprecher was still a small-town kid, the son of an insurance salesman and a medical technician in Madison, Wis. It was decades before ICE existed, before it owned exchanges on three continents and before it became a venue to trade everything from Midwestern wheat to Brazilian coffee to Scandinavian oil.Back then, he stayed with his sister Jill Sprecher, who had come to New York to study filmmaking. According to her, Mr. Sprecher was the archetype of the older brother: confident, competent and protective, the type whom all the teachers remember and judge younger siblings against. His most distinguishing trait was his knack for taking things apart and putting them back together — and for making money.“Everything he touched always made money, where everything I touched lost money,” says Ms. Sprecher, who writes and directs independent films with their sister, Karen.But not even Jill Sprecher would have guessed that her brother would one day stand atop the New York Stock Exchange.“What has happened to him since 2000 is beyond my comprehension,” she says.Mr. Sprecher’s first job after college was as a salesman for the industrial company Trane, a job he says he got thanks to good grades and a reputation for being the life of the party at Sigma Alpha Epsilon. He accepted the job because it took him to Southern California.“It was the ticket to the beach and palm trees and girls on roller skates, and I was like, ‘That’s what I want to do in life,’ ” he recalls.While at Trane, he made an early sales pitch to William Prentice, an entrepreneur who was developing power plants. It was 1983, and the nation’s electricity market had just been deregulated, allowing entrepreneurs to start their own power plants, which only utilities had been allowed to do in the past. Mr. Prentice, impressed that Mr. Sprecher recognized the industry was in the middle of big changes, almost immediately offered him a job at his new company, the Western Power Group.“He had already internalized the whole concept of creative destruction,” Mr. Prentice says.Western Power got off to a rocky start. It almost failed when a Canadian company threatened to corner its local energy supply: cow manure. Others at the Western Power Group grew despondent. Mr. Sprecher and Mr. Prentice spent weeks in a motel in California’s Imperial Valley, trying to persuade the suppliers to change their minds.“We called it ‘the manure wars,’ ” Mr. Prentice says. “Neither myself nor Jeff questioned the need to go and fight. There was never any second-guessing — it was just go do it and win.”Win they did. After Mr. Prentice sold his stake in the company a few years later, Mr. Sprecher continued building the Western Power Group until another round of electricity deregulation occurred in 1996. Then he pounced.Previously, power plant owners who wanted to buy and sell surplus electricity had to call one another and agree on a price. Mr. Sprecher saw opportunity in an Atlanta company that provided an electronic trading network. He bought that company, the Continental Power Exchange, with his own money; he ended up putting $4 million into it.Although Mr. Sprecher kept his company in California and his house in Beverly Hills, he spent every spare hour trying aggressively to sign up utility companies for the Atlanta exchange. His team made many visits to Enron, where they met with top executives like Jeffrey Skilling, who is now serving time in prison. Those meetings ended one day when the Enron executives began asking a number of technical questions about Mr. Sprecher’s system.“We sat there in the meeting and we realized, these guys are building this themselves, and we are educating them,” Mr. Sprecher recalls.Shortly thereafter, Enron started its own electricity trading platform, which quickly came to dominate the industry. It looked as if the Continental Power Exchange was done. But Enron made one big mistake. Rather than providing a place for buyers and sellers to meet, Enron itself bought from every seller and sold to every buyer.This angered Wall Street banks that were among the biggest traders of energy products. When Mr. Sprecher showed up in New York to stay with his two sisters in 2000, nearly ready to give up on his own system, he didn’t know that Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs had been looking for someone just like him, who could provide an alternative to Enron.As Mr. Sprecher shuttled between meetings at the two banks, the bankers were trading phone calls and buzzing.“We were all thinking, ‘This is the guy we want,’ ” recalls John A. Shapiro, who was involved in the talks at Morgan Stanley. “We had already talked to a number of people, and the difference was night and day.”The difference wasn’t the Atlanta exchange’s technology, say people who were involved. It was Mr. Sprecher himself.“At some point, you said: ‘O.K., this guy has got something going for him. Maybe it’s hard to put your finger on it. But you know it when you see it,’ ” Mr. Shapiro recalls.On the other side, it was the perfect time to be hooking up with Wall Street, as banks were focusing increasingly on trading. In the negotiations that followed, Mr. Sprecher used what would become a trademark strategy: giving up part of the ownership of his company in exchange for a promise that the recipients would use his platform. In this case, he gave up 80 percent of the ownership to the two banks. The banks soon turned around and gave part of their own stakes to several of the largest power companies, including Shell, Total and British Petroleum, which committed to using what was soon rechristened as IntercontinentalExchange.When Enron collapsed in scandal, the business began pouring in.BY their own account, Mr. Sprecher and his wife, Ms. Loeffler, live for ICE. He has some hobbies, and his sister Jill wonders how he finds the time to watch cooking shows and reality television. But he and his wife have no children. Ms. Loeffler, the more serious of the two, says the thing that brought them together was their willingness, and desire, to do their jobs around the clock.“We both just work all the time and enjoy work,” Ms. Loeffler says.Both revel in the brinkmanship that has marked ICE’s climb. Two days before Mr. Sprecher and his Wall Street backers announced the creation of ICE in 2000, they offered the New York Mercantile Exchange, or Nymex, a 10 percent stake in the new business if Nymex would share some of its back-office services.While Mr. Sprecher was giving his presentation to the board, a director said, “Who the hell brought this guy into our board meeting?”Mr. Sprecher recalled, “Then the room went silent.” The next thing he knew, a guard was escorting him out of the building.ICE was confronting a trading world that had ossified into an almost ritualistic society. The exchanges were owned by their traders, who made the rules. The traders themselves were rough-and-tumble men who used their fists as computers. From the beginning of ICE, Mr. Sprecher was seen by the old-time traders as a tool of Wall Street banks that wanted to supplant local traders at the exchanges — a reputation he has never managed to shake fully.For his part, Mr. Sprecher rarely showed deference to traditional powers.When Nymex was bidding for the International Petroleum Exchange in London in 2001, ICE doubled Nymex’s offer and won. Within a few years, ICE had shut down the historic trading pits at the London exchange in favor of computerized trading.Next up in 2006 was the New York Board of Trade, where financial contracts tied to agricultural products like sugar and cocoa were bought and sold. Mr. Sprecher says people looked askance at him when he offered a billion dollars for it. “I really believed there was a fundamental change going on in the globalization of commodities,” he says.People involved in the deal say Mr. Sprecher was initially attentive to the concerns of the floor traders.“He had the capability to disarm people — you might even say charm people — into accepting his soft-spoken demeanor,” says Frederick W. Schoenhut, who was the chairman of the New York Board of Trade.But as soon as the deal went through, Mr. Sprecher was seldom seen. What’s more, he put a manager in his 30s in charge of the New York operations. Mr. Sprecher says that was intentional.“I wanted to show that market that there was a much younger, aggressive guy here who really wanted to fundamentally change that company,” he says.ICE didn’t have to do much to initiate that change. It allowed customers to choose between trading on the floor or on ICE’s electronic system. Within months, most customers had migrated to the screen. The situation caused so much job loss and unhappiness that when ICE made its next takeover bid, for the Chicago Board of Trade, a crew of New York Board of Trade traders took out newspaper ads warning the Chicago traders to “watch their backs.” ICE ultimately lost that battle, but only after almost derailing a rival bid by slipping an offer under a hotel room door.ICE also attracted the ire of a number of Democratic senators, who said it was encouraging speculation that caused fluctuations in the price of essential commodities like oil. But Mr. Sprecher proved adept at defanging his political opponents by bending to their will.“Tell me what the rules are and I’ll figure out how we can make money around them,” is one of his common lines when talking to regulators in Washington.Since the financial crisis, Mr. Sprecher has used that attitude to position himself to take advantage of changes being brought by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul. Soon, Wall Street firms will have to move trading in many opaque financial products to exchanges, and ICE is in a perfect position to profit.THE clear attraction of the deal for NYSE Euronext is that it will create a global force in futures trading, an area set to benefit from Dodd-Frank reforms. In the United States, ICE is now the second-most-important futures trading company, after the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. NYSE Euronext owns one of the most important futures exchanges in Europe.The future of the New York Stock Exchange, on the other hand, is less clear. For someone who is buying a stock exchange, Mr. Sprecher is very critical of the state of stock markets.“There are so many places where you say, fundamentally something does not feel good to the average investor on what used to be the greatest capital markets in the world,” he says. But all of this is what makes stock trading an attractive industry for him — it is one that is ripe for change. He is already speaking out about a need to reform the rules governing stock markets.At the exchange itself last Wednesday, the 900-some men and women who work on the Big Board’s floor filed through the doors at 11 Wall Street in trading jackets of blue, red and green. Over the years, their number has dwindled steadily as computerized trading put many out of work.Even before ICE swooped in, some wondered how long the Big Board’s floor, the scene of so many triumphs and failures, could endure.Mr. Sprecher says the floor will survive. The American stock market, and the nation, need it.“The pendulum of electronification of markets went too far in the case of U.S. equities — to the point that people want to know there’s a human being watching over their trades,” he says.But that’s now. And Jeff Sprecher hasn’t gotten to where he is by keeping things as they are."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/jobs/matthew-may-on-the-art-of-adding-by-taking-away.html,"NORMALLY I have more ideas than I know what to do with. Several years ago, however, I ran out of them.At the time, I was working closely with the senior leadership of a very large and successful Japanese company. I had been hired to help it develop new ideas and strategies in the United States, but was struggling with a particularly difficult project that required me to reconcile two completely different perspectives. (Eastern and Western ways of thinking are often at odds with each other.) I found myself at a standstill.I must not have done a very good job of hiding how useless I was feeling, because a 2,500-year-old snippet of Chinese philosophy found its way to me anonymously, via a handwritten note on a Post-it stuck to my work space.“To attain knowledge, add things every day. To attain wisdom, subtract things every day,” it said, capsulizing teachings of Lao Tzu. “Profit comes from what is there, usefulness from what is not there.”My first thought was, “Someone wants me gone — I’d be more useful that way.” But as I read it again and thought about it, lightning struck.It dawned on me that I’d been looking at my problem in the wrong way. As is natural and intuitive, I had been looking at what to do, rather than what not to do. But as soon as I shifted my perspective, I was able to complete the project successfully.Even though the idea of subtracting things every day was thousands of years old, it was still radical to me. I decided to explore the idea further.I discovered an essay by the management educator Jim Collins, in which he confirmed the ancient philosophy: “A great piece of art is composed not just of what is in the final piece, but equally important, what is not. It is the discipline to discard what does not fit — to cut out what might have already cost days or even years of effort — that distinguishes the truly exceptional artist and marks the ideal piece of work, be it a symphony, a novel, a painting, a company or, most important of all, a life.”In reading several articles in scientific literature, I discovered that subtraction lights up a brain scan differently than addition does, because it uses different circuitry. In fact, accident victims suffering brain injuries often lose their ability to both add and subtract, retaining only one of the two. Subtraction is literally a different way of thinking.While it hadn’t occurred to me to use subtraction in my own job, I realized that it is at the root of many professions. Scientists, mathematicians and engineers search for theories that explain highly complex phenomena in stunningly simple ways. Musicians and composers use pauses in the music — silence — to create dramatic tension. Athletes and dancers search for maximum impact with minimal effort. Filmmakers, novelists and songwriters strive to tell simple stories that foster both multiple meanings and universal resonance.The principle of subtraction carries over to the corporate world. Here are some examples: W. L. Gore, recognized as one of the world’s most innovative companies, eliminated job titles in order to release employees’ creativity. When it started out, Scion, the youth-oriented unit of Toyota, decided not to advertise, and it reduced the number of standard features on its vehicles to allow buyers to customize their cars. The British bank First Direct operates successfully without branches, relying instead on Internet, telephone and mobile transactions. Steve Jobs revolutionized the world’s concept of a cellphone by removing the physical keyboard from the iPhone. Instagram, acquired last year by Facebook, grew quickly once its first version, called Burbn, was stripped of many of its features and reworked to focus on one thing: photos.THINK about what you could do — or rather not do — in your own life that would put these principles into play. There are two easy ways to begin subtracting things every day:First, create a “not to do” list to accompany your to-do list. Give careful thought to prioritizing your goals, projects and tasks, then eliminate the bottom 20 percent of the list — forever.Second, ask those who matter to you most — clients, colleagues, family members and friends — what they would like you to stop doing. Warning: you may be surprised at just how long the list is.The lesson I’ve learned from my pursuit of less is powerful in its simplicity: when you remove just the right things in just the right way, something good happens."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/business/the-debt-ceiling-and-beyond.html,"To the Editor:In “Above the Debt Ceiling, Boehner Might Find a Blue Sky,” (Economic View, Jan. 13), Richard H. Thaler may have the right practical idea about eliminating the debt ceiling, but I don’t see how uncapping the debt and encouraging more borrowing will “likely restore our triple-A credit rating.” As I see it, that will happen only if we take real steps to rein in spending.Unfortunately, neither party is really interested in cutting spending, because spending is what gets our politicians elected. Democrats like to tax and spend. Republicans like to borrow and spend. We might as well start adjusting our expectations to the likelihood that this year’s fiscal discussions will result in more taxes and more borrowing (with or without a permanent abolition of the debt ceiling) but few if any net spending cuts. That leaves us vulnerable to another ratings downgrade and higher borrowing costs.Fortunately, interest expense isn’t the budget buster here; it’s entitlements, which consume such a massive and growing share of tax revenue. We still have time to reform them, but if we don’t use the time wisely, our children will do it for us. Washington budget drama about anything else, meanwhile, is a waste of time.DANIEL J. ARBESSManhattan, Jan. 13* To the Editor:The debt-ceiling issue is not about the government stopping paying its existing bills and defaulting on its existing debts — it is about whether the government will continue on its current path of increasing its debts through spending more than the taxes it receives.While it is true that Congress passed all the laws that led to the current level of taxes and spending and the resulting deficit, Congress did this is a piecemeal way, tax by tax, appropriation by appropriation and entitlement by entitlement. The debt-ceiling debate offers a rare time to focus on the federal government’s overall financial position.JAMES G. RUSSELLBellaire, Tex., Jan. 13"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/nyregion/truffles-on-china-at-lic-market-for-a-father-daughter-date.html,"In the shadow of the shimmering Citigroup tower in Long Island City, Queens, number crunchers, artists and city employees duck into LIC Market for a casual meal. Last week an exotic guest — black truffles — shared menu space at the two-year-old restaurant with favorites like the slow-cooked pork sandwich ($8) and roasted tomato soup ($5). The Italian truffles run Alex Schindler, the chef and owner, $830 a pound, he said, but he buys only four or five ounces at a time — enough for about three days of specials, the star ingredient drowning neither the dish nor the wallet. And though certain Manhattan restaurants present their truffled entrees on golden plates that diners can take home, Mr. Schindler takes a more bourgeois approach: basic white china stock from Fishs Eddy. He puts the plates in the dishwasher after his patrons have eaten them clean. IN THE SEATS Gerhard Dobler, 58, a senior risk manager at Citibank, and his daughter, Meredith Dobler, 24, who earned her master’s degree in education and lives at home in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., while looking for a teaching job.WHY THEY CAME For the truffles. And for a rare father-daughter lunch. Mr. Dobler eats food from LIC Market nearly three times a week, but he usually takes it to his desk. Both food enthusiasts, they enjoyed the restaurant’s four-course $80 Trufflemania dinner in November. They made a date as soon as Mr. Dobler learned the truffles were back in town.ON THE PLATES Black truffle risotto, with Grana Padano, parsley and shaved truffle ($28); and black truffle fettuccine, butter, chives and shaved truffle ($28). The Doblers were among many in the quaintly cramped 14-table dining room ordering the week’s specials. “The risotto was just the right texture. It wasn’t mushy, not too hard,” Mr. Dobler said. “And then, with the aroma from the black truffles, you get all the senses bonding together.” Ms. Dobler said she enjoyed the simple preparation of the fettuccine: “There are not a lot of ingredients and they are not really fighting each other.” Too full for dessert, they ordered coffee ($2 each for brewed coffee and a decaf Americano).WHAT THEY TALKED ABOUT Truffles again. They evaluated their food with unpretentious precision, switching plates more than midway through the meal. They were thrilled that the lunch lived up to expectations. Future meals were also discussed: They decided their weekend menu would include beef with broccoli stir-fry with oyster sauce and a variety of mushrooms. Mr. Dobler promised to soon make his daughter’s favorite, beef Bourguignon. The conversation veered toward the inevitable: Ms. Dobler’s job search. Mr. Dobler offered networking suggestions and encouragement. “He told me to keep trying, don’t give up, even if you don’t get an interview right away,” Ms. Dobler said. She acknowledged that it would be hard to afford truffles on a teacher’s salary, adding sweetly, “That’s why I have my dad.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/world/africa/sudan-and-south-sudan-fail-to-reach-a-deal-on-oil-and-border-security.html,"JUBA, South Sudan (AP) — South Sudan and Sudan have failed to reach an agreement on how to carry out security arrangements and resume oil exports, officials said Saturday after several days of talks.The two sides were in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia’s capital, to talk about setting up a safe demilitarized border zone, which would require both South Sudan and Sudan to withdraw their armies at least six miles from the contested border region.South Sudan broke away from Sudan in 2011, but disputes remain over their common border and the sharing of oil revenues.A major sticking point has been the demilitarization of a contested 14-mile strip of land bordering the Darfur region in Sudan and the Bahr el-Ghazal region in South Sudan.“Each government has its own understanding of the scope of the 14-mile area,” South Sudan’s negotiating team said in a statement, which goes on to call Sudan’s position “intractable.”Last week, members of South Sudan’s negotiating team claimed that their country had taken a step toward carrying out the border security agreements by withdrawing its own forces from the disputed border.But South Sudan’s military spokesman, Col. Philip Aguer, said no such withdrawal had taken place.Colonel Aguer said that as of Friday, South Sudan’s military had not received an order for the withdrawal of its troops.“The negotiation is at the political level,” he said. “We are at the operation level. So far nothing has reached” the military’s general headquarters.The demilitarized border is the first in a series of steps needed to ensure the resumption of South Sudan’s oil production and export through pipelines in Sudan. South Sudan shut down its production last January after accusing Sudan of stealing its oil before it reached export facilities in Port Sudan, on the Red Sea. The shutdown eventually led to open clashes between the armies of the two countries.In September, the two sides signed an agreement on border security and oil production that was expected to end their disputes. But both sides have been unable to carry out the agreements they previously signed. The presidents of the two countries met early this month and again pledged to carry out the terms of the September deal; the latest round of talks started on Jan. 14.According to the statement from the South Sudan negotiating team, Sudan has refused to export southern oil until the border security arrangements are fully put in effect. This includes the deployment of more than 800 Ethiopian soldiers along the border to monitor the agreement.Sudan has also accused South Sudan of supporting rebels in the Sudanese states of South Kordofan and Blue Nile. The rebel groups were part of South Sudan’s army during the 21-year civil war between the two sides."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/jobs/new-leaders-inc-ceo-on-giving-children-a-chance.html,"I AM the youngest of 10 children in my family, and the only one born in the United States. My father was a municipal judge who fled Haiti during the Duvalier regime. He and my mother settled in the Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn, but could not initially afford to bring over my four brothers and five sisters, who stayed in Haiti with relatives.Since he did not speak English fluently, my father worked as a janitor and had a second job as a hospital security guard. He later took a third job driving a taxi at night to pay for my tuition at Nazareth Regional High School, a Roman Catholic school in Brooklyn. My parents were determined that I was going to get a good education, and wanted to keep me away from local troubles, which did claim two of my childhood friends.Working so many jobs overwhelmed my father. He had a heart attack and died at age 59 behind the wheel of his taxi. My mother found it difficult to cope without my father and moved back to Haiti in 1989 with two of my siblings. I thought I would have to leave school because I had no money for tuition, but Nazareth agreed to pay my way.I wound up sleeping in my car for almost three months, showering at school after my track team’s practice. I also held down two jobs, both in retailing, and one of my sisters and I rented a basement apartment in East Flatbush.After graduating from high school in 1990, I attended St. Francis College in Brooklyn, on athletic and academic scholarships. I worked first at the New York City Board of Education, where H. Carl McCall was president, then in his office after he became New York State comptroller. I later worked in the office of Ruth Messinger, then the Manhattan borough president.I broadened my nonprofit organization experience at the Faith Center for Community Development while earning my master’s of public administration at New York University. I married my high school sweetheart, Melissa, and we now have two children.In 2001, I began to work toward my original goal — improving educational opportunities for children — and joined the city’s Department of Education. I was later recruited under the new administration of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to help start a program as part of his Children First reforms.In 2003, I became the Department of Education’s executive director for parent and community engagement, and, two years later, senior counselor to Joel I. Klein, then the school chancellor. He taught me a great deal about leadership and how to change the education system. But I began to realize public education could not be transformed without great principals who function like C.E.O.’s of their schools.So in 2006 I returned to the nonprofit world, to New Leaders, a national organization founded in 2000 to recruit and develop leaders to turn around low-performing public schools. Initially, I managed city partnerships and expanded our program in areas like New Orleans and Charlotte, N.C.In 2011, I became C.E.O., and revamped our program to produce even stronger student achievement results, streamlined our costs, diversified funding sources and forged new partnerships. We have an annual budget of $31.5 million, which comes from foundations, businesses, individuals and government grants, and a staff of about 200 people at a dozen locations.We have a new partnership with Pearson Education to provide greater learning opportunities to public school principals. The goal of these efforts is to have a great principal in each of our nation’s public schools — to make sure that, just as I did, all kids get a chance at success."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/opinion/sunday/financial-collapse-a-10-step-recovery-plan.html,"HEGEL once wrote, “What experience and history teaches us is that people and governments have never learned anything from history.” Actually, I think people do learn. The problem is that they forget — sometimes amazingly quickly. That seems to be happening today, even though recovery from the economic debacle of 2008-9 is far from complete.Evidence of this forgetting is everywhere. The public has lost interest in the causes of the crisis; many, of course, are just struggling to get by. Unrepentant financiers whine about “excessive” regulation and pay lobbyists to battle every step toward reform. Conservatives bemoan “big government” and yearn to return to laissez-faire deregulation. Higher international standards for bank capital and liquidity have been delayed. I could go on.Instead, let me try to encapsulate what we must remember about the financial crisis into 10 financial commandments, all of which were brazenly violated in the years leading up to the crisis.1. Remember That People ForgetTreasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner lamented last year that before the crisis, “There was no memory of extreme crisis, no memory of what can happen when a nation allows huge amounts of risk to build up.” He was right. As the renegade economist Hyman Minsky knew, it is normal for speculative markets to go to extremes. A key reason, Minsky believed, is that, unlike elephants, people forget. When the good times roll, investors expect them to roll indefinitely. When bubbles burst, they are always surprised.2. Do Not Rely on Self-RegulationSelf-regulation of financial markets is a cruel oxymoron. We need zookeepers to watch over the animals. The government must not outsource this function to “market discipline” (another oxymoron) or to for-profit companies like credit-rating agencies. The Dodd-Frank Act of 2010 isn’t perfect, but it has the potential to change regulation for the better. But most of its reforms are still being phased in, and as the rules are being drafted, the industry (here and abroad) is fighting them tooth and nail and often prevailing.3. Honor Thy ShareholdersBoards of public corporations are supposed to protect the interests of shareholders, partly by monitoring the behavior of top executives, who are employees, not emperors. In the years before the crisis, too many directors forgot those responsibilities, and both their companies and the broader public suffered from the malign neglect. Will they now remember? Some will — for a while. But sanctions on directors for poor performance are minimal.4. Elevate Risk ManagementOne bitter lesson of the crisis is that, when it comes to risk taking, what you don’t know can hurt you. Too many C.E.O.’s let their subordinates ride roughshod over risk managers, tipping the balance toward greed and away from fear. The primary responsibility for keeping risk-management systems up to snuff rests with top executives and boards of directors. But the Federal Reserve and other regulators are now watching and mustn’t let up.5. Use Less LeverageExcessive leverage — otherwise known as over-borrowing — was one of the chief foundations of the house of cards that collapsed so violently in 2008. Overpaid investment “geniuses” used leverage to manufacture extraordinary returns out of ordinary investments. Bankers and investors (not to mention home buyers) deluded themselves into thinking they could earn high returns without assuming big risks. But leverage is like alcohol: a little bit has health benefits, but too much can kill you. The banks’ near-death experiences, plus preparation for higher capital requirements to come, are temporarily keeping them sober. But watch for the binge drinking to return.6. Keep It Simple, StupidModern finance profits from complexity, because befuddled customers are more profitable ones. But do all those fancy financial instruments actually do the economy any good? Paul A. Volcker, the former Fed chairman, once said the A.T.M. was the only beneficial financial innovation in the recent past. He may have exaggerated, but he had a point. Who needs credit default swaps on collateralized debt obligations, and other such concoctions?7. Standardize Derivatives and Trade Them on ExchangesDerivatives acquired a bad name in the crisis. But if they are straightforward, transparent, well collateralized, traded in liquid markets by well-capitalized counterparties and sensibly regulated, derivatives can help investors hedge risks. It is the customized, opaque, “over the counter” derivatives that are the most dangerous — and the ones more likely to serve the interests of the dealers than their customers. Dodd-Frank pushed some derivatives toward greater standardization and transparent trading on exchanges, but not enough. The industry is pushing to keep more derivatives trading out of the sunshine.8. Keep Things on the Balance SheetBefore the crisis, some banks took important financial activities off their balance sheets to hide how much leverage they had. But the joke was on them. The crisis revealed that some chief executives were only dimly aware of the off-balance-sheet entities their banks held. These “masters of the universe” hadn’t mastered their own books. Dodd-Frank specifies that “capital requirements shall take into account any off-balance-sheet activities of the company.” That’s a welcome step toward making off-balance-sheet entities safe and rare. Now regulators must make the rule work.9. Fix Perverse Compensation Offering traders monumental rewards for success, but a mere slap on the wrist for failure, encourages them to take excessive risks. Chief executives and corporate directors should “claw back” pay when putative gains turn into losses. If they don’t, we may need the heavy hand of government to do it.10. Watch Out for ConsumersThe meek won’t inherit their fair share of the earth if they are constantly being fleeced. What we learned in the crisis is that failure to protect unsophisticated consumers from financial predators can undermine the whole economy. That surprising lesson mustn’t be forgotten. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau should institutionalize it.Mark Twain is said to have quipped that while history doesn’t repeat itself, it does rhyme. There will be financial crises in the future, and the next one won’t be a carbon copy of the last. Neither, however, will it be so different that these commandments won’t apply. Financial history does rhyme, but we’re already forgetting the meter."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/opinion/why-obama-cant-stop-raising-money.html,"ANNAPOLIS, Md.IN the last campaign cycle, Barack Obama headlined 220 fund-raisers, unprecedented for a presidential re-election effort, and collected more than $1 billion. So one might think that he should be free to focus exclusively on governing. But that’s not likely.There was a time when periods of campaigning and of governing were clearly divided. “Since he is President, he cannot be politically active until well after the July Convention,” advisers to President Harry S. Truman wrote in a 1947 pre-campaign memo. “He must be President of all the people and not merely the leader of a party, until the very last minute.”That time is long gone. Mr. Obama’s first term bore the two hallmarks of what has become the permanent campaign: disproportionate travel to key electoral states and substantial time dedicated to political fund-raising from practically the moment he took office.The president’s time is, as Mr. Obama’s national security adviser, Thomas E. Donilon, has said, “the most precious resource in the White House.” Why, then, would Mr. Obama, who does not have to face the voters again, feel the need to stump in his second term?The answer goes back to the campaign finance reforms of the 1970s, which were intended to limit the role of money in our electoral system but which have become largely anachronistic. Individual contributions were limited, so presidents were forced to spend ever more time raising fairly small contributions from large numbers of donors, particularly as TV advertising became more prevalent and expensive. Meanwhile, in 1976 the Supreme Court struck down limits on Congressional campaign expenditures, adding to the pressure on presidents to raise money for their fellow party members.Ronald Reagan’s 100 second-term fund-raisers topped the 80 he attended in his first term. In 1986, he tried unsuccessfully to preserve his party’s control of the Senate, which Republicans had won six years earlier on the coattails of his 1980 presidential victory. In his final two years in the White House, Reagan kept raising money, to aid his party, Senate candidates and George Bush, who became the first sitting vice president elected to the presidency since 1836.Bill Clinton headlined 471 second-term fund-raisers — almost triple his first-term total of 167. He was committed to retiring the Democratic National Committee’s substantial debt following the 1996 election. Then, before the 1998 midterms and amid the Monica S. Lewinsky scandal, he tried to help his party retake Congress from the Republicans, who had swept both chambers in 1994. (Congress remained in Republican hands, and Mr. Clinton was impeached by the House but then acquitted by the Senate.) In his final years in office he raised yet more money, to help his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, who moved to New York to run for the Senate, as well Vice President Al Gore, who campaigned to succeed him.George W. Bush headlined 155 fund-raisers in his second term; he was on course to surpass the 173 in his first term until the 2008 financial crisis made him cancel a series of appearances. He failed to block the Democrats from taking both houses of Congress in 2006. But even as his approval ratings plunged to record lows, he remained his party’s most prolific fund-raiser until he left office.Since Mr. Obama took office, the permanent campaign has ramped up even more. Last year, neither major-party presidential nominee accepted public financing for the first time since the program was created as a pillar of the reforms of the ’70s. The Supreme Court’s 2010 decision in the Citizens United case, which empowered outside political groups to raise money free from contribution limits, has only added to the fund-raising demands on the president.Presidents are frequently criticized for campaigning instead of governing, but in a highly polarized era without lasting Congressional majorities, the stakes every two years grow ever higher: witness the gridlock between the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican majority in the House. For the White House, campaigning does not come at the expense of governing but facilitates the possibility of more effective governing — not to mention the establishment of a political legacy.Mr. Obama has already pledged to raise money for the special election in Massachusetts for the seat that Senator John Kerry will vacate if he is confirmed as secretary of state. Unlimited campaign spending, relatively low contribution limits and narrow margins of party control in both houses of a bitterly divided Congress ensure that the fund-raising will only accelerate. After all, the battle of 2014 is already under way."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/global/hitting-the-mute-switch-on-europes-music-retailers.html,"PARIS — Across Europe, music is once again fueling protests, strikes and sit-ins. In a twist on the 1960s, it is the music sellers, rather than the listeners, who are up in arms.Employees of two HMV record stores in Limerick, Ireland, started sit-ins last week, demanding unpaid wages after the chain, based in Britain, filed for bankruptcy protection.In France, workers at Virgin Megastore music and video shops went on strike this month after that chain, too, was declared insolvent and placed under a court-appointed administrator, threatening the stores with closure.In Italy, workers at Fnac, which sells compact discs, DVDs, books and consumer electronics, took similar action last autumn after the Italian division of the French chain was sold to private equity investors, who are expected to shut stores and cut jobs.Faced with the possible demise of a broad swath of its retail infrastructure for music, movies and other media, Europe is, in some ways, merely catching up with the United States — and with the technological and economic forces that have swept through the entertainment industry. Tower Records, the U.S. equivalent of HMV or Virgin Megastore, shut down in 2006, unable to compete with online retailers like Amazon.com and iTunes, from Apple, as well as digital pirates. Tower Records in Japan, which split from the U.S. company about 10 years ago, continues to operate.But the threat to bricks-and-mortar shops selling music and movies is being seen as a broader economic and cultural calamity for Europe. Not only are thousands of jobs at stake; these chains, European owned, also play important roles in disseminating locally produced media. Waiting in the wings to replace them are mostly American-owned Internet giants, whose growing presence and smaller contributions to European fiscal coffers worry policy makers.“The physical cultural businesses are threatened today because of the emergence of large online sites that completely avoid fair competition, since they do not pay the same taxes as others, being based outside France,” the French culture minister, Aurélie Filippetti, said in a radio interview with Europe 1.In addition to the potential economic fallout, there is nostalgia. HMV, for example, is an iconic British retailer, in business since 1921, when the composer Edward Elgar attended the opening of the first shop in London. HMV stands for “His Master’s Voice,” the title of a painting by Francis Barraud that became the basis for a widely used music industry trademark, in which a dog is mesmerized by the sound emanating from a phonograph.The owner of that first store, called the Gramophone Co., was a precursor to the British record company EMI, which recently passed into foreign hands when it was sold to Universal Music Group, controlled by the French media conglomerate Vivendi.“People feel very emotional about all this. They feel very sad about it,” said Neil Saunders, an analyst at Conlumino, a retail consulting firm in London. “They say, ‘HMV is a part of my youth.’ And then you ask them when they last went into an HMV store, and they say, ‘Um, three years ago?”’Digital music is making significant inroads in Europe, several years after it did so in the United States, where it already accounts for more than half the market. In Britain, digital outlets accounted for 32 percent of music industry revenue of $1.4 billion in 2011, according to the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, up from 19 percent two years earlier.Counting compact discs sold by Internet mail-order businesses like Amazon.com, as well as digital services like iTunes, online distribution accounted for 73.5 percent of music and video sales in Britain last year, according to Conlumino. That could rise to 90 percent by the end of 2015, the firm forecasts.The problems at HMV, Virgin and Fnac have heightened the scrutiny of online retailers like Amazon, with politicians in France and Britain accusing the company of unfair competition because of the strategies it employs to reduce its taxes in Europe. Amazon routes its European sales through Luxembourg, where corporate taxes are lower than in France or Britain.Amazon has insisted that the practice complies with E.U. law, and analysts say that in any case the difference in tax rates is a relatively minor factor in the decline of physical retailers like HMV, Virgin and Fnac. A bigger difference is rent; it is much cheaper to operate a mail-order warehouse in an industrial park than a megastore on the Champs-Élysées in Paris or Oxford Street in London.“There has been a structural change in the way we shop, and the business models of the physical retailers no longer add up,” Mr. Saunders said.The retail crisis has engulfed two other British chains: the local arm of Blockbuster, the video-rental business, and Jessops, a camera and video chain, which collapsed last week. In both cases, court-appointed administrators were named to oversee sales or shutdowns.With 4,500 jobs at risk at more than 200 HMV stores, the company’s chief executive, Trevor Moore, has pledged to try to save as much of the chain as possible. Several potential bidders have expressed an interest, even though accountants from Deloitte have taken over day-to-day oversight.HMV has already been bailed out by one of its suppliers, EMI, which is paying the rent on 16 of HMV’s stores to keep an important sales channel alive. But analysts said it would be difficult for EMI’s new owner, Universal, to take over HMV, as E.U. regulators had already required Universal to make significant divestitures to complete the deal.In Italy, the eight Fnac stores — in Florence, Milan, Naples, Rome, Turin and other major cities — were sold last year to a private equity firm, Orlando Italy Management, by their French owner, the retail conglomerate PPR, after losing money for years.An employees’ group says it expects the new owners to announce a restructuring plan Tuesday, including the closing of Fnac stores and the elimination of more than half of the 550 jobs in Italy.Fnac is also struggling at home in France, where it operates under a public pledge to support local music. Sales at Fnac, which also has stores scattered outside the country, declined a further 3.2 percent in 2011, prompting PPR to announce last year that it was exploring a public offering of the chain. The spinoff of Fnac, formed in 1954 as a buyers’ club, caused the news site Mediapart to lament “the end of a cultural exception.”Fnac is at least doing better than the French Virgin Megastores, one of the last remnants of a once sprawling international retail empire built by the British entrepreneur Richard Branson. Mr. Branson’s company, Virgin Group, has sold those stores, and outside France, many of them have been shut; a handful are still operating in the Middle East, as well as in airports and train stations.As with HMV, several potential buyers have expressed an interest in the French Virgin Megastores, which are owned by a private equity firm, Butler Capital Partners.The more than 1,000 workers at the 26 Virgin Megastores in France are not sitting around silently, waiting to learn their futures. During a demonstration outside the store on the Champs-Élysées, which has witnessed an influx of American fashion chains and motorcycle supply shops, one employee told the French newspaper Libération: “Do we want the most beautiful avenue in the world to have nothing but garages and apparel boutiques, or do we want it to show what France can do in terms of culture?”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/business/battery-fire-resolution-may-weigh-on-boeing.html,"Until smoldering batteries forced safety regulators to ground Boeing’s new 787 Dreamliner jets last week, the aircraft manufacturer was flying high, with soaring profits and a recently regained No. 1 ranking in jet deliveries over Airbus.But the grounding, prompted by a battery fire on one jet and the emergency landing of another, has knocked Boeing off stride. Now, investors as well as government officials are paying close attention to see how big the issue becomes for the company, which is one of the nation’s biggest exporters.Although company officials said they expected to find a solution quickly, federal regulators on Sunday ruled out one simple explanation — that the battery was overcharged. If the problems prove more complicated, they could threaten Boeing’s plans to expand production of the planes, and the jobs that go with them.“Boeing has a lot at stake, for its headlining airliner and for the company brand,” said Scott Hamilton, the managing director of the Leeham Company, an aviation consulting firm in Issaquah, Wash.Mr. Hamilton said he had no doubt that Boeing would “work its way through this.” But until more is known about the batteries, he said, “it’s impossible to draw conclusions about what went wrong, what the fix is, how long it will take and what the long-term damage to the 787 and to the Boeing brands will be.”In what would seem to be the worst possible outcome right now, Boeing might also have to redesign its powerful new lithium-ion battery system, or even switch back to older, safer models. Aviation experts said such changes could cost hundreds of millions of dollars and shave off some of the 20 percent savings in fuel costs that the new jets have delivered.Analysts say Boeing, which has about $80 billion a year in sales, has the financial muscle to weather the problems and make production of the next generation of airliners succeed in an industry familiar with outsize bets.But the recent incidents were a reminder of the manufacturing and testing mishaps that had delayed the development of the planes. And any lengthy new delay could tax the patience of airlines and investors who thought the Chicago-based company had put the problems behind it.Boeing’s stock has dropped only 3.4 percent, to $75.04 a share, in the two weeks since the battery fire on a 787 parked at Logan International Airport in Boston. The Federal Aviation Administration grounded the jets after another 787 made an emergency landing in Japan on Wednesday because of a smoke alarm in the cockpit. The F.A.A.’s order applied to six United jets; an additional 44 around the world have also been grounded.David E. Strauss, an analyst at UBS, said big investors were “cautiously optimistic” that the batteries just came from a bad manufacturing batch or could be fixed with minor changes.But, he said, “if the F.A.A. came out tomorrow and said to redesign the battery, and Boeing said it would take three months, the stock is going to go down on that.”“Investors have been expecting that Boeing would finally start freeing itself of the cash drain from all the problems in developing the plane and that they would start to see more rewards now,” he added.The National Transportation Safety Board said Sunday that it had ruled out excessive voltage as the cause of the battery fire on the 787 in Boston, adding to the mystery of the cause.Besides the hazards to passengers if fire or smoke escaped from the battery containers, the problems are important because the 787 relies more on electrical systems than previous planes. Its use of electric rather than hydraulic systems is one of the innovations, along with more efficient engines and a lightweight carbon-composite structure, enabling the plane to save on fuel.Boeing officials have said they had not previously had any problems with the batteries during 1.3 million hours of flights by their test pilots and eight airlines. Marc R. Birtel, a Boeing spokesman, said Saturday that one lithium-ion battery caught fire in 2006 during tests that Boeing held with the F.A.A. But he said the problems stemmed from the way the test was set up, and not from the battery design.Depending on its agreements with each airline, Boeing was probably spending several hundred thousand dollars to $1.5 million a day to compensate carriers for lost passenger traffic or the need to lease other jets to maintain service, analysts said. Those penalties might be paid as a mix of cash and discounts on future plane purchases.Boeing also plans to keep building 787s, at its current rate of five a month, to keep its supply chain intact. Mr. Strauss, the UBS analyst, estimated that the company spent $175 million to $225 million on each plane, so that would tie up more cash if it took time to fix the problems.And the costs would mount even more rapidly if the planes remained grounded for several months or significant design changes were needed. That could slow Boeing’s plans to increase production to seven jets a month in mid-2013 and 10 a month by the end of the year.Still, Boeing, which also has a giant military business, has about $11 billion in cash, and it cannot build some of its other planes, like the 737 and the 777, fast enough to keep up with the demand.The 737 and 777 programs “are printing money,” said Richard L. Aboulafia, an aviation analyst at the Teal Group in Fairfax, Va.“This is why small, niche companies don’t build large commercial jets,” he said. “You need multiple product lines to insulate yourself from problems.”One risk for Boeing is that adjustments in the lithium-ion batteries could require changes in other electrical equipment. But the biggest risk is that the batteries could prove too volatile, and Boeing would have to redesign its systems to use heavier and less-efficient nickel-cadmium batteries.Some technical experts doubted that such a drastic change would be needed. But smaller lithium-ion batteries have caused fires in cellphones and laptops in the past. Cessna was forced to replace lithium-ion batteries on its CJ4 business jet with nickel-cadmium after a battery fire on the plane in 2011.Airbus is using lithium-ion batteries in its new A350 XWB jet, which is scheduled to enter service in 2014. But Airbus said the batteries in its plane, which will compete with the 787 for sales, were smaller than Boeing’s and carried lower voltages, making them less vulnerable to problems.The F.A.A. set a series of conditions in 2007 to ensure that the 787’s batteries did not overheat or spew flammable materials. It was reviewing whether the company had properly taken those steps.“Until they can replicate what happened, people won’t feel 100 percent confident,” said Howard A. Rubel, an analyst at Jefferies & Company. “You know they have to replicate it.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/education/georgia-backed-scholarships-benefit-schools-barring-gays.html,"ATLANTA — As the nation works its way through the debate over vouchers and other alternatives to traditional public education funding, a quieter battle over homosexuality, religious education and school tax money is under way in Georgia.At issue is an increasingly popular tax credit program that transforms state money into private school scholarships, some of them used at religious-based schools that prohibit gay, lesbian or bisexual students from attending.The policies at more than 100 such schools are explicit.The 400 students at a private school in Woodstock, for example, must adhere to a policy that states, “Homosexual behavior, whether an ‘immoral act’ or ‘identifying statement,’ is incompatible with enrollment at Cherokee Christian Schools and is a basis for dismissal.”A male student at the Shiloh Hills Christian School in Kennesaw, who utters “I like boys” or “I am a homosexual” will be expelled.And at the 800-student Providence Christian Academy 20 miles north of Atlanta, a student who is gay, lesbian or bisexual or supports people who are could be kicked out.At least 115 religious-based schools in Georgia have severe antigay policies, according to a report issued this month by the Southern Education Foundation. Public information about the scholarship program is limited by law, so the number is probably much higher, according to the foundation, which was founded in 1867 to improve education for poor children in the South.Steve Suitts, the vice president of the foundation and the author of the report, said that as many as a third of the schools in the scholarship program have strict antigay policies or adhere to a religious philosophy that holds homosexuality as immoral or a sin.As a result, his report says, public money is being spent by private educational institutions that “punish, denounce and even demonize students in the name of religion solely because they are gay, state that they are homosexual, happen to have same-sex parents or guardians, or express support or tolerance for gay students at school, away from school or at home.”The foundation and other supporters of public education have long been critical of the state’s tax scholarship program, which has proved popular among parents at both liberal and conservative private schools.The scholarships allow individuals and corporations to receive state tax credits for thousands of dollars in donations to nonprofit groups that, in turn, give the money to private schools. The scholarships are often aimed at public school children from low-income families who cannot afford private school.The tax credit scholarships were conceived in Arizona in 1997 and now run in 11 states, gaining strength each year among people aligned with the school choice movement.But they have also brought legal challenges from opponents who call the scholarships “neo-vouchers” and argue that they mask the use of public money to pay for education at private schools whose philosophical and educational underpinnings are at odds with state standards.The program is intended to avoid conflicts between church and state because the money is collected and distributed by nonprofit organizations.There is little state oversight of those organizations. The Georgia legislature in 2011 tightened the rules regarding how much information about the program the Department of Revenue, which keeps track of the money, can make public.Since the Georgia program began in 2008, $170 million in tax credits have been given to people who donated to the nonprofit organizations that funnel money to private schools.State Representative Earl Ehrhart, a Republican who runs the Faith First Georgia state scholarship organization, has said he will push to increase the amount of state money allocated each year for the scholarships to $100 million during this legislative session.“There is a real taste for anything that promotes school choice in Georgia,” he told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.But other lawmakers promise to push back, especially in light of some of the exclusionary policies under which the private schools operate.“We are circumventing our own public policy with public money,” said State Representative Stacey Abrams, the leader of the Democratic minority in the House. “In our public schools, we do not disallow a child from attending on the basis of their sexual orientation.”“If this were to be happening at any public school,” she said, “the lawsuit would be great and the settlement extraordinary.”No families whose children have been expelled over sexual orientation from a school that uses the tax scholarship program have come forward in Georgia.But in Pennsylvania, a teacher at the Covenant Christian Academy filed a federal lawsuit last summer because her contract was not renewed after she supported her son when he came out as gay on Facebook during his senior year. She dropped the case after a settlement was reached.School administrators, legislators and parents who prefer an education based on a specific biblical moral code say the program helps the state save money. Children whose families might not otherwise be able to afford private school tuition get an accredited education at less cost to the state than if the student stayed in public school.And, they argue, the scholarship program is not discriminatory because it is open to all kinds of schools that might have different philosophical foundations than state-run public schools. It is a matter of choice and religious freedom, they say.“You can be a Jewish school. You can be a Muslim school. It’s the same as a Catholic school or if I wanted to go to an all-girls school or a homosexual school,” said Claudia Hunt, who runs admissions for the Providence Christian Academy, a kindergarten-through-12th-grade school in Lilburn.“That is why we are independent schools,” she said. “We all have different missions.”Last year, Ms. Hunt said, the state scholarship program helped 28 low-income students attend Providence, where prayer and church attendance are a part of the curriculum. High school tuition at the school is $13,000 a year, and the average amount of state-supported help is $4,000 per student, she said.“I can’t recommend it enough,” she said."

Unreasonably high health care costs jeopardize the federal budget and the budgets of states, businesses, families and others who buy health insurance.Medicare spending is actually slowing faster than private health plans, a trend partly attributed to reforms passed as part of the Affordable Care Act.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/nyregion/north-brooklyn-start-ups-find-office-space-is-scarce.html,"At Secret Clubhouse, a communal working space near Bedford Avenue in Williamsburg, the co-founders of the digital marketing company Small Girls PR never have to worry about paying the electric bill. They did not have to buy the long white desks they share with other young entrepreneurs. If they want coffee, the machine downstairs is always stocked. And there is always someone else to talk to.For the founders, Mallory Blair, 24, and Bianca Caampued, 28, working at Secret Clubhouse — one of several communal, or “co-working,” spaces that house the budding technology and new media community in north Brooklyn — has freed them to expand their business. But with four part-time employees and more on the way, they are starting to think about finding a space of their own.“We want to stay in this area for sure,” said Ms. Blair, who like Ms. Caampued also lives in the neighborhood. “We could be anywhere, but we choose to be in Brooklyn because that’s where everything’s happening.”They may find the search for a bigger office rough going. Though there are plenty of start-ups that favor Williamsburg and Greenpoint, developers, local officials and real estate brokers say there is a dearth of office space. Most landlords, lured by the promise of building lucrative apartments in the increasingly popular residential area, are reluctant to devote space to commercial tenants who can pay little and might wither as quickly as they bloom.For some longtime residents and younger champions of north Brooklyn, the shortage raises the specter of a creative, economically diverse neighborhood turning into just another bedroom community. Will entrepreneurs follow the lead of Kickstarter, which is renovating an old factory in Greenpoint to serve as its long-term headquarters, or will the area’s booming residential market squeeze out everything but wealthy commuters?“Ultimately, it’s another 100,000 people on the Bedford L train, and are these people contributing to the culture and community of Williamsburg in a way that a start-up like Kickstarter will contribute to the culture and community of the neighborhood?” asked Andy Smith, the events and curriculum coordinator at the Yard, a co-working space on the border of Greenpoint and Williamsburg. “It’s a really interesting time. I see it leaning one way, and I get a little worried.”Although many buildings have retail space on the first floor, upper-floor offices are hard to come by, according to several people who have recently looked; one broker, Drew Conner of the commercial real estate company Cushman & Wakefield, said he had had three start-up clients turn to Dumbo or Lower Manhattan in the past year.There is space, of course. But not much of it meets the needs of fast-changing start-ups, which typically cannot afford to outfit raw industrial rooms with wiring, lighting and carpeting, and require flexible leases and reliable Internet and telephone service.Filling that gap, for now, are communal offices. Rick Webb, the proprietor of Secret Clubhouse, opened the space last summer after hearing from several friends and acquaintances that they needed desks. He and a broker scoured the neighborhood for four months, finally locating a storefront that landlords were not looking to fill with a bar or a restaurant.Politicians have begun to take note. Assemblyman Joseph R. Lentol, a Democrat from Brooklyn, is trying to attract support for a bill that would establish a creative economic zone in north Brooklyn, with incentives for mixed-use developments and a mentorship program for young entrepreneurs.The idea was hatched after Mr. Lentol’s office interviewed young business owners involved in music, film production, technology and media, who said they wanted to be able to both live and work in the neighborhood.“Our goal is to stimulate a live-work, idea-driven economy in north Brooklyn,” Mr. Lentol said.That idea has also found a champion in William Harvey, an artist and designer who moved to Greenpoint in the mid-1980s. “There’s the presumption, ‘Oh, Williamsburg, that’s where all the cool stuff is going to happen,’ and it should be,” he said. “But if we just look forward in terms of how things will be built, it’ll be very difficult to have a sustainable new economy here.”Part of the problem is zoning: though parts of Williamsburg and Greenpoint are zoned for mixed commercial and residential use, the zoning tilts residential. The bigger issue is supply, or as developers might see it, demand.“The retail market’s been incredibly strong, the residential market’s been incredibly strong, so unless the site is restricted from doing residential, it’s not a good economic deal to build an office building,” said Jeremiah Kane, a senior adviser to Rubenstein Partners, a commercial real estate investment firm, who said he saw enough companies looking for space in the area to make it a priority for the firm.He said it was not uncommon for the owners of old factories or warehouses — the kind of industrial building every developer wants — to refuse to sell because they are holding out for their properties to be rezoned for residential use.“For a lot of tech start-ups, so much of it is about recruiting the right people,” he said, “and as those right people live over in Brooklyn or live over in Williamsburg, being close to them is a real advantage.”At last count, 87 percent of the tenants of the Yard — a sleek co-working space overlooking McCarren Park — lived within a mile of the office.“The companies that are in Williamsburg are cool — a lot of the ones I know hug the intersection of art and music and technology,” said Cody Brown, 24, who helped create scroll kit, an application that allows those with no coding skills to create Web sites, in a Bushwick apartment where he and his co-founder, Kate Ray, still live. With a round of financing under their belt, Mr. Brown and Ms. Ray, 25, decided they had outgrown their living room. Finding nothing suitable in Williamsburg, their first choice, they landed in a co-working space in SoHo. They said they hoped to come back to Brooklyn."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/world/middleeast/iran-resorts-to-hangings-in-public-to-cut-crime.html,"TEHRAN — An eerie silence filled the air as a crowd of around 300 gathered Sunday just before sunrise in a Tehran park. They awaited the arrival of two young men who were about to die.The condemned stood shoulder to shoulder, motionless, in front of two police trucks with two nooses hanging from extendable cranes, about 15 feet high. Black-clad executioners were inspecting the remote controls they would use to hang the men, both in their early 20s, who were convicted of stabbing a man in November and stealing his bag and the equivalent of $20.From behind a makeshift barrier of scaffolding, the crowd jostled for position. “Let’s move to the other side,” one spectator whispered to his wife, pointing to the spot where Iranian state television cameras had been set up. “I think we will have a better view from there.”Although every year hundreds of convicts are hanged in Iran, a public hanging in a central park in Tehran is a rare event. Most hangings take place inside prisons, according to Iranian judicial officials and international human rights organizations.Sunday’s execution in Park-e Honarmandan (Artists Park), near the crime scene, was part of a heavy-handed offensive by Iranian authorities, who say they are trying to prevent rising crime rates from getting out of hand by setting harsh examples. In recent weeks, public executions have been stepped up, and in several large cities the police have been rounding up what they call thugs and hooligans.Police commanders and other officials blame government mismanagement of the economy — which they say has caused a rise in unemployment and inflation — for the increase in crime. International economic sanctions have aggravated problems, many here say, leading to a record gap between rich and poor in Iran.While no official statistics are publicly available, officials report a rise in violent crimes, mostly perpetrated by young men attacking their victims with knives to get money and other valuables. Local news media report only a fraction of the episodes, but at social gatherings of middle-class Iranians — the usual targets — horrific stories of theft, kidnapping, rape and home burglaries abound.“Two young men entered my house two weeks ago and beat me senseless,” said Manijeh, 54, a homemaker from north Tehran, a more affluent section of the city. The intruders bound her arms and legs and beat her, asking for the location of the safe, she said. “But we don’t have a safe,” said Manijeh, who declined to reveal her surname out of fear that the burglars would return. They stole her car, ransacked her home and took nearly everything inside, she said.“Our city has become completely unsafe,” said Manijeh, speaking after her recent release from a hospital. “These things would never happen until some years ago. We need the harshest measures to stop these criminals.”Armin, 30, an engineer, said his father was recently robbed and beaten by a gang of thieves on motorcycles. “They hit him hard, but afterwards he received an anonymous call telling him where to find his bag,” he said. “They took all his money but returned his documents.”On Sunday, the two condemned men, Alireza Mafiha, 23, and Mohammad Ali Sarvari, 20, stood before the onlookers, many of whom said they were family members and friends.“They have shaved his hair,” said one young man pointing at Mr. Mafiha who said he knew both men. Mr. Sarvari, baby-faced, stared wide-eyed into the crowd.The two men, both unemployed and from poor families, had been caught two months ago on a security camera robbing a man and stabbing him, helped by two accomplices. Video from the crime spread on the Internet and caused a widespread uproar, prompting politicians and clerics to call for harsh measures.Two weeks later, all four men were arrested. The head of Iran’s judiciary, Ayatollah Sadegh Larijani, made it clear in comments on the crime that even though their victim had not died, a death sentence for the two main defendants, Mr. Mafiha and Mr. Sarvari, was likely. “We need to act assertively and increase the costs for those committing street crimes,” he said, according to the semiofficial Fars news agency.During their trial, Mr. Mafiha said he needed money to pay for an operation for his mother. He and Mr. Sarvari had both lost their fathers at an early age, their lawyer explained. “We needed the money because of poverty; I am sorry,” said Mr. Mafiha, the semiofficial Iranian Students’ News Agency reported in December.Judge Abdolghassem Salavati, notorious for his harsh treatment of those arrested during intense street protests in 2009, convicted both men of being “mohareb,” a Shiite legal term that translates as “waging war against God”; the crime carries the death sentence in Iran. Judge Salavati said the two men had threatened public security and caused fear and intimidation. He sentenced each of their two accomplices to 10 years in prison, followed by five years in exile in a provincial town, and also to 74 lashes.Many in Tehran applauded the harsh sentence for Mr. Mafiha and Mr. Sarvari, saying they hoped that it would make criminals think twice about attacking people. But others doubted that would happen.“The number of quarrels, suicide, murder and crime are all up,” Amanollah Qaraei Moghadam, a sociologist, recently wrote on Mellat Online, an Internet news site. “It is 100 percent clear the situation will not change unless the economy improves.”Other critics said the punishment was far too severe. “Why were these men executed? They didn’t kill anybody,” said Saleh Nikbakht, a lawyer who regularly defends dissidents and political activists. “More severe punishments will not mean there will be less crimes. We have deeper problems.”On Sunday, as the sun slowly started rising in the east of Tehran, the executioners led Mr. Mafiha and Mr. Sarvari to the cranes. Three young women in the crowd begged for forgiveness, but a representative of Iran’s judiciary described the crime and read out the verdict.Mr. Mafiha, in tears, laid his head on the shoulder of one of the executioners, who placed his arm around him. After the nooses were placed around their necks, both men were pulled up by the two cranes. They died silently as many in the crowd shouted in protest, while others used smartphone cameras to record the scene.“This is not fair,” said one young man, crying loudly while being dragged away by another friend. “If they hadn’t been caught on camera this would have never happened to them.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/nyregion/east-village-protests-its-new-and-familiar-neighbor.html,"Inside a church in the East Village last week, about 40 people raised alarms about another imminent addition to the ever-changing local landscape.Over the years, residents of this rebellious neighborhood have joined forces to fight the profusion of bars in the area, the selling of community gardens to real estate developers and the possibility that high-rises would be added to the mostly low-rise skyline. Now the target of their ire is 7-Eleven, the convenience store giant whose expanding presence there has prompted concern about an invasion of national chains.“Boring, bland and not New York,” said Bob Holman, a poet and the owner of the Bowery Poetry Café, who also denounced the stores as part of a process of “suburbanization” that catered to newer, younger arrivals in the neighborhood.Not long ago it was impossible to find a Slurpee in Manhattan. Although there were 7-Eleven stores there from 1978 to 1982, they did not become a prominent presence until 2005, when the company began a new push in the city. There are now 32 stores in the borough, and last year the company announced plans to open about 100 more.Workers recently began building one of the stores at the corner of East 11th Street and Avenue A, prompting the meeting at Father’s Heart Church, about a block east.A man who introduced himself to the crowd as Liberation suggested that the group create a central Web site to organize opposition. Others at the meeting proposed a “bodega walk” to promote existing businesses, and two participants said they would create a “No 7-Eleven alternative shopping guide.”A 7-Eleven spokeswoman, Margaret Chabris, said by e-mail that the company had decided that “a high concentration of young adults and young families on a budget” made the East Village a good spot to open stores.“We want to make the lives of neighborhood residents better by offering a dependable and convenient environment with value-priced goods,” she wrote. “If we fulfill that mission, the community will support these stores as they have in other areas of New York City.”A few 7-Eleven stores have already opened in the gentrifying East Village. Although a group of black-clad youths participating in an anti-capitalist march broke the window of one store on St. Marks Place last spring, the 11th Street store has engendered sustained opposition.Over the last several months, some people have chalked protest messages on sidewalks outside the store, where workers are carrying out a renovation. Others slapped stickers calling for a boycott on a wooden construction shed in front of the store.Recently, an anonymous opponent of the store sent a communiqué to a local blog, EV Grieve, announcing the printing of 20,000 stickers reading “Shopping 7-11? Shame on You!”Part of the strong reaction to the 11th Street store is because of its location at the southeast corner of Avenue A. Chain stores have been present for years in the East Village, but so far the blocks north of Houston Street between Avenue A and Avenue D, which some consider to be the heart of the neighborhood, have been empty of establishments like Dunkin’ Donuts, McDonald’s and 7-Eleven.There are some who would like to make the absence of such stores permanent in that part of the East Village. Several people meeting at the church last week said they planned to lobby elected officials to adopt a measure like one in San Francisco, where chain stores and chain restaurants are not allowed to open in certain areas without a public hearing and approval from the city planning commission.Some at the meeting acknowledged that it was most likely too late to stop the 11th Street 7-Eleven from opening, but they said they thought that a public airing of their views might encourage others to join them in trying to prevent additional chain stores from following it.“One of our tactics is to spread the word wide,” said Rob Hollander, who organized the meeting. “To dynamize New Yorkers who sit and watch this happen around them.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/business/bank-of-japan-expands-efforts-to-prop-up-nations-economy.html,"TOKYO (AP) — Bowing to government pressure, Japan’s central bank on Tuesday pledged more aggressive action to lift the economy, including setting a 2 percent inflation target.The Bank of Japan said it would conduct “open-ended” asset purchases to help achieve the goal of breaking out of a long spell of deflation.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe had urged the central bank to ease monetary policy further to prop up the economy.Whether the effort will succeed remains to be seen: the central bank has not achieved even its 1 percent inflation target, with price increases hovering below 0.5 percent for the past two years despite surges in energy costs.The central bank described its inflation goal as a “price stability target.” It said: “Under the price stability target, the bank will pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time.”But it said it would also “ascertain whether there is any significant risk to the sustainability of economic growth, including from the accumulation of financial imbalances.”Among the risks are a ballooning public debt, already well over twice the size of Japan’s gross domestic product.Mr. Abe’s government is seeking to spur growth both through heavy spending on public works and other projects and through monetary easing. The central bank’s announcement on Tuesday was in line with expectations.The government was determined that the central bank set a 2 percent inflation target, the trade minister, Toshimitsu Motegi, told reporters on Monday. “We want a clear inflation target to aim for,” Mr. Motegi said. “Other countries have inflation targets, and it’s not just 1 percent. They are all at least 2 percent,” he said.He said the monetary easing, which has involved tens of trillions of yen (hundreds of billions of dollars) in asset purchases and years of near-zero interest rates, so far had been “inadequate.”The Abe government is expected to nominate as Bank of Japan governor an expert known to favor its policies when the term of the current governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, ends this spring.However, Mr. Motegi rejected accusations that the government’s demands were meant to erode the central bank’s independent status.“We are not doing this to gang up and pick on Mr. Shirakawa,” he said. But he added that “the policy of aiming to escape deflation will not change, not today, not tomorrow or the day after tomorrow.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/a-plan-to-cut-social-security-benefits.html,"To the Editor:Re “Misguided Social Security ‘Reform’ ” (editorial, Jan. 13):I share your concern that President Obama has been too eager to go along with Congressional Republicans to reduce Social Security benefits by lowering cost-of-living adjustments for millions of retirees, widows and orphans. The consequences of shifting to a “chained” Consumer Price Index would be even worse than you described.The chained C.P.I. would take benefits away from more than three million disabled veterans and their families. A veteran who began receiving V.A. disability benefits at 30 would have benefits reduced by $1,425 at 45 and by $3,231 at 65, according to the Congressional Budget Office.The chained C.P.I. would also result in across-the-board tax increases with a disproportionate effect on working families. According to the Joint Committee on Taxation, switching to a chained C.P.I. would increase taxes by $59.6 billion over the next decade. More than three-quarters of the new revenue raised by the year 2021 would come from Americans making less than $200,000 a year.Those making between $30,000 and $40,000 would be hit the hardest, while those making more than $1 million would see virtually no change.At a time when corporations are enjoying record profits and the gap between the very rich and everyone else is growing wider, there are better ways to reduce the deficit than cutting programs for the elderly, veterans and the sick.BERNARD SANDERSBurlington, Vt., Jan. 14, 2013 The writer, the Vermont independent, is  chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans’ Affairs in the new Congress.To the Editor:You are to be commended for opposing the proposal by the Obama administration and others to index Social Security retirement benefits to a revised cost-of-living measure, the “chained” Consumer Price Index. But rising rates of economic insecurity among the elderly, especially among women and people of color, demonstrate that the current C.P.I. measure is not adequate for estimating the real costs of living for seniors.One new measure is the Elder Economic Security Standard Index, developed by Wider Opportunities for Women. This index has also been calculated state by state, and New York State is among those where costs are high.Another measure, the Senior Financial Stability Index, was developed at Brandeis University. Both measures address the needs of those in their mid-70s and beyond when assets have dwindled and health care costs generally rise. These proposals also deserve serious consideration.JEANE W. ANASTASNew York, Jan. 13, 2013 The writer is a professor of social work at New York University.To the Editor:For 2012, the payroll taxable limit for Social Security was $110,100. Working income beyond that amount was not taxable for Social Security. This means that the millions and billions of huge incomes earned by the wealthy after the taxable limit is reached go untaxed. And now, ardent conservative Republicans are seeking to weaken Social Security.It would seem that a change to taxing all working income, with no limit, would make Social Security secure forever.JACK E.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/us-inaction-mideast-cataclysm.html,"ISRAELIS go to the polls today in an election that will likely give Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a third term; like the current one, Israel’s next governing coalition will probably be heavily reliant on right-wingers and religious parties.Even so, Mr. Obama’s second term could offer a pivotal opportunity to restart the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. In his first term, he backed away from the process, figuring that America could mediate only if the parties themselves wanted to make peace — and that new talks were unlikely to be productive.This is a mistake. The greatest enemy to a two-state solution is the sheer pessimism on both sides. Unless President Obama uses his new mandate to show leadership, the region will have no place for moderates — or for America either.The rationale for inaction rests on four related assumptions: that strident forces dominate because their ideologies do; that the status quo — demographic trends that would lead to the enfranchisement of occupied Palestinians, a “one-state solution” and the end of Israel as a Jewish democracy — will eventually force Israel to its senses; that the observer-state status secured by Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at the United Nations is empty because his West Bank government is broke, dysfunctional and lacking in broad support; and that given the strength of the Israeli lobby, Mr. Obama’s hands are tied.These assumptions seem daunting, but they are misguided. First, while Hamas, the militant Islamists who control Gaza, and Israel’s ultra-rightists, who drive the settlement enterprise, are rising in popularity, the reason is not their ideologies, but young people’s despair over the occupation’s grinding violence.Last month, a poll by the S. Daniel Abraham Center for Middle East Peace, based in Washington, found that two-thirds of Israelis would support a two-state deal, but that more than half of even left-of-center Israelis said Mr. Abbas could not reach binding decisions to end the conflict. The same month, the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research, in Ramallah, found that 52 percent of Palestinians favored a two-state resolution (a drop from three-quarters in 2006, before two Israeli clashes over Gaza). But two-thirds judged the chance of a fully functional Palestinian state in the next five years to be low or nonexistent. In short, moderates on both sides still want peace, but first they need hope.Second, the status quo is not a path to a one-state solution, but to Bosnian-style ethnic cleansing, which could erupt as quickly as the Gaza fighting did last year and spread to Israeli Arab cities. Right-wing Israelis and Hamas leaders alike are pushing for a cataclysmic fight. Mr. Abbas, whose Fatah party controls the West Bank, has renounced violence, but without signs of a viable diplomatic path he cannot unify his people to support new talks. If his government falls apart, or if the more Palestinian territory is annexed (as right-wing Israelis want), or if the standoff in Gaza leads to an Israeli ground invasion, bloodshed and protests across the Arab world will be inevitable. Such chaos might also provoke missiles from Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite militant group based in Lebanon.Third, the Palestinian state is not a Fatah-imposed fiction, but a path toward economic development, backed by international diplomacy and donations, that most Palestinians want to succeed. It has a $4 billion economy; an expanding network of entrepreneurs and professionals; and a banking system with about $8 billion in deposits. A robust private sector can develop if given a chance.Fourth, American support need not only mean direct talks. The administration could promote investments in Palestinian education and civil society that do not undermine Israeli security. Mr. Obama could demand that Israel allow Palestinian businesses freer access to talent, suppliers and customers. He could also demand a West Bank-Gaza transportation corridor, to which Israel committed in the 1993 Oslo accords.America is as much a player as a facilitator. The signal it sends helps determine whether the parties move toward war or peace. The White House, despite its frosty relationship with Mr. Netanyahu, hasn’t set itself up as a worthy mediator by opposing Palestinian membership in the United Nations and vetoing condemnations of settlements.In nominating Chuck Hagel to lead the Pentagon, Mr. Obama rightly ignored attacks by “pro-Israel” (really pro-Netanyahu) groups. He should appoint a Middle East negotiator trusted by all sides — say, Bill Clinton or Colin L. Powell. He should lead, not thwart, European attempts to make a deal. He has stated that the settlements will lead to Israel’s global isolation; he should make clear that they endanger American interests, too.Washington has crucial leverage, though this won’t last forever. When it weighs in, it becomes a preoccupying political fact for both sides. If it continues to stand back, hopelessness will win."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/us/barrett-jackson-auction-is-heaven-for-car-collectors.html,"SCOTTSDALE, Ariz. — The way Steve Davis sees it, arranging collectible cars for display at auction is like writing the script for a good action movie: “You’ve got to have a beginning that gets you excited, a middle that grips you and an end that delivers.”Barrett-Jackson, which bills itself as “the world’s greatest collector car auction,” had several tents mounted on the same expanse of green grass where horses and players convened for a polo match some months ago, as well as a main pavilion where the rarest and most valuable of all the vehicles could be found. Mr. Davis, the company’s president, arranged each of them, looking to offer “an experience” for the more than 310,000 visitors who came by over the course of six days, but ultimately to entice buyers.He positioned a 2005 Chevy Silverado by the main pavilion’s entrance, which was right by the building where 5,000 people whose combined lines of credit hit nearly $1 billion signed up to bid on roughly 1,400 vehicles — not including the potential buyers who needed no credit check to place their bids.Some of the cars were extraordinarily expensive, others were there to suit the middle market, but all of them were objects of someone’s desire, from the custom-built quarter-scale replica of a John Deere tractor, sold for $7,500, to television’s original 1966 Batmobile, sold for $4.62 million. (Except for the vehicles that were sold for charity, all prices include the buyer’s commission.)Cars were not the only attraction, though. There was a mall at which vendors were selling diamond earrings, private jets and handmade cowboy boots; racing simulators to entertain children and adults; and a lounge where women could get their hair and makeup done while sipping wine, away from the dizzying chant of the auctioneer.“Spending money is the sport here,” Mr. Davis said.And there were many enticements. The elaborately customized Silverado pickup was literally a work of art, its body adorned with scenes of combat, patriotic monuments and firefighters emerging from the smoldering remains of the World Trade Center towers. It had a polished stainless-steel frame, a hand-molded fiberglass interior, airbrushed leather seats and a formidable stereo system. Its owners, Dale and Connie Ison of Hillsboro, Ohio, said it took five years, 50,000 hours and $658,000 to get it the way it is. It sold for $209,000.The Isons said the truck was, more than anything, a repository of memories. Mr. Ison, 61, recalled meeting the son of the sailor famously pictured kissing a woman in Times Square on the day in August 1945 when the war against Japan ended, an image reproduced on the Silverado, which has been to county fairs, Veterans Day parades and even the Pentagon’s courtyard, but got to be “too much for a man my age.”Six slots in — next to the 1946 four-door Cadillac sedan that featured a rear-mounted shotgun, cowhide seats and bull horns on the hood (sale price: $77,000) — Norma and Vernon Wamsley said goodbye to the 1954 Kaiser Darrin convertible that had been theirs since 1989, when they bought it “in pieces, nuts and bolts in pails,” as Mrs. Wamsley put it.She snapped a picture of her husband, who seemed more anxious about how much the car would fetch at the auction than about giving it up for good.Barrett-Jackson featured the largest number of no-reserve cars ever auctioned, or cars that are sold to the highest bidder, regardless of what the bid might be. It is a risky proposition for the seller, as well as an enticement for potential buyers, given the possibility of bringing home a car for a lot less than what it is worth.“We’re hoping to get good funds,” said Mr. Wamsley, whose Kaiser Darrin sold for $106,700.Barrett-Jackson began as a charity fund-raising car show in the 1960s and evolved into the big event that it is today — exclusivity cloaked in a carnival atmosphere. While high rollers in skyboxes dined on scallops and sea bass, others had plenty of food choices on the pavement outside, including hot dogs and funnel cake.“I’ve been coming here for 10 years and it always blows me away,” said Jeff Otto, 52, who had never placed a bid and had no plans to bid on any car. He had flown in from Denver, bringing his son, Christopher, who is 14, and his father-in-law, Jim Stewart, who is 72.This year, gross car sales reached nearly $109 million, a 17 percent increase over last year and a tie for the record set in 2007, before the economy collapsed and car collectors kept their most prized possessions in the garage, knowing it was not a good time to sell.On Saturday, a 1955 Mercedes-Benz 300SL, which Clark Gable had bought for $7,295, sold for $2.03 million. The Batmobile — customized in 15 days, on a $15,000 budget, out of a 1955 Lincoln Futura — also sold that night, as did 21 vehicles whose proceeds went for charity. One of them was a 2009 Ford F150 Super Crew pickup truck owned by President George W. Bush (sale price: $300,000). Another was the first 2014 Corvette Stingray to hit the retail market (sale price: $1.1 million).Craig Jackson, chairman and chief executive of the Barrett-Jackson Auction Company, said the event, which ended on Sunday, is “a scene, it’s an attraction.” But the cars, he went on, are “first and foremost a huge investment.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/business/leds-emerge-as-a-popular-green-lighting.html,"The lighting industry has finally come up with an energy-efficient replacement for the standard incandescent bulb that people actually seem to like: the LED bulb.Although priced at around 20 times more than the old-fashioned incandescents, bulbs based on LEDs, or light-emitting diodes, last much longer and use far less electricity, a saving that homeowners are beginning to recognize. Prices for the bulbs are falling steadily as retailers like Home Depot and Lowe’s sell them aggressively and manufacturers improve the technology.And because the light in LED bulbs comes from chips, companies have been able to develop software applications that let users control the bulbs, even change the color of the light, with tablets and smartphones. Apple sells a three-pack of such bulbs, made by Philips, with the hardware to operate them for about $200.“You’re seeing all of your growth in the LED category,” said Brad Paulsen, a Home Depot merchant. “We absolutely expect LED technology in four or five years to be the most popular lighting technology that’s out there.”Last year, LED sales, though small at about 3 percent of the residential market by some estimates, grew faster than those of any other lighting technology, according to retailers and analysts.Among A-type bulbs, the most common, LEDs will outsell incandescents in North America in 2014, according to projections by IMS Research, an electronics research firm that is now part of IHS Inc. And LEDs will become the most popular A-type technology by 2016, with North American shipments reaching almost 370 million, a more than tenfold increase from the roughly 33 million shipped last year, the firm estimates.Already at Philips, LEDs were responsible for 20 percent of lighting sales last year, according to Ed Crawford, general manager of the lamps division.Incandescent bulbs, while cheap, are very inefficient, wasting most of their energy as heat as they pump electricity into filaments to make them glow. The government has been pushing consumers to other technologies for several years, in part by phasing out the manufacture or import of the least efficient bulbs.The first big alternative to emerge, compact fluorescent bulbs, has left many consumers dissatisfied. The light quality is seen as harsher, the bulbs can be slow to warm up and difficult to dim, and they contain toxic materials.LEDs are more expensive, but offer better light quality and more flexibility. And thanks to heavy marketing by retailers, customers are beginning to discover their appeal.“The LED you buy, even though you pay even $25 or $30, it’ll last like nine or 10 years,” said Tariq Syed, a machinist at an electrical utility who was eyeing LEDs at the Home Depot in Vauxhall, N.J., on Thursday. “And environmentally, it’s safe, too.”Bulb manufacturers are rushing into the market, sending prices falling. Home Depot sells some 40-watt-equivalent bulbs for about $10.“Most of the manufacturers are moving toward new designs in solid state lighting, as are we,” said Jim Crowcroft, vice president for market development at TCP, a company based outside Cleveland that manufactures energy-efficient lighting under its own brand as well as the house brands of several mass retailers.Although the company still sells far more compact fluorescent lights, growth in that business has slowed, while demand for LEDs is skyrocketing, he said. “In the long run, solid-state lighting is going to make a whole lot of sense for almost every lighting application.”For the manufacturers, LEDs pose a new challenge. They offer higher profit margins, but because they can last for decades, people will be buying fewer bulbs — of any sort. The Energy Information Administration estimates that total light bulb sales will fall by almost 40 percent by 2015, to just under a billion from 1.52 billion bulbs, and continue their decline to about 530 million by 2035, with LEDs making up a steadily increasing portion of the market.As a result, many companies are competing to establish themselves as popular brands.“The company that can dominate will make a lot of money,” said Philip Smallwood, senior lighting market analyst at IMS Research. “So it’s a big push to get into it early.”With demand growing for LEDs in other uses — like backlighted phone and computer screens, automotive lights and street lamps — manufacturers have been able to develop their technologies and benefit from economies of scale to help bring the price down, said Thomas J. Pincince, the chief executive of Digital Lumens, which sells LED systems to businesses.In the commercial and industrial sector, use of LEDs is more common than in homes, analysts say, because companies are more likely to do the long-term cost-benefit analysis of buying lighting than homeowners, who are still largely driven by the upfront price.Goldman Sachs estimates that in the residential sector, penetration of LEDs will rise from 3 percent last year to 16 percent in 2015, still lagging the commercial and industrial sector as well as outdoor applications like parking lots and billboards.But as the cost of an LED approaches $10 — a tipping point that would speed mass adoption, according to Mr. Smallwood — retailers have been stepping up their efforts to market the lights, often with proprietary brands like Home Depot’s EcoSmart jostling for shelf space with established names like Philips and General Electric.“One day I randomly walked into a Home Depot and thought, ‘LED — when did that happen?’ ” said Clayton Morris, 36, a host of “Fox & Friends Weekend,” who was buying the bulbs in Vauxhall as part of his project to slowly replace the incandescents in his Maplewood home. “It’s a hefty investment upfront,” he said, “but it just seemed like a great savings.”At the same time, in an effort to transform light bulbs from a cheap, disposable product into something that consumers might show off to their friends, manufacturers have been adding functions that could ultimately fit into a larger home automation system. Often Bluetooth- or Wi-Fi-enabled, a new generation of LED bulbs offers all manner of new remote controls and automatic responses. The Philips Hue, sold exclusively at Apple stores for the next month, can change colors along a broad spectrum and offers settings that can mimic sunrise in the morning or use a special “light recipe” intended to raise energy levels. The bulb has been a big hit, executives say, attracting a host of software developers who have created free apps for new features, like making it respond to voices or music. The bulb can also tie into the Nest thermostat, a so-called smart device from Apple alumni who helped develop the iPod, that learns consumer heating and cooling patterns and adjusts to them automatically.“For me, it was, ‘Wow, this is really cool, this is piece of futuristic technology that I could have,’ ” said Jonathan Crosby, 25, who works at an Apple store in the Bay Area and learned about the Hue because of all the customers asking about it. He bought starter kits for himself and an uncle, purchases he might not have made without the hefty employee discount.The bulbs, he said, offer a hint of the lifestyle of people like Bill Gates of Microsoft, who lives in a house loaded with high-tech conveniences. “It’s amazing, like the futuristic Bill Gates is now me,” Mr. Crosby said."

It is not just that for-profit health insurance is more costly and less efficient than the nonprofit or government alternatives; it is inherently contradictory. The more health care the insurance companies provide — the more they respond to the needs of patients — the less profit they make. That’s why they cherry-pick the healthy and avoid the sick. That’s why we patients face denials and delays when we try to receive care.The results are predictable; we have some of the worst health statistics of any advanced country. Other countries make health care a government responsibility, with the result that their people are healthier and they spend far less.When will we learn, as your headline suggested, that health care and profits don’t mix?LEONARD RODBERGFlushing, Queens, Jan. 9, 2013The writer is a professor and chairman of the urban studies department, Queens College, CUNY."

The cleric, Abul Kalam Azad, a member of the Jamaat-e-Islami party, was tried in absentia after he reportedly fled to Pakistan last April after being charged. Jamaat-e-Islami campaigned in 1971 against Bangladesh’s war of separation from Pakistan. The party is accused of supporting or in some cases taking part in atrocities committed by Pakistani troops. Bangladesh says that during the nine-month war, Pakistani troops and local collaborators killed three million people and raped about 200,000 women. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina set up the tribunal in 2010. Human rights groups have criticized it for not operating by international law, and members of the opposition say Ms. Hasina has used it to undermine her opponents."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/nyregion/one-million-moms-for-gun-control-stages-brooklyn-bridge-march.html,"It was an ice cream cone that brought Joseph Allen from New Jersey to the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge on Monday morning, where he was singing a song denouncing violence as he marched with hundreds of other parents and children to demand stricter gun control laws.Several years ago, Mr. Allen, 46, an emergency room technician, said, he was held up at gunpoint in Brooklyn in the middle of the day by three teenagers while enjoying a cherry-vanilla ice cream cone with his wife.But it took seeing a portrait of Veronica Moser-Sullivan, 6, the youngest victim of the movie-theater shooting in Aurora, Colo., last year, eating an ice cream cone with a child’s joyful abandon to galvanize him into action.“She is the one telling me, ‘God gave you a chance to live,’ ” he said, showing the little girl’s picture, which he carries with him. “She didn’t have a chance.”Mr. Allen mounted the bridge for the march, along with a group of about 200 people, by some estimates, drawn together by a social media campaign begun by Shannon Watts, a mother from Zionsville, Ind., who founded One Million Moms for Gun Control after shootings at a Connecticut school. And he admitted that he had not always been against guns.For years, Mr. Allen said, he carried a gun every day. To high school. The gun, which he had bought on the street for $150, went to class, along with his pencils and ruled notebooks, at Thomas Jefferson High School in East New York, Brooklyn — his bully deterrent, he said. He was hardly the only one who had a firearm, he said.Those were the days before metal detectors at high school doors, he added, and he carried the weapon until his mother found it in his sock drawer. She gave him the dressing down of a lifetime, he said.“It was our worst fight,” he said. The gun was gone. “My mother saved my life.”In 1992, after Mr. Allen graduated, a 15-year-old, Khalil Sumpter, fatally shot Tyrone Sinkler, 16, and Ian Moore, 17, in the second-floor hallway of his high school. Years before places like Virginia Tech and Columbine made school shootings numbly familiar, the killings drew intense public attention because of the setting and the gunman’s youth.Mr. Allen said he remained plagued by guilt that he never told the authorities about what some of his peers had carried in their knapsacks. “I felt I could have saved those lives, if they had known we all had guns at school,” he said. Mr. Allen did not know the gunman or the victims.As an icy wind picked up across the bridge, the marchers, led by Scott M. Stringer, the Manhattan borough president, made their way toward Manhattan, to congregate near City Hall. Children waved banners and some of them shouted slogans denouncing groups like the National Rifle Association: “Kids yes! Guns no! N.R.A. has got to go!I love this song!” shouted Luca Buitoni, 8, as he pushed his brother Giacomo, 5, in a stroller.Mr. Allen, meanwhile, quietly sang a song he had written about Veronica and waved a homemade placard that listed the names of other shooting victims, from Abraham Lincoln to the rapper Biggie Smalls.Madeline Smith, 59, clutched a photo of a young man — her son, Kwame A. Dancy, who was shot to death at 22 by a friend in Harlem after feuding on social media in 2009. She said that she was happy people had been prodded into action by recent mass shootings, but that gun violence was constant.“We’re all hearing gunfire every day,” said Ms. Smith, who lives in Brooklyn.At the end of the rally, Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly said, “This is a manifestation of a momentum.” He said he hoped Congress would heed the message.Mr. Allen said he was sure the march would have resonance. The protesters were marching, he pointed out, on the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday, and on the day of the second swearing-in of the nation’s first black president.“That’s one of those dreams that came true,” Mr. Allen said. His own, to curtail gun violence, he felt sure, would be realized too."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/business/global/un-agency-warns-of-rising-unemployment.html,"PARIS — More than 197 million people worldwide are jobless, and an additional 39 million have simply given up looking for work, a United Nations agency said on Monday, warning that government budget-balancing was hurting employment and would probably lead to more job losses soon.With global growth stalling five years after the financial crisis upended much of the world economy, the number of jobless is expected to rise by 5.1 million this year, to more than 202 million, the International Labor Organization said in a special report. And it predicted there would be a further three million newly jobless people next year.High unemployment rates in the developed world — 7.8 percent in the United States, 11.8 percent in the euro zone — weigh on demand and hold back economic growth. Global gross domestic product will probably expand about 3.6 percent this year, the International Monetary Fund said in October, below its previous forecast.Addressing the issue of unemployment last Thursday, the I.M.F.’s managing director, Christine Lagarde, urged governments to focus on “growth that can actually deliver jobs.”“We stopped the collapse,” Ms. Lagarde said during a news conference in Washington, warning about the risks to growth posed by complacency in Europe and difficult budget negotiations in the United States. “We should avoid the relapse, and it’s not time to relax.”The International Labor Organization found that macroeconomic imbalances “have been passed on to the labor market to a significant degree.” With aggregate demand weakening, employment “has been further hit by fiscal austerity programs in a number of countries, which often involved direct cutbacks in employment and wages, directly impacting labor markets.”More troubling, it said, was that while governments had sought to counter the effects of the financial crisis with fiscal stimulus, later austerity measures in some countries appeared to be reinforcing the downturn.The effects of the recession in Europe are being felt elsewhere through “a spillover effect,” the organization found, mostly through the mechanism of reduced demand for foreign goods, but also in the form of volatile capital inflows in places like Latin America and the Caribbean. These forces have left policy makers with difficult choices about how to keep soaring currencies in check without strangling economic growth.The agency said that it was common for the rate of job creation to be slow after a financial crisis, but that there had been “a short-lived respite” for developed countries beginning in 2010. That period has now ended, and once again “further job restructuring is likely before a stronger rebound can be expected in labor markets.”More people were simply leaving the job market altogether, particularly in the developed world, with labor force participation rates falling “dramatically,” it said, “masking the true extent of the jobs crisis.”The ratio of employment-to-population ratio has fallen as much as four percentage points or more in some areas, it noted, and even where jobless rates have eased, the participation rate “has not yet recovered.”The labor organization also spotlighted youth unemployment, noting that there were 73.8 million young people unemployed worldwide. It estimated that an additional half million would join the ranks of the jobless this year. The youth unemployment rate, now 12.6 percent, will probably rise to 12.9 percent by 2017, the agency said.“The crisis has dramatically diminished the labor market prospects for young people,” the agency said, “as many experience long-term unemployment right from the start of their labor market entry, a situation that was never observed during earlier cyclical downturns.”The agency said employment tapered off in 2011 before turning negative in 2012, with four million people added to global unemployment rolls last year.But even countries in which jobless rates have not risen “often have experienced a worsening in job quality,” the organization said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/technology/huawei-springs-back-with-33-rise-in-net-profit.html,"BEIJING — Huawei Technologies, one of the largest makers of telecommunications equipment in the world, bounced back from a disappointing 2011 with a 33 percent rise in net profit for 2012 and forecast stronger revenue growth, buoyed by smartphone sales and cloud computing.Huawei’s chief financial officer, Cathy Meng, the daughter of the company’s founder, Ren Zhengfei, denied that U.S. security concerns would hamper the privately held company’s growth and said Monday that it would keep “an open mind” about a possible stock market listing.“Cloud computing is a huge sector in the next five years,” Ms. Meng told a results presentation. “In the telecom industry, we are expecting a 5 percent increase in capital investments. Smartphone penetration is still way too low and there is a lot of room for growth. So these three areas will create a lot of opportunities for us.”Huawei, which ranks behind only Ericsson of Sweden in telecommunications equipment, reported an unaudited net profit of 15.4 billion renminbi, or $2.5 billion, up from 11.6 billion renminbi in 2011, as new telecommunications projects and smartphones increased sales.Revenue for the year rose 8 percent to 220.2 billion renminbi.The results were in line with company guidance at the start of the year and came a day after ZTE, its rival, warned of a net loss of as much as 2.9 billion renminbi for 2012.Huawei is making gains in the enterprise business, which sells networking equipment like routers and switches and has up to now been dominated by Cisco Systems.Huawei, founded in 1987 by Mr. Ren, a former Chinese military officer, is known for aggressively gaining sales in the telecommunications equipment sector by edging out rivals like Alcatel-Lucent, Nokia Siemens Networks and ZTE.While Huawei has increased sales and gained market share in Europe, Africa and Asia, it has also run into obstacles in countries including the United States and Australia because of national security and cyberespionage concerns.The company has been barred from bidding for the rollout of a national broadband network in Australia, faces exclusion from the government network in Canada and is not allowed to sell telecommunications equipment to U.S. carriers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/higher-taxes-on-everyone-could-ease-spending-cuts.html,"What would happen if the government raised everybody’s taxes?The fiscal deal struck in the wee hours of 2013 will raise at best $700 billion from higher taxes on wealthy Americans in the coming decade. This is hardly enough to stabilize the nation’s debt in the next 10 years, let alone deal with a long-term budget deficit that is expected to mushroom as the population ages and spending on entitlements rises.To make ends meet, both parties agree, spending must be drastically cut. Under the White House budget proposal, discretionary spending on everything except the military is projected to shrink to its smallest share of the economy since the Eisenhower administration by the beginning of the next decade. Though he has resisted Republican demands to slash entitlements, President Obama remains willing to look for further savings from Medicare.This is not, however, the only option we have. There is an alternative: raising more money from all taxpayers, including the middle class.Nobody wants to talk about this. Republicans don’t want to raise taxes at all. “The tax issue is finished, over, completed,” declared the Senate minority leader, Mitch McConnell. President Obama does want to raise more money, but only narrowly. His proposals for tax reform are aimed carefully at high-income taxpayers and corporations.Yet Americans would benefit from a discussion of this possibility. Higher taxes would undoubtedly stress many working families, especially after a decade of falling income for all but the most successful. But these families might nonetheless prefer paying more in taxes to losing government services they rely on.A good way to start the debate might be to explain what higher taxes would entail for middle-class families, so they could balance the bill against the benefits they would otherwise lose. “One way or another, middle-class people are going to take a hit,” said Eric J. Toder, a co-director of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. “It’s unfortunate that neither party is willing to admit that.”The tax hit would depend, of course, on the size of the federal bill. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal-leaning research group, has suggested that after the fiscal deal, we need only $1.4 trillion in additional deficit reduction to stabilize the federal debt at about 73 percent of the economy over the next decade.That $1.4 trillion amounts to less than 1 percent of our economic output. But it would come on top of enormous cuts to civilian discretionary spending, from the National Institutes of Health to training programs for unemployed workers. What’s more, the center’s analysis stops in 2022, before the budget deficit is really expected to take off.We might consider instead the experience of other advanced countries, which raise more money in taxes than we do to pay for programs like child care for working mothers and government-financed health care for everybody.Taxes in the 34 nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development averaged about 34.5 percent of gross domestic product from 2004 to 2010, the latest year for which the organization provides data. That’s about 8.5 percentage points more than our federal, state and local taxes put together in the same period.Or we might try something between the two. In November 2011, before the White House and Congress raised taxes on the wealthy, the Tax Policy Center analyzed how the United States could reduce the debt burden using taxes alone, without resorting to deep cuts to entitlements or discretionary spending.Compared with a situation in which all of the Bush administration’s tax cuts were extended indefinitely and other government policies remained in place, the center estimated that we could trim the federal debt to 60 percent of gross domestic product, from about 70 percent, in two decades by increasing tax revenue by 4.1 percent of gross domestic product — some $650 billion last year.The average cost of this option for American taxpayers, according to the policy center, is substantial. But perhaps it is bearable: over the long term, beyond one-time adjustments, the after-tax income of the average American family would fall by 6.6 to 7.1 percent. This might be seen as the price tag for saving the government roughly as we know it.The burden could be distributed in several ways. In one possibility, the center estimated, the top federal income tax rate for the richest families, earning more than $398,600 a year, would rise to almost 54 percent, well above the 39.6 percent agreed to in the recent fiscal negotiations.The poorest Americans, earning $17,850 or less, would pay a top rate of 15.4 percent, up from 10 percent today. Middle-class families, earning $17,850 to $72,600, would see their top tax rate rise to 23.1 percent from 15 percent.This would distribute the burden fairly progressively, drawing a larger share of taxes from wealthier Americans. The top 1 percent of taxpayers would see their after-tax income drop 13.1 percent. The poorest fifth would only lose 0.4 percent of their income. Middle-income families would lose about 4.2 percent, on average — about $2,000 for a family earning $50,000 a year.But that’s not the only way to increase taxes. Most economists agree, in fact, that it is a costly method. High income tax rates blunt incentives to earn more, putting a drag on economic growth. Another option is to tax the money that people spend, using the kind of value-added tax employed in every other advanced country. The Tax Policy Center estimated that the government could hit its revenue targets with a broad V.A.T. of 16.7 percent.Such a tax would look like a sales tax, an extra charge on the purchase of goods and services. Because the poor spend a larger share of their money than the rich, however, it would fall more heavily on lower-income Americans.Even if the government were to offer a rebate to compensate the poorest among us, their after-tax income would decline 1.3 percent, according to the policy center’s analysis. The income of the top 1 percent would decline 7.6 percent. Families in the middle of the income distribution would lose 6 percent — $3,000 from an after-tax income of $50,000.Citizens of other advanced nations appear to believe that a richer array of government services is worth the price. Standard V.A.T. rates in almost every European country exceed that in the Tax Policy Center’s analysis. Europe’s social democracies compensate for the regressive nature of the tax by spending the money on benefits that are particularly valuable for the poor.Americans have historically been more hostile to taxation than citizens of other wealthy nations. Still, our elected officials’ refusal to discuss higher taxes may overstate our aversion. Respondents to a poll by the Pew Research Center in the fall of 2011 thought, almost two to one, that it was more important to avoid cuts in Social Security benefits than to avoid payroll tax increases.According to a CBS/New York Times poll last summer, 74 percent of Americans oppose shorter school days or more crowded classrooms, even if those measures would lower their tax bill significantly. And 82 percent oppose lower taxes if that means reducing the ranks of the police.Clearly, Americans value government services. We may welcome an opportunity to save them."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/wal-mart-toughens-fire-safety-rules-for-suppliers.html,"Facing criticism for selling garments made at a Bangladesh factory where 112 workers died in a fire last November, Wal-Mart Stores told its worldwide suppliers Tuesday that it was adopting tougher rules on fire safety at its contractors and would have “zero tolerance” for suppliers that used unauthorized subcontractors.At least two suppliers were using the Tazreen Fashions factory in Bangladesh to produce garments for Wal-Mart in the weeks before the fire there. After the fatal blaze, Wal-Mart said those suppliers had used the factory without its knowledge after it had stopped authorizing production there. It did not say why. Wal-Mart said it had ended its relationship with those two suppliers.In a letter sent to its suppliers on Tuesday, Wal-Mart said they must “fully and accurately disclose” in advance any factories they or any of their subcontractors plan to use. Under the policy, suppliers will be subject to termination even if an undisclosed factory is used “without the supplier’s knowledge” by anyone in the supplier’s supply chain. David Schilling, a program director at the Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility, praised the move, saying, “It’s an important step toward increased transparency and accountability of suppliers.”Wal-Mart also announced tougher requirements on fire safety, saying “facilities found to have fire safety-related violations must initiate corrective actions immediately.” The company said that the repairs must be completed no later than 30 days after the violations were identified.Three inspection reports that worker advocates found at the Tazreen factory after the fire showed that it had serious, continuing fire safety violations from May 2011 through April 2012.Wal-Mart also told its suppliers that if they want to use additional factories, those factories will be required to “prequalify,” meaning they must first pass ethical sourcing standards on fire safety and other criteria.Some labor rights groups said Wal-Mart’s new policy did not go nearly far enough.Scott Nova, executive director of the Worker Rights Consortium, a monitoring group financed by American universities, said: “There are giant gaps. There is no commitment on covering the costs of the fire safety repairs and renovations that we all know are necessary.”“There is also no real transparency,” he said. “There’s no way of knowing for two months, six months, a year, what the inspection reports find, and they won’t tell the workers the results of the inspections at their factories.”Brooke Buchanan, a Wal-Mart spokeswoman, said the company would publicize the names of factories dropped for noncompliance. But she said there were no plans to list or publicize the names of all the factories that Wal-Mart and its suppliers use — something that worker rights groups have advocated to make it easier to monitor factories.To help suppliers finance needed safety improvements, Wal-Mart is considering participating in a revolving fund that would provide loans to Bangladeshi factory owners, Ms. Buchanan said.The letter to suppliers was first reported Tuesday by The Wall Street Journal.Wal-Mart said all of its Bangladesh factories must have an “electrical and building safety assessment” by an independent, certified agency. Since 2005, factory fires in Bangladesh, many caused by electrical problems, have killed 600 workers.After the Tazreen fire, many surviving workers said the eight-story factory had barred windows that prevented workers from escaping. In its new rules, Wal-Mart said any barred windows must have an emergency mechanism to allow for escape.Wal-Mart also told its suppliers, “All floors and buildings, including dormitories, must have a secondary exit, and preferably an external fire escape route.”But Mr. Nova voiced dismay that Wal-Mart’s new policy did not explicitly require fireproof staircases or external fire escapes in multistory factories. “The failure to have such effective means to exit was an important reason so many workers died at Tazreen,” he said. Ms. Buchanan said she expected inspectors to call for such measures when visiting multistory factories.Dara O’Rourke, a specialist on labor policy at the University of California, Berkeley, praised Wal-Mart’s new requirement that fire safety violations be addressed immediately. “This is a critical step towards motivating factories to fix the problems they find in audits,” he said.Wal-Mart is also requiring factories to have proper access for fire trucks and firefighting equipment, and that suppliers have a worker in each country where they operate responsible for ensuring factory compliance."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/nyregion/cuomo-to-focus-on-limiting-spending-in-new-budget.html,"ALBANY — Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo proposed on Tuesday to balance the state budget with a combination of spending cuts, gambling revenue, and new or extended taxes and fees.Over all, the proposed $142.6 billion budget represents a 5.3 percent increase over the current one, but much of the increase will be covered by federal money provided for the recovery from Hurricane Sandy and the enactment of the health care law championed by President Obama. The increase in state operating funds would be held to 1.6 percent, if the Legislature approves the governor’s plan.The budget does not offer increased aid or sweeping policy changes to benefit the state’s ailing upstate cities, drawing criticism from even a close ally. Instead, the governor has proposed a task force to help cities restructure their finances and a new plan that would allow municipalities to push their pension costs into the future, the second such plan the state has produced in the last half-decade.“See, the answer cannot be, my friends, that every municipality in the state that has a financial problem, they’re going to come to Albany and ask for a check,” Mr. Cuomo, a Democrat, said in a speech to the Legislature on Tuesday. “We don’t have the money.”But Mayor Stephanie A. Miner of Syracuse, who was chosen by Mr. Cuomo to be co-chairwoman of the state’s Democratic Party, criticized that position. Upstate mayors have said in recent months that there should be a more comprehensive approach to helping cities restructure in the wake of crushing pension and health care costs coupled with a dwindling industrial base.“Clearly I would love to say to you that this solves, or starts to solve, Syracuse’s problems, but I can’t say that,” Ms. Miner said of the governor’s budget. “Today I have more questions than answers.”She expressed particular concern about the governor’s pension plan.“I don’t think borrowing is the most fiscally responsible way to approach this problem,” she said. “This problem has to be examined in a responsible way if we are to prevent municipalities from going over the fiscal cliff.”“Isn’t this what got states like Illinois in trouble?” she added.While the mayor’s comments were unusual — Democrats, in particular, have rarely questioned Mr. Cuomo — she was hardly the only one sounding a note of caution.Richard Brodsky, a former assemblyman who has been advising the City of Yonkers, said, “To entice local governments to borrow for operating expenses is going to exacerbate the looming fiscal crisis.”And State Senator Dean G. Skelos, the leader of his chamber’s Republican caucus, was cool to a proposal by the governor to increase the state’s hourly minimum wage to $8.75, from $7.25.“Anything can be in the budget, and anything can be taken out of the budget,” Mr. Skelos said, adding that Senate Republicans would seek new tax credits for businesses and would not support “doing something counterproductive to job creation.”But Mr. Skelos may not be able to halt the legislation; his caucus shares power with a breakaway faction of Democrats led by Senator Jeffrey D. Klein of the Bronx, who praised Mr. Cuomo for including the minimum-wage increase. “I believe it will get done,” Mr. Klein said.The state faces a budget gap of $1.35 billion in the fiscal year that starts April 1, a relatively modest amount by Albany standards; Mr. Cuomo’s budget would close that gap, as is required by state law.A number of tax and fee changes are in the governor’s plan, including a proposal to restrict drivers from pleading down speeding tickets while adding an $80 state surcharge to lesser traffic offenses. There would also be a new minimum fine of $50 for violating state laws related to sending text messages or using cellphones while driving. And Quick Draw lottery tickets would also become more widely available, raising more gambling revenue.Education spending would rise 4.4 percent under the plan, which includes money for new programs to help poorer districts offer extended school days and full-day prekindergarten programs.In the latest sign of the government’s reliance on debt, the governor proposed changing the way the State University of New York pays the debt service related to the construction, operation and maintenance of its 485 dormitories. The state has been close to reaching its debt limit, but the new payment method would mean the dormitory debt service was technically no longer considered state debt.One change is likely to cheer drivers: More Department of Motor Vehicles offices could open on Saturdays under the governor’s plan.Mr. Cuomo is also proposing to extend for three years a law limiting charitable deductions made by taxpayers with adjusted gross income over $10 million, and he wants New York companies to start paying taxes on royalty income. An assessment on electric, gas, water and steam utilities would be extended, raising $236 million in the new fiscal year — a cost likely to be passed on to ratepayers. Mr. Cuomo proposed a range of cuts sure to prompt debate, including deferring cost of living increases for health and human service providers.“The taxpayer’s pocket,” he said, “is not a bottomless piggy bank.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/us-trade-representative-will-step-down.html,"Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative, will step down in late February, his office said Tuesday. Lael Brainard and Michael Froman, two top administration aides on international economic policy, are considered among the front-runners to succeed him, people knowledgeable about trade policy said.“From bringing home new trade agreements with Korea, Colombia and Panama and negotiating to open up new markets for American businesses to cracking down on unfair trade practices around the world, he has been a tremendous advocate for the American worker,” President Obama said in a statement.The White House did not say when a successor would be named to the job, a cabinet-level position that advises the president on trade policy and negotiates trade agreements.The next trade representative will inherit a full slate of issues. The administration is negotiating a free-trade deal with nearly a dozen Pacific Rim nations, including Canada, Mexico, Australia, Vietnam and Singapore, though not the regional powers of China and Japan. It is also edging closer to free-trade talks with the European Union.Mr. Kirk, 58, a former mayor of Dallas, made clear last year that he intended to resign. In addition to losing another cabinet-level assistant, Mr. Obama is also losing a favored golf partner in Mr. Kirk.“We have made great strides to bring about the president’s vision of a more robust, responsible and responsive trade policy that opens markets to products stamped ‘Made in America’ and enforces Americans’ trade rights around the world,” Mr. Kirk said in a statement.Mr. Froman, 50, who has known Mr. Obama since they attended Harvard Law School together, holds a joint appointment at the White House National Security Council and National Economic Council. Ms. Brainard, also 50, an under secretary at the Treasury Department and a contender for secretary later in Mr. Obama’s second term, is the country’s top financial diplomat.Mr. Kirk, Mr. Froman and Ms. Brainard are attending the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, this week, according to an official list of participants."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/us/politics/post-office-losing-out-on-federal-contracts-report-finds.html,"WASHINGTON — Even the federal government turns to private shippers rather than the Postal Service when it wants to send packages.A report from the agency’s inspector general said that since 2001, private companies like FedEx and United Parcel Service had consistently captured 98 percent of the revenue from long-term shipping contracts with the government because the financially troubled Postal Service did not have a sales staff or a strategy to focus on the federal sector until 2009.The report said the Postal Service lost out on about $34 million in potential revenue over the last two years, a relatively small amount for an agency that reported $65 billion in revenue last year. But officials at the inspector general’s office said the Postal Service, which had a net loss of $15.9 billion last year, could not afford to pass up opportunities to generate revenues and profits no matter how small.“Every little bit helps,” said Agapi Doulaveris, a spokeswoman for the inspector general’s office. “The purpose of our audits are to help them identify ways to do things better. Every opportunity we identify helps adds to their bottom line.”The report, released on Friday, examined two years of shipping contracts made through the General Services Administration, which buys goods and services for the federal government.While federal shipping contracts totaled an estimated $336.9 million last year, the Postal Service earned only $4.8 million of that — less than 2 percent of the overall amount, the report found.The post office’s ability to compete in the federal shipping market is hampered by several factors besides its late entry, the report found, including an inability to guarantee two- to three-day delivery service and to be as flexible in setting prices as its competitors.Because of federal law, “the Postal Service cannot sell products below cost and make up the loss with other products or services to penetrate a market, attract new customers or match competitors’ prices,” the report found.Postal officials, who did not address why the agency entered the federal shipping market years after their private competitors, said they were addressing the problems raised in the report. But the findings underscored the challenges the agency faces as it tries to find new ways to increase revenue to offset a long-term decline in mail volume.Last year, the Senate passed a bill to overhaul the agency that would have provided retirement incentives for nearly 100,000 of the post office’s 547,000 workers. The bill would have also allowed the agency to study the elimination of Saturday delivery if it could not cut costs in two years; offer a broader range of services, like delivering beer and wine for retailers; and recoup more than $11 billion it had overpaid into a pension fund. The House never voted on the bill.In the meantime, the agency has taken steps to address its financial problems without Congressional approval. It has cut hours at hundreds of small, rural post offices, consolidated mail processing centers and reduced staffing levels.The Postal Service also plans to again raise the price of a first-class stamp by a cent, to 46 cents, this Sunday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/global/robin-hood-trading-tax-nudged-forward-by-europe.html,"BRUSSELS — A hotly contested tax on financial trades took a big step forward on Tuesday when European Union finance ministers allowed a vanguard of member states to proceed with the plan.The so-called Robin Hood tax would apply to trading in stocks, bonds and derivatives. Although the tax would probably be small — one-tenth of a percentage point or less on the value of a trade — it could earn billions of euros for struggling European governments.Algirdas Semeta, the European commissioner in charge of tax policy, called the decision “a major milestone in tax history” and said the levy could be imposed starting next year. But deep concerns about how it would work could still lead to delays.The European Commission, the bloc’s policy-making arm, still needs to draft the final legislation, and the 11 states in favor of the law will have to give their unanimous approval before it becomes law — two more than the minimum required for legislation to be drafted.A significant complication is opposition to the tax by Britain, which has the largest trading hub in Europe in the City of London. But because Britain has decided to stay outside the group of states applying the tax, its resistance would probably not stop the plan from moving ahead.Among the 27 members of the European Union, the proposal has firm backing from Germany, France and nine other countries. Others might eventually support the idea, which is closely associated with James Tobin, a United States economist and Nobel laureate who suggested a version of it in the 1970s.Although Britain would not be required to assess the tax, the law could still have an effect on its financial sector by raising the costs of transactions that involve institutions inside the tax zone.The decision to move forward with the tax was “regrettable and likely to serve as another brake on economic growth,” Richard Middleton, a managing director at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe, an industry group based in London, said on Tuesday.Backers of the tax originally expected the proceeds to go to humanitarian and environmental causes. But the debt crisis and difficulties in the banking sector have adjusted priorities. Governments are now keener to use the revenue to help prop up shaky banks and finance the European Union’s budget.If the plan were applied across the entire bloc, it could generate 57 billion euros annually, or about 0.5 percent of European Union’s output, according to the European Commission. But that amount is likely to be significantly less without Britain’s participation.The next stage is for Mr. Semeta, the European tax commissioner, to propose legislation. He has already suggested a tax of 0.1 percent of the value of stocks and bonds traded, and 0.01 percent of the value of derivatives trades.One challenge is formulating the law so it does not prompt traders to move outside taxed jurisdictions. Another is deciding who pays the tax when traders in cities like Frankfurt or Paris, where the tax would apply, conduct business with traders in cities like London or New York, where it would not.Tuesday was the second day of a meeting that began here Monday with a session of the finance ministers from the 17 members of the euro zone, known as the Eurogroup.On Monday evening, in a nearly unanimous vote, the group elected Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, as its new president."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/technology/ibm-continues-its-profit-growth.html,"For years, I.B.M. has delivered on a formula: strong earnings gains with scant revenue growth.The company continued the pattern on Tuesday, reporting solid profit on flat revenue in the last quarter of 2012. Its earnings performance exceeded Wall Street’s estimates, and even its revenue was a bit ahead of analysts’ forecasts.I.B.M. is the largest supplier of information technology — hardware, software and services — to corporations and government agencies worldwide, and its results are closely watched for signs of broader trends in business technology spending.Some analysts and investors had worried that slower growth in China, Europe’s continuing troubles and anxiety about the fiscal impasse in the United States might have chilled corporate investment in technology in the fourth quarter.But in I.B.M.’s report, and in a conference call with analysts, there was no suggestion of a drop at the end of the year. “For the most part, I.B.M.’s performance was pretty good,” said A. M. Sacconaghi, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein. “Relative to the worry that was out there, investors feel good about it.”In after-hours trading, the company’s stock rose as much as $8.72 a share, or 4.5 percent. It closed the regular session at $196.08, up $1.61 a share, or 0.83 percent.I.B.M.’s net income rose 6 percent, to $5.8 billion, in the fourth quarter. Its operating earnings per share rose 14 percent, to $5.39, well ahead of analysts’ average estimate of $5.25 a share, as compiled by Thomson Reuters.Revenue was $29.3 billion, compared with a Wall Street forecast of $29.1 billion. A year earlier, I.B.M. reported revenue of $29.5 billion, but that quarter included $239 million in revenue from the company’s computerized cash register business, which it sold to Toshiba TEC in 2012.In a conference call, Mark Loughridge, I.B.M.’s chief financial officer, called the quarter “very, very strong” and said it finished a year of record profit, earnings per share and cash flow.There were weak spots in the quarter. Revenue in the company’s big technology services business slipped 2 percent to $15 billion, but profit rose in the services divisions nonetheless.More than most technology suppliers, I.B.M. has moved aggressively into fast-growing markets abroad and into higher-margin products and services. These more profitable businesses typically combine hardware, software and industry expertise to, for example, help companies analyze vast amounts of data to find opportunities to cut costs and increase sales.Such tailored offerings are also sold to governments to manage traffic, reduce energy consumption and curb crime. They are products and services that I.B.M. has singled out for investment and growth, like its data analytics unit, which grew 13 percent in the quarter, and its so-called Smarter Planet group, which grew more than 25 percent.“These are complete solutions where I.B.M. has a competitive advantage,” said Josh Olson, an analyst at Edward Jones.More than half of the revenue in those high-growth businesses comes from software, where profit margins are highest, Mr. Loughridge said.Today, I.B.M. is known as much for its financial discipline as for its strategic acumen. For the last 15 years, it has averaged 2 percent revenue growth a year, while earnings per share have increased an estimated 11.5 percent annually, according to Sanford C. Bernstein.The company’s robust earnings performance, Mr. Sacconaghi said, has been accomplished largely through relentless cost-cutting and share buybacks.I.B.M. spent $12 billion last year to buy back its own shares. But Mr. Loughridge sought to deflect any notion that the buybacks came at the expense of investments in innovation and long-term growth, noting that since 2010, the company has spent $19 billion on research and development. “We’re plowing investments hand over fist into the business,” he said.The company’s hardware revenue slipped 1 percent, to $5.8 billion. The division’s sales were hurt by the loss of the cash register business. But mainframe sales surged 56 percent thanks to a new line of mainframe computers, the zEnterprise EC12, which began shipping in September.The software business grew 3.5 percent, to $7.9 billion, helping to bolster corporate profit margins. In the last three years, Mr. Loughridge said, I.B.M. has spent $11.5 billion on acquisitions, mostly on specialized software companies."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/sports/basketball/grizzlies-clear-cap-space-in-trade.html,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP) — The Memphis Grizzlies traded Marreese Speights, Wayne Ellington, Josh Selby and a future first-round draft pick Tuesday to the Cleveland Cavaliers for Jon Leuer.The trade is the first big move by the Grizzlies’ new ownership and clears about $6 million in salary in getting Memphis under the luxury tax threshold this season. The Grizzlies rank fourth in the West and are 6-4 over their past 10 games after the NBA’s best start this season.The deal gives the lottery-bound Cavs another first-round pick to improve a team entering Tuesday night’s home game against Boston with a 10-32 record — second-worst in the Eastern Conference. Speights also will help replace center Anderson Varejao who will miss the remainder of the season after developing a blood clot in his right lung.Varejao remains hospitalized at The Cleveland Clinic.The ownership group led by Robert Pera took over the Grizzlies on Nov. 5, and they had been scheduled to pay about $4 million in luxury tax this season with a payroll more than $74 million. This should help Memphis keep its starters Rudy Gay, Zach Randolph, Marc Gasol, Mike Conley and Tony Allen together the rest of this season for another postseason run.“It’s a trade that had to be made from a business decision, so we have a chance to keep our core together and we move forward,” Memphis coach Lionel Hollins said. “Hate to lose Mo and Wayne or Josh, but it’s part of the business of basketball and you have to do things. You have to make some tough decisions, and tough decisions were made and we live with them and move forward.”Speights is earning $4.2 million this season, while Ellington’s salary is $2 million. The Grizzlies also get a $6.4 million trade exception good for a year to help sign a free agent or use in a trade.“I’ve been blessed to play for a team and a city that has embraced me,” Speights, who had to agree to any trade, wrote on Twitter. “I will never forget the love and support I received from (hash)grizznation.”The 6-foot-10 Speights will help ease the loss of Varejao, who was leading the NBA in rebounding. Speights averaged 6.6 points and 4.7 rebounds as one of the Grizzlies’ top reserves but had been averaging only 14.5 minutes this season coming off the bench in Memphis. His contract expires after next season.Cleveland is trying to maintain salary-cap space and stay away from any maximum contracts so it can be active in free agency over the next two years. General manager Chris Grant has been doing all he can to attain assets to help the rebuilding, which is taking longer than expected.“Marreese will strengthen our front court, while Wayne and Josh will add depth to our back court,” Grant said in a statement. “At the same time, we are adding a valuable asset with another future first round pick, while also maintaining our future flexibility.”The Cavaliers also waived Jeremy Pargo to create room for the trade.The Grizzlies already owe a first-round draft pick to Minnesota, so the Cavaliers will get Memphis’ first-round selection after that. The selection is protected so Cleveland could only pick between Nos. 6 and 14 in 2015 with the pick protected only for the top five in 2017 and 2018.Ellington, picked up in a trade from Minnesota last July, helped Memphis beat Miami on Nov. 11 with a career-high seven 3-pointers and 25 points. But Ellington has hit only 34 3s in his other 39 games this season. Selby has played in only 10 games this season.Memphis gets 6-10 Leuer who is averaging 2.4 points in nine games. He was the 40th draft selection overall in 2011 by Milwaukee and was claimed off waivers by Cleveland in July. Leuer averaged 19.5 points and 12.3 rebounds playing with the Cavalier’s D-League team, the Canton Charge.But the Grizzlies will need to add at least a couple players to the roster quickly. They host the Lakers on Wednesday night. "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/technology/storm-and-pension-costs-leave-verizon-with-bigger-loss.html,"Verizon Communications is still adding plenty of customers and selling a lot of cellphones, but the impact of Hurricane Sandy and pension costs sank the company’s quarterly earnings.In November, the hurricane knocked out wireless service for all of the big carriers in the Northeast. But Verizon, based in New York, was hardest hit.The storm surge flooded its central offices in Lower Manhattan, Queens and Long Island, causing power failures, which disrupted a large portion of its old landline service in those areas. The company took about a week to restore most of its wireless service.“Sandy had a dramatic effect, particularly on the wire line business, due to the heavy concentration of damage in the New York metropolitan area,” said Francis J. Shammo, chief financial officer of Verizon, on the company’s earnings conference call. “Our challenge was to restore service to customers as quickly as possible, while still managing to meet the demand for new services.”The company reported on Tuesday a fourth-quarter loss of $4.22 billion, or $1.48 a share, more than double the loss a year ago. Damage from the hurricane cost 7 cents a share, and pension charges reduced earnings by $1.55 a share, Verizon said. Without those charges, the company would have earned 45 cents a share, lower than the 50 cents predicted by analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters.Revenue climbed to $30.05 billion, a 5.7 percent increase from a year ago, and slightly higher than estimates.Verizon said its wireless business, a joint venture with Vodafone of Britain, had a strong quarter. It sold 9.8 million smartphones, compared with 7.7 million in the same quarter a year ago, and added 2.1 million contract subscribers, the most valuable type of customer, versus 1.2 million a year ago.The iPhone was Verizon’s top-selling smartphone in the quarter, with 6.2 million sales — almost half of which were the iPhone 5, the latest model of the phone. The strong number suggests that demand for Apple’s smartphone is not weakening, despite previous reports that Apple had reduced orders for iPhone parts because sales were slower than expected.Android phones made up a majority of Verizon’s remaining smartphone sales. Verizon said sales of Windows phones had steady but slow growth.Chetan Sharma, an independent mobile analyst who does consulting for carriers, said it was impressive that Verizon Wireless continued to post strong phone sales while expanding its customer base. Its phone plans are generally more expensive than the competition’s, and growth of the business shows that customers have faith in Verizon’s network technology, Mr. Sharma said.Verizon is leading the race to build out its fourth-generation network, called LTE, which is faster and more efficient than its predecessor. The company has deployed LTE in 476 cities; AT&T, the second-biggest American carrier, is second with 135 cities.“The investment they’ve made in the network is showing,” Mr. Sharma said. “When consumers think of changing operators or upgrading, they’re choosing Verizon because of what they’ve experienced, as well as what they’ve heard about the network in terms of reliability across the country.”This year is shaping up to be another strong one for Verizon. Its new shared data plans, which allow customers to pay for one pool of data and share it across multiple smartphones, tablets and laptops, are helping it bring in more money from subscribers over all. Average monthly revenue from each account grew 6.6 percent to $146.80 in the fourth quarter. Already, 23 percent of Verizon’s accounts are on shared data plans.The faster the network, the faster people will use their data allowance and eventually buy more. On top of that, data is getting cheaper for Verizon to deliver. The company says the 4G LTE network is five times more efficient than its predecessor, 3G. That means the more people who buy devices that connect to the newer network, like the iPhone 5, the more money the company will eventually gain.“As more customers choose 4G LTE smartphones and devices, we expect the continued migration of data traffic from 3G to our lower-cost 4G LTE network will drive further improvements in operating and capital efficiency in 2013 and beyond,” Mr. Shammo said in the earnings call.This month, Research in Motion is expected to release its BlackBerry 10 smartphones. Mr. Shammo said Verizon was hopeful that the new phones would be successful.“We have very loyal BlackBerry users in our base, and we will see how that goes,” he said. “I think more choice for our customers is better for us and for the consumer and for competition.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/global/japanese-central-bank-in-forceful-move-to-fight-deflation.html,"Another central bank, another round of unconventional monetary policy.Following the lead of their counterparts in the United States, Japan’s central bankers announced Tuesday what they called a groundbreaking effort to reinvigorate the country’s long-moribund economy and defeat deflation.With no more room left to cut interest rates and previous steps unsuccessful, the Bank of Japan is taking a page from the Federal Reserve’s playbook and will pump trillions more yen into the economy by directly buying government bonds and other assets. It also doubled the country’s official inflation target to 2 percent. The action came after months of intense pressure on the Bank of Japan from the country’s audacious new prime minister, Shinzo Abe, to take more aggressive action to bolster the economy.But as in the United States, there are doubts about just how much of an effect the move will have in Japan. Three rounds of asset purchases since the onset of the financial crisis have successfully headed off deflation in the American economy but failed to generate the kind of growth necessary to return employment to prerecession levels.Japan’s move is also likely to further devalue the yen in the long term — causing some to worry about a possible round of competitive devaluations as countries weaken their currencies to bolster growth in exports. On Tuesday, however, the yen actually rose against the dollar and the euro amid disappointment that the Bank of Japan’s efforts had not gone far enough.Traditionally, curbing inflation, not worrying about deflation, has been the principal task of central bankers. But when economies enter prolonged periods of slow growth, or even contraction, other concerns come to the fore. Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, was keenly aware of Japan’s long-running struggle with deflation as well as the American experience in the Great Depression when he began the first round of United States asset purchases, or quantitative easing, in November 2008.After a second round of quantitative easing beginning in November 2010, the Fed started a third round in September. It said in December that it would continue to purchase $85 billion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities each month until the job market improved. After considerable pressure, European central bankers also began moving more aggressively last year, vowing to do “whatever it takes” to keep the euro zone from fracturing.Given the scale of the efforts in the United States and Europe, many experts were disappointed by the Bank of Japan’s action because the expanded asset purchases will not begin until 2014. They complained that was a waste of valuable time in turning around an economy whose descent into deflation has become a test case of the effects of doing too little in the face of an economic slowdown.To make matters worse, the Bank of Japan’s new plan to purchase 10 trillion yen, or $112 billion, in assets each month sounds more aggressive than it actually will be, said Gustavo Reis, senior international economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. That is because many of the securities the Bank of Japan will be purchasing are in the form of short-term debt that will quickly mature, so the additional purchases will equal about $112 billion a year — not a month — beginning in 2014.By contrast, he said, the Fed’s balance sheet is expected to expand by a trillion dollars in 2013.“The Bank of Japan should be more aggressive,” Mr. Reis said. “It’s a step forward, but given where their economy is, they need to do more.”In fact, with such a small annual increase in asset purchases, it is unlikely Japan will achieve 2 percent inflation, analysts said. The Consumer Price Index for 2012 fell 0.5 percent, according to government statistics. The Bank of Japan’s announcement “will likely disappoint those who expected the policy board to answer Abe’s call for a ‘different kind of B.O.J. policy,’ or significantly ramp up its pace of easing,” Izumi Devalier, an economist with HSBC, said in a note to clients.While certainly better than inaction, there is evidence that unconventional monetary policy can only do so much to lift overall economic growth.The Fed’s monetary policy seems to be having a much more significant effect on asset prices than it has on the underlying economy, said Larry Kantor, head of research at Barclays. He noted that nearly four years after markets hit bottom in March 2009, stocks in the United States had more than doubled in value. By contrast, “most people would characterize the economic recovery as weak.”For all the challenges in the United States and Europe, Japan’s economy, the world’s third largest, has been depressed for much longer; the 1990s are regarded as a “lost decade,” and the last 10 years are proving to be not much better. Deflation, an all-around fall in prices, profit and incomes, has plagued the country since the late 1990s.Since last year, when Mr. Abe was still opposition leader, he has urged the central bank to do more after previous rounds of asset purchases failed to reverse deflation. He stepped up the pressure on the bank after a landslide victory by his Liberal Democratic Party in parliamentary elections in December, which catapulted him to office for the second time since a short-lived stint in 2006-7.Mr. Abe’s call for the Bank of Japan to increase the monetary supply has weakened the yen, a boon for exporters, which are responsible for much of Japan’s growth. Earlier this month, Mr. Abe also announced an emergency stimulus of 12 trillion yen, providing even more tail wind for the Japanese economy. Those steps have pushed the Nikkei stock index 20 percent higher since mid-November, when Mr. Abe first campaigned on his expansionary platform.In a joint statement with the government, the Bank of Japan said it was doubling its inflation target to 2 percent and said it would “pursue monetary easing and aim to achieve this target at the earliest possible time.” The bank’s board voted to keep its benchmark interest rate at a range of zero to 0.1 percent. The bank also updated its estimates for economic growth in fiscal 2012 and 2013. The bank now forecasts growth of 1 percent for 2012 and 2.3 percent for 2013, with the increase taking into account the new measures.Mr. Abe immediately hailed the bank’s moves, telling the Bank of Japan governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, that the measures were “groundbreaking,” according to Kyodo News.Mr. Abe’s critics, however, warn that the central bank will become a printing press for profligate government spending — expenditures that carry great risks for a country whose public debt is already twice the size of its economy. Critics also say that before flooding a broken system with money, Japan must first tackle structural problems that hurt economic efficiency.Mr. Abe maintains that deflation will undermine any efforts to grow, and that the government and central bank must act together to get prices rising again. But in a nod to critics, the joint statement said the government would also promote “all possible decisive policy actions for reforming the economic structure” and establish “a sustainable fiscal structure.”“I believe we are firmly on the path toward bold monetary easing,” Mr. Abe told reporters."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/global/japan-reports-a-78-billion-trade-deficit-for-2012.html,"TOKYO — Japan on Thursday reported a record annual trade deficit in 2012, the second straight year in the red for an exporting nation that has long built its wealth on its vast trading surpluses.The annual trade gap of 6.93 trillion yen (about $78 billion) was brought about by surging fuel imports and a continued slide in machinery shipments and other mainstay exports. The deficit underscores the challenges Prime Minister Shinzo Abe faces as he tries to lift the world’s third-largest economy after the United States and China out of years of stagnation.The deficit also brings to the forefront the risks that accompany Mr. Abe’s bid to revive the economy through government spending, which will add to Japan’s public debt, already more than twice the size of its economy. For years, export surpluses helped Japan finance that enormous debt without having to turn to foreign investors.But that delicate balance is now unraveling. The global economic crisis set off a fall in Japanese exports, and also caused the yen to strengthen, weighing on the country’s competitiveness and recovery. The prolonged shuttering of the country’s nuclear reactors in the wake of the Fukushima crisis has led to a spike in Japan’s imports of oil and gas. A bitter territorial spat with China has hurt exports to Japan’s biggest trading partner.The provisional data released by the Finance Ministry on Thursday showed exports continued to fall in December at a faster pace than forecast by economists, despite a weakening of the yen that should have come as a boon to exporters.Still, economists expect trade to pick up as Japan’s economic recovery gathers momentum later this year.According to the data, Japan’s annual trade deficit jumped by 170 percent from the 2.56 trillion yen shortfall it recorded in 2011 to 6.93 trillion yen. Energy imports, mainly from the Middle East, surged, machinery and car exports fell across the board. By region, Japan’s exports to China tumbled by 10.8 percent, leaving Japan with a trade deficit of 3.52 trillion yen (about $40 billion) with its rising neighbor. Exports to the struggling European Union also fell by 15 percent.Trade with the United States was brisk, however, with exports climbing 11.7 percent and imports by 2.5 percent for a 5.1 trillion yen (about $58 billion) surplus. Japanese automakers did particularly well in the United States last year, rebounding from production cuts brought about by Japan’s 2011 tsunami."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/global/boeing-787-battery-was-not-overcharged-japanese-investigators-say.html,"In December 2006, the Federal Aviation Administration allowed Airbus, the European plane maker, to use 14-ounce lithium-ion batteries to provide standby power for the emergency lighting system of its new A380 jumbo jet.Ten months later, the agency allowed Boeing to use the same volatile type of battery on its new 787 plane. But in Boeing’s case, the batteries weighed 63 pounds each, were to be used in critical flight systems as well as to provide backup power, and would be charged and discharged much more often. Yet the agency’s ruling used identical language — it could have been just cut and pasted — in laying out the broad safeguards for using the batteries that it had given Airbus to follow.The use of lithium batteries in the 787 is at the center of the difficulties involving Boeing. The plane maker has staked its reputation on the success of the 787, an aircraft it nicknamed the Dreamliner. All 50 787s delivered to airlines worldwide were grounded last week until investigators in the United States and Japan find out why two lithium batteries failed in recent weeks, causing a fire on one 787 and damage to another that led to an emergency landing.It also raises fundamental questions about how federal regulators certify new technology and how they balance advances in airplane design and engineering with ensuring safety in commercial flying. In addition to finding out what went wrong, these issues will be examined in a federal investigation and at future Senate hearings.When it approved Boeing’s request in 2007, the F.A.A. said it had limited experience with the use of lithium-ion batteries in commercial airplanes, though it acknowledged that the batteries themselves were more prone to fire than traditional nickel-cadmium or lead-acid batteries.Still, the agency approved the technology on the assumption that Boeing could make the batteries work and that computer controls could prevent batteries from overcharging or overheating. The agency also specified that any fire or toxic leak be contained and not damage any surrounding electrical systems.At the same time, the agency brushed off concerns raised in 2006 and 2007 by the Air Line Pilots Association that a fire in flight would be difficult to extinguish and that flight crews should be given extra training.“We have concluded that providing a means for controlling or extinguishing a fire — such as stopping the flow of fluids, shutting down equipment, or fireproof equipment” was an “adequate alternative to requiring the flight or cabin crew to use extinguishing agents,” the agency said in its 2006 decision about the Airbus A380.Experts said that regardless of the cause of the 787’s problems, the charred remains of the battery that caught fire earlier this month in a plane in Boston raised the question of whether the safeguards functioned properly.On Wednesday, the National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the battery fire in Boston, said that all eight cells in the battery had sustained “varying degrees of thermal damage.” Six of them have been scanned and disassembled for further examination.Many battery experts said they viewed Boeing’s decision to use lithium-ion batteries as a reasonable one and pointed out that lithium-ion batteries had also been used in expensive space satellites since around 2000 without serious problems. They said that track record would have added to the confidence Boeing and federal regulators had about using them in commercial airliners.Jay F. Whitacre, an associate professor of engineering at Carnegie Mellon University, said GS Yuasa, the Japanese company that built the 787 batteries, told the National Aeronautics and Space Administration in a 2008 presentation that it had already supplied batteries for six satellites and had contracts for 50 more. GS Yuasa also said that its satellite batteries had never had a shorting incident in more than 10 years of production.“That’s pretty compelling,” Professor Whitacre said. “If I had all that data and saw that they were making batteries for 50 more satellites, I’d say that was a reasonable risk to take. My sense is that Boeing did a fairly decent job of picking the right company.”But another battery expert, Donald Sadoway, a materials chemistry professor at M.I.T., disagreed. He said that sticking with an older type of battery instead of the lighter lithium battery would not have made a huge difference to the 787, adding about 40 pounds, or the equivalent of an extra suitcase per battery.“So you will risk the plane for something that’s tantamount to one guy’s suitcase?” Mr. Sadoway said. “Who’s making the calculation here? It’s absurd. It doesn’t add up.”With plane makers pushing the envelope on new technology, safety experts have questioned whether federal regulators had the expertise or the manpower to properly oversee those developments.Michael P. Huerta, the F.A.A.’s administrator, on Wednesday defended his agency’s handling of the process as well as its expertise to assess new technology in airplanes. The agency, he said, also has the ability to call in outside experts, if needed. He added that federal regulators would not lift the 787’s grounding order until they had fully reviewed its critical systems and understood why the batteries had failed.“Aviation from its very beginning has stretched technological boundaries,” Mr. Huerta told reporters. “For more than five decades, the F.A.A. has compiled a proven track record of safely introducing new technology and new aircraft.”He added, “We have the ability to establish rigorous safety standards and to make sure that aircraft meet them.”Lithium-ion batteries have many advantages over traditional batteries. They are lighter, can be recharged faster and more often, and provide substantially more power than other batteries of the same size.For that reason, lithium-ion cells have become the norm in rechargeable consumer electronics. But in 2006, manufacturing defects in some batteries that caused them to catch fire led computer makers to recall nearly 10 million laptopsSafety regulators, however, were more worried about the instances when the batteries caught fire in the cargo hold of an aircraft, or while being carried by passengers. Federal authorities in 2004 prohibited nonrechargeable lithium-ion batteries from being transported aboard passenger planes as cargo. That ruling was reinforced in August 2007, just two months before the Boeing request was approved.There were 132 safety problems involving batteries carried by passengers or in cargo holds from March 1991 to October 2012, according to the F.A.A.Professor Whitacre of Carnegie Mellon said that even though laptop battery packs were banned as loose cargo, that did not mean that lithium-ion batteries could not be used safely when integrated into the plane’s electrical system with computerized controls and other measures.F.A.A. officials said they oversaw Boeing’s laboratory tests of the new batteries. Boeing has said that its military business had begun a program to select lithium-ion batteries for its satellites in 2003 and that its engineers felt they understood the potential hazards.Mike Sinnett, Boeing’s top engineer on the 787 program, said recently that the company had built a system with multiple layers of protection that it thought would keep the batteries from overheating and contain any problem.The computerized controls are supposed to shut down the battery if it develops a problem, and the battery is supposed to keep a short in any one of its eight cells from spreading to the others. If any fumes or flames escape, Boeing said, the pressurized air system will help keep smoke out of the cabin and vent it outside.But neither the F.A.A. nor Boeing made any changes with the 787 when Cessna replaced the lithium-ion batteries on its CJ4 business jet with nickel-cadmium ones after a battery fire in October 2011, three weeks before the first 787 made its inaugural airline flight.“It is reasonable to understand their risk and put in engineering design to make up for these risks,” said Jeffrey P. Chamberlain, a battery expert at the Argonne National Laboratory. “I will remind you that the wings are full of jet fuel. And the same thing for the car you drive all day. In general, when you adopt a new technology, is it good to account for risk. The reverse would be terrifying.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/smallbusiness/tips-for-companies-that-want-to-sell-in-china.html,"Like many American businesses fighting to keep their prices competitive, Vision Quest Lighting turned to China about six years ago. It now imports about a sixth of the two dozen to three dozen parts required to make its lighting fixtures from there. Recently, however, the Long Island company began to see China in a different light: as a sales target. The growing economy of the world’s most populous nation made it ripe for Vision Quest’s architectural lighting fixtures, many custom-made for hotel and restaurant chains like Hilton and KFC.When one such client, a clothing retailer, ordered 1,500 lights for five stores, Vision Quest’s chief executive, Larry Lieberman, decided it made sense to start manufacturing lights in China. Other American clients, he reasoned, would no doubt begin placing similar orders as their chains sought to capitalize on the world’s fastest-growing consumer market. And with high-quality products from the West coveted in China, Mr. Lieberman also imagined his products on display in Chinese showrooms.And yet, selling goods in China is not easy. Mr. Lieberman made the 1,500 lights only to see them gather dust in a warehouse in Guangzhou for more than four weeks because he had not yet established a local enterprise approved to process sales.“The customer couldn’t pick up the goods because we were still trying to set up something so they could buy them correctly and pay the right tax,” he said.With help from an experienced consultant, Mr. Lieberman finessed the impasse by selling through an established local company, and he remains bullish on cracking the Chinese market — as do many other small-business owners. After all, China, according to a 2012 McKinsey & Company report, From Mass to Mainstream, will be the world’s largest growth market for many years.This small-business guide offers tips for getting started based on the experiences of entrepreneurs and small businesses that have already tried.BILINGUAL IS NOT BICULTURAL Lou Hoffman is founder and chief executive of the Hoffman Agency in San Jose, Calif., a communications consulting company that generates more than 50 percent of its revenue in Asia. Mr. Hoffman planted his flag in China in 1999.“I thought I was in not just another country but another universe,” he said. “It starts with the language, but goes much deeper. We couldn’t do business on the phone or by fax. Placing our first classified ad took 14 hours. We had to do everything in person, and considering the traffic in Beijing, you could kill three hours so someone could see your face.”Instead of dispatching a lieutenant from his California headquarters to open a satellite office in Beijing, Mr. Hoffman delayed expansion for nearly a year.Instead, he hired a Chinese national and embedded her in his San Jose office for 10 months so she could learn his agency’s culture, then carry it home with her. “We wanted someone able to interview people in their native tongue and able to bridge the cultures, which she was able to do,” Mr. Hoffman said.SET UP SHOP AS A WFOE Although it is possible to scout opportunities with a so-called rep office and to do business in China by selling through distributors or by licensing products to a Chinese company, most American businesses that are serious about selling in China invest the time and money to establish themselves as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, or what is known as a WFOE (pronounced WOOF-ee). “We do probably 100 WFOEs for every rep office,” said Dan Harris,  a lawyer with the Seattle firm Harris & Moure who writes a blog about Chinese law and business. “Legal fees for company formation, trademark and employee contracts and manuals typically run around $30,000 to $45,000.”But the upfront investment does not stop there. Depending on the location and the type of business, the Chinese government has minimum capital requirements — money deposited in a Chinese bank account — that can range “from $15,000 to millions of dollars,” he saidAnd think months, not weeks, to get all of the paperwork approved. “In China, you can’t do anything last minute,” said Savio S. Chan, president and chief executive of U.S. China Partners, which is based in Great Neck, N.Y., and which helped Vision Quest move its light fixtures out of regulatory limbo. “It can easily take up to six months to set up a WFOE.”LET OTHERS OPEN THE DOOR Cabot Hosiery Mills, which makes high-end recreational socks in Northfield, Vt., has edged into the Chinese market. Sought out by a Chinese distributor at an American trade show, the company has traded a bit of profit potential to test the demand for its made-in-America goods without wrangling a WFOE or staffing a sales operation.“Right now, it’s very straightforward and still small, less than 1 percent of our volume,” said Ric Cabot, chief executive of the company, which owns the Darn Tough Vermont brand. “But if it gets to the point where we see we’re leaving too much money on the table, we might consider doing something different.”DON’T GET KNOCKED OFF Product infringement and knockoffs are risks in China. As a result, Earl Kluft, owner of E.S. Kluft & Company in Rancho Cucamonga, Calif., a maker of luxury mattresses priced from $3,500 to $70,000, watched his first attempt to tap into the Chinese hunger for premium Western brands fall apart.“A huge manufacturer of recliners and small mattresses came to us, and we started a program under their name,” Mr. Kluft said, explaining that the arrangement started with six mattress products named for American cities. But on successive trips to China, he started to see fewer of his products on display — and more of other brands that looked very much like his.“Even after we stopped selling to them, they still had my picture up,” he said. Networking through a friend, Mr. Kluft has since signed a deal with a Chinese division of an Indonesian company that cautiously re-established a sales channel with minimal upfront investment. “The idea is to get this up and running,” he said. “We charge them a royalty, so much a year for use of our name in their stores, and they buy the product at a special discount.”Mr. Harris, the lawyer, advises getting started by finding reliable partners on the ground. “Find them through people you know, and then pay for whatever due diligence is necessary to make sure that you have made the right choice,” he said. “And do all of this before you start doing business with them.”LOOK LOCALLY BEFORE LEAPING For some entrepreneurs, help may be surprisingly close at hand. Many states — including Georgia, Pennsylvania, Mississippi and Tennessee — have international trade programs that offer counsel.“We think it’s hard for a small company who’s never been to China to figure this out all by themselves,” said Samar Ali, assistant commissioner of international affairs in Tennessee. “We’ll help them see if there’s a need for their product in China and to think it through: Do they need to set up a WFOE? Do they need to have a presence or not? Should they go the e-commerce route? And tell them how much they should budget going forward.”The assistance includes the use of Tennessee’s China offices for meetings with potential partners and help with business-to-business matchmaking through companies the international trade program has vetted in the 10 largest Chinese cities.Though bullish on the opportunities, Ms. Ali finds herself repeating mantras like: “Don’t go in too fast. Don’t go in blind. And don’t leave your common sense at home.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/garden/market-ready-tips-on-baseboards-and-moldings.html,"Q. Our house has wood trim with an orangy varnish in most of the rooms. Should we paint or refinish it before putting the house on the market, or leave it as is?A. Although the color of baseboards and moldings might seem like a relatively minor detail, making them look as clean and crisp as possible may help with the sale. “As neutral as possible is the way to go,” said Ann Cutbill Lenane, a managing director at Douglas Elliman Real Estate in Manhattan. “Woodwork, unless it’s in beautiful shape, oftentimes darkens an apartment. Lightening it up is usually the best thing to do.”In the case of orange varnish, “making an investment in a simple cover-up,” Ms. Lenane said, would be the most obvious solution. “Don’t get into restoring or really putting much money into it; it’s all about lightening the space,” she said, and white paint is usually the best way to do that.Michael Herold, an interior designer in Lambertville, N.J., agreed that the color of trim can influence the way your home is perceived. “Trim is definitely an important design element that sometimes gets overlooked,” he said. “Orangy varnish is something I’d correct — it can have an unappealing effect.”Mr. Herold also suggested painting the trim, rather than trying to restore a natural wood finish. As for color, white would work, he said, “but it can also get very boring.” That’s why he often opts for high-gloss black paint instead.“In my opinion, black can be considered a neutral,” he said. “It gives you drama without a color that might be unappealing to someone. It can work in a modern home, as well as a traditional environment.”Whatever color you choose, Mr. Herold recommended using the glossiest paint you can find. One of his favorite products is Glidden Trim and Door paint, which has a gel-like consistency. “When you’re done, you have this extremely shiny, almost mirrorlike finish that’s incredible,” he said. Another favorite is Farrow & Ball’s Full Gloss paint. “It has a lacquerlike finish that’s very durable and beautiful on trim work,” he said.Maintain one color across all the baseboards and moldings, and the doors as well, he advised, so “it all ties together.”If you’re planning to do the painting yourself, Mr. Herold recommended that you begin by sanding the varnish by hand, to get into all the grooves of the woodwork. But there’s no need to completely strip the varnish. “You just want to roughen it up so the paint will adhere,” he said.Then apply a layer of primer and, finally, add your finishing paint. “It sounds like a lot of work, but it’s something that can be completed in a few days,” he said. “And it will have a huge impact.” Questions about repairs or redecorating in preparation for putting a home on the market may be sent to marketready@nytimes.com.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/global/japan-raises-expectations-as-abes-policies-take-hold.html,"TOKYO — Japan raised its expectations for the economy for the first time in eight months Wednesday, as private consumption held firm and business sentiment improved in a sign that Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s policy of easy money and big spending had begun taking effect.Improvement in exports and recent steps to stimulate the economy are likely to help the economy recover, but a slowdown in overseas economies remains a risk, the government said in its monthly economic report.Mr. Abe, who led his Liberal Democratic Party to a landslide election victory in December, has called for aggressive monetary easing — manipulation of interest rates and money supply — and heavy spending to beat persistent deflation, helping to drive down the yen and lifting share pricesThe government also said it expected the Bank of Japan to take bold steps to meet an inflation goal of 2 percent as part of a bold push to escape deflation and to revive the economy.“The economy is weak, but signs of bottoming out can be seen in some areas,” the report said.That was an improvement from last month, when the government said the outlook was weakening because of a slowdown in overseas economies.Mr. Abe’s cabinet approved a stimulus package of ¥10.3 trillion, or $116.3 billion, this month, while the Bank of Japan, in its most determined effort yet to end years of economic stagnation, decided Tuesday to switch to an open-ended commitment to buying assets next year and doubling its inflation target to 2 percent.Japan’s economics minister, Akira Amari, said the improved outlook reflected the positive effects a softer yen and firmer stock prices were having on corporate sentiment.Hiroaki Muto, economist at Sumitomo Mitsui Asset Management, agreed.“The yen has depreciated by about 10 percent thanks to Abenomics, and expectations are running high,” Mr. Muto said, using a popular term for the prime minister’s policies.In the report, the government raised its expectation for private consumption for the second month in a row, saying consumer spending was holding firm.“Auto sales bottomed in October and were on the rise in November and December. …Car production is recovering as well. Private consumption is showing signs of bottoming out,” said a cabinet official who had compiled the report but was not authorized to speak on the record.“Corporate leaders’ views on business conditions are recovering against the backdrop of a recent correction to the yen’s appreciation and gains in share prices,” said the official.The risk that overseas developments will hurt the Japanese economy had diminished, he added, as the U.S. government averted setting off automatic spending cuts and tax increases, and Japan appeared to be past the worst of its diplomatic fight with China over a small chain of islands in the East China Sea. The dispute resulted in a temporary boycott of Japanese goods in China."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/mcdonalds-forecasts-a-decline-in-january-restaurant-sales.html,"McDonald’s on Wednesday forecast a decline in global restaurant sales for January, as it and other fast-food chains fight for customers who are spending cautiously during continued economic uncertainty.The world’s biggest restaurant company also reported an unexpected rise in December sales at established American outlets, which helped lift its fourth-quarter profit above analysts’ estimates.The company reported that its fourth-quarter net income rose 1.4 percent to $1.4 billion, or $1.38 a share. That topped analysts’ average forecast of $1.33 a share, according to Thomson Reuters. Total sales rose 1.9 percent to $6.95 billion.Wall Street expected early 2013 to be tough for McDonald’s as it runs short of quick fixes for its business in the United States, and bumps up against strong year-earlier results that were bolstered by unseasonably warm weather.McDonald’s forecast for a decline in this month’s global sales at restaurants open more than a year suggests a “pretty clear drop-off between December and January,” a Morningstar analyst, R. J. Hottovy, said.Global same-restaurant sales were flat in December, although McDonald’s experienced an unexpected 0.9 percent rise in the United States, its second-largest market in revenue behind Europe.The company’s push to keep more restaurants open on Christmas Day and its shift of the limited-time offering of the popular McRib sandwich to December from October bolstered the December results in the United States.Analysts polled by Consensus Metrix had expected those sales to drop 1.78 percent.McDonald’s expects near-term top and bottom-line growth to remain under pressure in part because the company must top strong results from a year earlier, the company’s chief executive, Don Thompson, said in a conference call with analysts.Last year’s global sales at McDonald’s restaurants open at least 13 months increased 6.7 percent for January and 7.3 percent for the first quarter.Fast-food chains like Burger King Worldwide Inc. and Yum Brands’ Taco Bell have introduced new menus in the United States and are doing a better job of competing with McDonald’s.At the same time, American consumers have less money in their pockets since the end of the payroll tax cut.“We suspect choppy demand trends and the impact of the loss of the payroll tax deduction are in part to blame” for the company’s downbeat guidance, a Lazard Capital Markets analyst, Matthew DiFrisco, said in a note to clients.To remain competitive, McDonald’s stepped up promotion of its value menus — like the Dollar Menu. That effort has put pressure on profitability, raising concern among analysts."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/opinion/how-to-get-high-speed-internet-to-all-americans.html,"ON Monday, President Obama said that during his second term, Americans would act together to “build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores” and that “we cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries — we must claim its promise.”The president is right that digital communication networks — especially high-capacity fiber networks reaching American homes and businesses — can be a powerful economic engine. But we are far away from being able to realize that vision, even as we cede the advantage such technology offers to other countries.Although Julius Genachowski, the chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, has challenged the country to build additional gigabit fiber networks — about 100 times faster than most residential connections today — his words won’t advance our digital future unless they are backed up with the leadership necessary to enact pro-growth, pro-innovation and competition-enabling rules.At the heart of the problem lie a few powerful companies with enormous influence over policy making. Both the wireless and wired markets for high-speed Internet access have become heavily concentrated, and neither is subject to substantial competition nor oversight. Companies like Time Warner Cable routinely get their way when they seek to prevent local officials from encouraging competition. At the federal level, Verizon Wireless is keeping the F.C.C. in court arguing over the scope of its regulatory powers — a move that has undermined the agency’s authority.As a result, prices are too high and speeds too slow. A third of Americans opt not to buy high-speed Internet access at home, often because they can’t afford it.Incumbents like Comcast and Verizon Wireless (now cooperating in a joint marketing venture) claim that their market is characterized by robust competition. But where is the competition when 94 percent of new wired high-speed customers bought service from their local cable distributors during the third quarter of 2012? Not surprisingly, America lags behind almost every other industrialized country in high-speed access — even France, the bête noir of American free-marketeers, has better and cheaper Internet access.There’s little question that our wired (Comcast and Time Warner Cable) and wireless (AT&T and Verizon Wireless) giants need to be reined in. We need reasonably priced, globally competitive, ubiquitous communications infrastructure so that Americans can compete and innovate.To get there, the federal government needs to pursue three goals. First, it must remove barriers to investment in local fiber networks. Republican and Democratic mayors around the country are rightly jealous of the new, Google-built fiber network in Kansas City, Mo., which is luring start-ups from across the country. And yet in nearly 20 states, laws sponsored by incumbent network operators have raised barriers for cities wanting to foster competitive networks.In response, Congress must act to restore local communities’ right to self-determination by pre-empting these unfair and anticompetitive state laws. We must also create infrastructure banks that provide long-term, low-interest financing to support the initial costs of building these networks.Second, the F.C.C. must make reasonably priced high-speed access available to everyone. In the 20th century, we made a commitment to provide universal telephone service to every American and to subsidize that utility service for our poor and rural neighbors. High-speed Internet access is now undisputedly the dominant communications technology of our era. We need to make sure that subsidies are available for competitive companies willing to extend world-class service to more Americans.The F.C.C.’s Connect America Fund, which is supposed to promote such expansion, is mostly funneled back through existing communications companies. This isn’t the way to encourage new wired network providers to enter local markets. Nor will voluntary programs run by local monopoly cable distributors like Comcast meet our country’s needs.Finally, the F.C.C. must foster more competition by changing the rules that keep the status quo in place. There is a raft of regulations and processes at the F.C.C. that incumbents wield to maintain their market power, including rules about access to programming and to telephone poles that favor existing providers. The agency has ample administrative power to fix these details and to gather the information it needs to develop and enforce effective policies.We have allowed our affection for consolidation and profit-taking to shape our country’s ability to compete on the global stage. Although today’s communications networks should make it possible for anyone to create value, communications companies that control access in America have the ability to crush competition and innovation.With a truly pro-competition agenda at the F.C.C., we could discover great reservoirs of increased productivity and new forms of making a living. Contrary to what giant companies like Comcast and Verizon would have us believe, communications regulation does not stymie entrepreneurial behavior. It unleashes human ingenuity."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/business/economy/imf-forecast-global-economic-growth-modest-at-best.html,"WASHINGTON — The International Monetary Fund said on Wednesday that it continued to expect a modest upturn in global growth in 2013, with fewer risks of major policy mistakes and lower levels of financial stress.The fund cautioned, however, that growth was not expected to snap back to precrisis levels in the coming years. Over all, the fund expects global growth of 3.5 percent in 2013 and 4.1 percent in 2014, up from 3.2 percent in 2012. In the years just before the global downturn, annual economic growth was 4.5 to 5.5 percent.“If crisis risks do not materialize and financial conditions continue to improve, global growth could be stronger than projected,” the Washington-based fund said in its economic report. “However, downside risks remain significant, including renewed setbacks in the euro area and risks of excessive near-term fiscal consolidation in the United States. Policy action must urgently address these risks.”The fund issued a routine update to the projections it makes in its twice-yearly World Economic Outlook report. This time, it whittled down many of the forecasts for 2013 that it had made in October, knocking 0.1 percentage point from its United States growth forecast, 0.3 percentage point from the euro area and 0.4 percentage point from the newly industrialized Asian economies, like Singapore and South Korea.Still, the International Monetary Fund noted that financial stresses and the risk of a major policy shock in Europe and the United States had decreased. “Optimism is in the air,” said Olivier Blanchard, the fund’s chief economist, at a news conference. “Some cautious optimism may indeed be justified,” he added. “We may have avoided the cliffs, but we still face high mountains.”The fund said it downgraded its estimate of European growth from October despite “progress in national adjustment and a strengthened European Union-wide policy response to the euro area crisis.” It said that there might be “delays” as lower sovereign bond yields and reduced financial stress eventually translated into improved private sector borrowing conditions. It added that uncertainty about the ultimate resolution of the long-simmering European debt crisis remained high.Mr. Blanchard said that policy challenges “clearly” remained highest in certain European countries struggling with large debt burdens and slow-growing economies. He said business competitiveness and exports had improved recently, but high interest rates, pressure for budget cuts and uncertainty continued to depress growth.Slow growth in advanced economies, including the United States, Germany and Japan, will continue to weigh on growth in emerging economies, the fund said.Mr. Blanchard noted that financial markets had become considerably more sanguine over the last year. The European Central Bank started a major new bond-buying program and the United States avoided the worst of the so-called fiscal cliff package of tax increases and budget cuts. He said that could be a sign that the financial markets were experiencing some kind of “bubble” but also said that investors could be “seeing things which are truly good.” Ultimately, with less financial stress, the real economy should pick up, thus explaining the market optimism, he said.In terms of policy advice, Mr. Blanchard said that his “main message” would be that “financial market optimism should not lead to policy complacency.”For Washington, the “priority is to avoid excessive fiscal consolidation in the short term, promptly raise the debt ceiling and agree on a credible medium-term consolidation plan,” the fund’s economists said. Christine Lagarde, the fund’s managing director, and other officials have repeatedly warned politicians in Washington not to embark on too stringent an austerity program, for the good of the world economy as well as the United States.At the news conference, Thomas Helbling of the fund’s research division said that the United States faced a “long-term” fiscal problem, with much of the policy challenge resting in bringing down health care spending over time. He said that the challenge seemed “doable.”This month, the fund’s sister institution, the World Bank, released a rosier economic analysis. It foresees global growth of just 2.4 percent in 2013. But it said that emerging economies could worry less about downside risks from advanced economies and start focusing on domestic economic issues, like labor market or regulatory reforms."

Joseph Jimenez will remain as chief executive.Novartis said that its profit rose in the fourth quarter but that sales were flat because of price cuts and competition from cheaper drugs. Net income was $2.08 billion, compared with $1.21 billion in the period a year earlier, when it took a $900 million charge from ending its clinical study into wider uses of the hypertension drug Tekturna.The results were slightly above most analysts’ expectations.Mr. Jimenez said Novartis had a strong range of new products coming from research and development — including an infant vaccine for meningitis — and predicted net sales to grow after 2013.Fourth-quarter sales were almost flat at $14.83 billion, compared with $14.78 billion in the period a year earlier, and sales in 2013 are expected to suffer from the expiration of patents on the hypertension drug Diovan.Novartis said Gilenya, its once-a-day pill against multiple sclerosis, attained what it called “blockbuster status,” with full-year sales of $1.2 billion in 2012.Novartis expects the Food and Drug Administration to carry out an inspection in the coming months at its plant in Lincoln, Neb., which was shut down at the end of 2011 after officials found numerous problems with quality control. Mr. Jimenez told reporters in a conference call that in the meantime, the company was relying on third-party manufacturers to ensure the continued supply of products like Excedrin across the United States.Separately, Abbott Laboratories said on Wednesday that its profit fell 35 percent in the fourth quarter on costs from the spinoff of its drug business into the new company AbbVie.Abbott completed the split on Jan. 1, leaving it with a business model built around generic drugs, medical implants and nutritional formula. AbbVie will market the company’s branded prescription drugs, including the popular anti-inflammatory drug Humira.In Abbott’s last quarter as a combined unit, the company earned $1.05 billion, or 66 cents a share, compared with $1.62 billion, or $1.02 a share, in the period a year earlier.Earnings were weighed down by a number of one-time charges, including $265 million in separation costs. Excluding that and other charges, Abbott would have earned $1.51 a share. Revenue increased 4 percent, to $10.84 billion.Analysts polled by FactSet expected, on average, earnings per share of 70 cents a share on revenue of $10.61 billion.Finally, Amgen, the maker of the anemia treatments Aranesp and Epogen, posted a 16 percent drop in fourth-quarter profit as higher costs for production, marketing, research and other items offset higher sales for many of its biologic medicines. The results fell short of Wall Street expectations.Net income was $788 million, or $1.01 a share, compared with $934 million, or $1.08 a share, in the period a year earlier.Excluding one-time items, net income would have been $1.40 a share, 4 cents less than analysts expected, on average, according to FactSet.Revenue rose 11 percent, to $4.42 billion.Sales were led by the immune disorder treatment Enbrel, up 23 percent, to $1.16 billion, and Neulasta and Neupogen for fighting infection in cancer patients. They had a combined $1.31 billion in sales, down 1 percent.Sales of Aranesp and Epogen fell 9 percent and 1 percent, to a combined $968 million.Several newer drugs, like Prolia, Xgeva and Sensipar, had double-digit jumps in revenue."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/business/signs-of-a-housing-recovery-point-to-a-stronger-economy.html,"A funny thing is happening to the United States housing market. It is getting better at an accelerating rate.And therein could lie hope for a surprisingly strong economy this year.It has been a long time, as the economy worked off the excesses of the boom and cleared out the inventory of homes that should never have been built or were “sold” to people who could not hope to afford the payments. But now the inventory of houses for sale — both new and used — is as low as it has been in decades. Home prices are rising in most markets. Sales have picked up, though they are still low by historical standards.“We had 48 months of depression in the housing industry,” said Karl E. Case, an emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College and the co-developer of the Standard & Poor’s/Case-Shiller house price index. “Housing has brought us out of every recession in the past, and it was not available.”But now, he said in an interview, “there is no question that we have turned what seemed to be a headwind into a tail wind.”If that is correct, the benefits for the economy will be significant. They will not be just in the direct impact of spending on residential construction — although that is now growing at a faster rate than at any time since 1994 — or on such things as carpet and furniture. They will also show up in state and local government spending, until now one of the largest negatives during the slow recovery. Local government revenue is closely tied to property values through property taxes, and the collapse in home values led to layoffs of teachers and policemen, not to mention others, around the country.Then there is the wealth effect.Before the collapse, the very existence of a wealth effect tied to housing was debated among some economists. In 2001, Professor Case and two colleagues, John M. Quigley of the University of California, Berkeley, and Robert J. Shiller of Yale, analyzed data from 1982 to 1999 and concluded that rising home prices increased consumer spending, but falling prices did not reduce spending significantly.The last four years showed that last part was wrong. This week an updated version of the research, carrying it through last summer, was released by the National Bureau of Economic Research. “The extended data now show that declines in house prices stimulate large and significant decreases in household spending,” they reported. (Professor Quigley died before the paper was finished, but he is still credited as a co-author.)They concluded that the decrease in spending caused by a house price decline was greater than the increase in spending produced by an increase in house prices, but that might not turn out to be the case if we have a prolonged gain in prices. There may be a significant amount of pent-up demand for housing — not from people without it but from people who would like to move and would have done so already had the economy been better. Some of those people, perhaps chained to their old homes because the homes are not worth as much as is owed on the mortgages, might view breaking even on the old house as a sign that it is time to sell.The National Association of Realtors, which reports each month on sales of existing, or used, homes, tries to calculate how many sales are distressed and how much that distress lowers the prices received. Lately, the proportion of distressed sales has been declining slowly and so has the discount. In December, 12 percent of sales were said to be of foreclosed homes, and an equal number were short sales, in which the home is sold for less than the amount owed on the mortgage.There is reason to hope that those figures will continue to decline. Moody’s reports that the “shadow inventory” of homes with foreclosures pending and homes already owned by banks but not on the market is declining. It voices hope that banks “are finally putting behind them the operational and regulatory issues that plagued them in the past and are taking the steps necessary to address their backlogged foreclosure inventory.”At some point, the declining proportion of distress sales could well mean that house price indexes will begin to rise faster than the underlying market might really justify, as those sales stop holding down the averages.If that came as the economy began to strengthen enough that the Federal Reserve decided to let interest rates start to creep up, could that create a rush to buy among those who fear rising prices and mortgage interest rates?Perhaps, but nothing like during the old days. People do know now that prices can fall, demographics will limit the number of new families that need housing, and banks are far less willing to make loans than they were. (That is true even though nearly all mortgages are sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Banks fear they will have to repurchase any bad loans they sell, and seem to be erring on the side of caution.)But we don’t need a return to boom times for a substantial economic impact. Professor Case points out that during the nearly 50 years from January 1959 through September 2008, there was exactly one month — January 1991 — when the seasonally adjusted annual rate of housing starts, including both apartments and single-family homes, fell below 800,000.Beginning in October 2008, there were 47 consecutive months below 800,000. That string ended in September and last month the rate climbed to 954,000. Professor Case thinks it might get to 1.5 million. During the boom, it rose above 2.2 million.Last year there was a total of 780,000 starts. That was the highest in four years, but it was still lower than would have seemed possible a few years ago. Imagine if that total rises this year to 1.28 million, an increase of 500,000, and that each house involves an investment by the builder of $250,000. That would add an additional $125 billion to the economy compared to 2012.Over the most recently reported four quarters — through September, just as housing starts rose above the 800,000 rate — real spending on residential construction rose 13.6 percent. Not since 1994 had that sector risen so rapidly.Jobs are a lagging indicator — a fact that means home-building employment may be about to rise at a good clip. Notwithstanding the recovery in housing starts, there were fewer residential construction workers, on a seasonally adjusted basis, at the end of last year than there were when total employment bottomed in 2010. But home improvement contractors have started to hire at a good clip as homeowners decide to fix up what they cannot or will not sell.None of this is meant to suggest that the housing market is in good shape. But it is improving.During the years running up to the collapse of the housing bubble, Professor Case was among those warning that prices had risen to unsupportable highs. But now he has a different view.When I called him this week, he apologized for having to end the interview because of a prior appointment. “I’m going to look at a property that I may buy as an investment,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/technology/nokia-shows-a-profit-but-shares-drop.html,"BERLIN — The Finnish phone maker Nokia on Thursday reported its first quarterly profit in the almost two years since entering its smartphone alliance with Microsoft, but the company’s shares fell as doubts persisted about the company’s ability to accomplish a turnaround.The company, based in Espoo, Finland, said it had a profit of €202 million, or $269 million, in the three months through December, after a loss of €1.1 billion a year earlier. Sales fell 20 percent, to €8 billion from €10 billion, as it phased out an older line of smartphones that used the Symbian operating system.The company’s shares fell 5.5 percent in trading in Helsinki, closing at €3.30,  as Nokia announced that it would not pay a dividend for 2012, which would save the company about €750 million. It was the first time Nokia had not paid a dividend in recent memory, according to the company.Mats Nystrom, an analyst at SEB Enskilda Bank in Stockholm, said that Nokia had raised investor hopes  this month when it said it would report a quarterly profit, but that the company had not met those expectations with results that showed less-than-expected growth in the average selling price of the Lumia smartphone line and falling cellphone prices.“I still think it is far from a certainty that this turnaround will be a success,” Mr. Nystrom said.During a conference call with journalists, the Nokia chief executive, Stephen Elop, challenged that notion, saying the company had successfully eliminated investor concerns about its future. Nokia’s net cash on hand at the end of December, bolstered by the decision to forgo a dividend payment, rose to €4.4 billion from €3.6 billion in September.“For investors, it was a solid quarter in which we removed concerns about our cash situation,” said Mr. Elop, a former senior executive at Microsoft. Over the past year, he has closed factories across Europe and eliminated 16,500 workers from Nokia’s phone business.The quarterly net profit was the first since Nokia announced its alliance with Microsoft in February 2011, which set off a turbulent transition that led to about €5 billion in combined losses, the laying off of a third of the company’s work force and a steep decline in its market share in smartphones, the industry’s defining segment.While sales of Nokia’s new Lumia line, which uses the Microsoft Windows Phone operating system, are accelerating, to 4.4 million units in the fourth quarter from 2.9 million in the third, the company remains a distant challenger to the industry leaders, Apple and Google, whose Android operating system is now running nearly two-thirds of all new smartphones sold around the world.Apple sold more than 10 times the number of iPhones during the fourth quarter, 47.8 million, and sales of Android smartphones, according to International Data Corp., reached 136 million in the third quarter. But as the largest maker of smartphones running Microsoft’s new Windows Phone 8, Nokia can build on its gains.“This is really the time now for Nokia to put up results,” said Francisco Jeronimo, an analyst for International Data Corp. in London. “They are almost exclusively out there with Windows 8, and Microsoft is strongly promoting the operating system. There can be no more excuses now.”In North America, Nokia increased its sales of cellphones by 40 percent in the fourth quarter to 700,000 units, up from 500,000 in the third quarter. Mr. Jeronimo said those results were weak considering the sizable marketing investment in the United States and Canada by Nokia and Microsoft on Windows 8.Nokia’s share price has fallen by more than half during its software alliance with Microsoft. The shares have risen about 12 percent this year.In the fourth quarter, Nokia’s profit was fueled by continued cost-cutting and the introduction of the Lumia 820 and 920 smartphones running Windows Phone 8.The new handsets helped Nokia raise the average selling price of Lumia phones in the quarter to €186, up 33 percent from €140 in the quarter a year earlier. But the average price of Nokia’s basic cellphones, which still make up almost two-thirds of its total phone sales, fell 3 percent, to €31 from €32."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/technology/microsoft-reports-drop-in-profits.html,"SEATTLE — Microsoft’s biggest product in decades, Windows 8, helped lift sales of the company’s flagship operating system business, but not enough to rejuvenate overall growth.Microsoft, based in Redmond, Wash., said on Thursday that its profit declined 4 percent in the holiday quarter as its entertainment and office divisions posted double-digit declines in revenue.While Microsoft has a sprawling portfolio of technology products, like the Xbox game console and programming tools, Windows 8 was its star offering over the holidays, the product’s first quarter on the market.Windows 8 features one of the most radical redesigns of the operating system, with a tile-based interface intended to take better advantage of computers with touch screens, including tablets. Apple’s iPad has been nipping into sales of low-end laptop computers for some time, a trend Microsoft and its partners in the PC business desperately want to stop.There have been mounting signs in recent weeks that sales of new computers running Windows 8 have been sluggish. This month, IDC reported that worldwide PC shipments declined 6.4 percent in the fourth quarter, as Windows 8 failed to reverse a slide in PC sales that continued throughout most of 2012.Microsoft’s sales of Windows, which powers the vast majority of personal computers, appeared to be healthier than those numbers would indicate. It said its revenue from its Windows business, which accounts for more than a quarter of total company revenue, rose 24 percent to $5.88 billion for the fiscal second quarter ended Dec. 31.Those figures, however, included revenue from Windows sales before the product was officially available last November. Microsoft was required to defer that revenue because of accounting rules. Without it, Windows sales would have grown only 11 percent.While sales of Windows tend to closely track the performance of the PC market, Microsoft also sells Windows 8 upgrades to people who already have PCs. For the first time last quarter, the company’s Windows business also included sales of Microsoft’s own tablet computer, Surface, which it was not offering in the same period a year earlier.In an interview, Peter Klein, the chief financial officer of Microsoft, said that in some cases, sales of Windows 8 were hurt by the limited availability of computers with touch screens that more fully exploit the capabilities of the software: “We need to do more of those.”“I think we’ve learned a lot,” Mr. Klein said. “Business PCs are growing faster than consumer, emerging markets are growing faster than developed.”He declined to say how many Surface tablets Microsoft had sold, but he suggested the number was small because of the limited retail distribution of Surface, which was only available in Microsoft’s own stores until recently.The company said its net income for the quarter was $6.38 billion, or 76 cents a share, compared to $6.62 billion, or 78 cents a share, in the same period a year earlier.Revenue rose 3 percent to $21.46 billion from $20.89 billion a year ago.Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters, on average, had expected Microsoft to report earnings of 75 cents a share and revenue of $21.53 billion. The company’s shares were down 0.4 percent in after-hours trading.Microsoft’s results showed far more vitality in areas in which the company caters to big business customers, rather than consumers — a market that has eluded Microsoft many times over the years. Its best performing business was its server and tools division, which had a 9 percent increase in sales in the quarter.While its Office suite of applications showed weakness overall, as some customers delayed purchases ahead of the release of a new version of the product, business revenue from that division was up 2 percent and consumer revenue declined 2 percent, excluding deferred revenue.Other consumer-oriented divisions struggled, including entertainment and devices, the group dominated by the Xbox game console, which had an 11 percent decline in sales.Microsoft and its partners sold four times as many Windows Phones during the holiday quarter as they did a year earlier, Mr. Klein said. That is good news for Microsoft’s struggling mobile phone initiative, though the company still has a negligible share of the market.Revenue from Microsoft’s online services, which Bing is a part of, grew 11 percent, but the division continues to hemorrhage money.“It shows that Microsoft is evolving really into an enterprise software company,” said Bill Whyman, an analyst at ISI Group."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/business/city-officials-push-pension-funds-to-divest-from-gun-makers.html,"Fresh from persuading a $5 billion pension fund in Chicago to divest from companies that make firearms, the city’s mayor, Rahm Emanuel, on Thursday urged the chief executives of two major banks to stop financing companies “that profit from gun violence.”Mr. Emanuel sent letters to TD Bank, which provides a $60 million credit line to Smith & Wesson, and to Bank of America, which provides a $25 million line to Sturm, Ruger & Company, asking the C.E.O.’s to push the companies to “find common ground with the vast majority of Americans who support a military weapons and ammunition ban.”Mr. Emanuel’s effort to enlist banks in the gun control movement is just one example of a new willingness by a public official, galvanized by last month’s carnage in Newtown, Conn., to wield the power of the purse.New York State’s big public pension fund and California’s fund for teachers have already frozen or divested their gun holdings, and California’s fund for other public workers, known as Calpers, is expected to take up the issue in February.New York City’s public advocate has put pressure on banks and investment firms by ranking their gun holdings by size and calling the companies with the 12 biggest stakes the Dirty Dozen.“Elected leaders understand that this is a tool of government with huge ramifications,” said the public advocate, Bill de Blasio, who is a trustee of the city’s $45 billion pension fund. “What happened in Newtown sort of crystallized this.”In Philadelphia, Mayor Michael A. Nutter has prepared a wide-ranging set of principles that companies must adopt in order to receive city pension money. They apply not only to gun manufacturers but also to companies, like Wal-Mart and Sears, that sell firearms.Mr. Nutter calls them the Sandy Hook Principles, after the Newtown elementary school where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults with an assault-style weapon on Dec. 14. They are modeled on the steps the city took more than a decade ago to put pressure on companies doing business in South Africa under apartheid.Philadelphia’s pension trustees adopted the principles on Thursday. They have 90 days to notify any companies that are in violation, and if the companies fail to comply, the trustees will sell their stock.Mr. Nutter, who is also the president of the United States Conference of Mayors, said he hoped the approach would spread to other cities.How successful Mr. Emanuel, himself a one-time investment banker, will be with bank executives is still uncertain. He cannot make them sever business relationships.He told the Bank of America chief, Brian T. Moynihan, and the TD Bank chief, Bharat B. Masrani, that the trustees of Chicago’s main pension fund had just voted to unload more than $1 million worth of gun stocks, and said it was time for the bankers to get on board. “We can no longer wait,” he wrote.A spokesman for Bank of America declined to comment on Mr. Emanuel’s letter. A spokeswoman for TD Bank said she had not yet seen the letter and could not comment on it.Mr. de Blasio said he had already seen results from the Dirty Dozen list, his ranking of the New York-based financial services companies with the biggest holdings of firearms manufacturers. After he unveiled the list, he said, he received a phone call from Laurence D. Fink, chief executive of BlackRock, which Mr. de Blasio ranked second, with gun holdings of about $346 million.“Obviously, he was concerned about how the public saw the firm,” said Mr. de Blasio, who is running to succeed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg. He said Mr. Fink told him that BlackRock would start offering funds with no exposure to firearms.BlackRock does not actively pick weapons manufacturers as an investment strategy, said a spokesman, Brian Beades. Rather, it offers index funds and buys the stakes as it duplicates the makeup of stock indexes. Mr. Beades said that BlackRock was reaching out to institutional clients to offer index funds with the gun assets stripped out. Some were interested, he said, but others were not.The biggest gun investor on Mr. De Blasio’s list, with at least $706 million in gun holdings, was Cerberus Capital Management, a private equity firm that created the Freedom Group conglomerate out of a number of smaller makers of guns, ammunition and shooting accessories. The Freedom Group makes the Bushmaster semiautomatic rifle used in the Newtown massacre. Cerberus said last month that it would sell the group.The renewed activism by city officials is reminiscent of the 1990s, when America’s big public pension funds proudly threw their weight around in corporate boardrooms. Trustees said then that they considered it a part of their fiduciary duty to push for corporate reforms, and companies like Disney, General Motors and the New York Stock Exchange had to respond.The funds’ biggest successes were in campaigns to put financial pressure on tobacco companies and those with ties to South Africa. In the last decade, however, pension trustees were battered by huge investment losses and pay-to-play scandals, and turned their focus inward.On Tuesday, the board of New York City’s pension fund considered a resolution from Mr. de Blasio to divest from all weapons makers. Instead, the trustees voted in favor of another resolution, introduced by the Bronx borough president, Rubén Díaz Jr., to divest only from makers of assault weapons and high-capacity ammunition magazines.Many public pension trustees remain unconvinced that divesting from gun makers is consistent with their duty to protect the financial interests of retirees. Union officials in particular often say their job is to get maximum benefits for their members.“People understandably fear that there are constraints or limits to their fiduciary responsibility,” said Amer Ahmad, the Chicago comptroller, who pushed that city’s main pension board to divest on Wednesday. “But to the contrary, the mayor and I have made a long and, I feel, persuasive case that if we don’t act, we are actually failing in our fiduciary duty.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/opinion/new-yorks-low-buzz-budget.html,"Gov. Andrew Cuomo of New York presented an extra-lean state budget this week, his third conservative spending plan since taking office in 2011. The total outlays for fiscal year 2013-14, including federal funds to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy, will be almost $143 billion. The budget contains some real bonuses, including a plan to raise the minimum wage and a proposal for a workable database for gun ownership. But it could also raise the debt load, especially in struggling upstate areas.The budget, which must be approved by the Legislature before April 1, increases state spending by less than 2 percent statewide. That is admirable restraint, but the budget is not free of Albany’s traditional sleight-of-hand, like one-time cash infusions. For instance, the governor would dip into reserves for the state insurance fund, although he does say that the money will go mainly to capital projects, not daily expenses. And since the state is nearing a debt limit imposed in 2000, the governor wants to free the State University of New York to issue more of its own debt in the future.One of the more questionable aspects of the budget is a provision labeled the “Stable Rate Pension Contribution Option.” Innocent as that sounds, the provision would give local communities the freedom to stretch out their pension obligations to the state by paying less now, and almost certainly more later on. The mayor of Syracuse, Stephanie Miner, describes this as “kicking the can down the road.”State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli would have to approve this idea, a decision he should consider carefully. Communities like Syracuse pay pension costs into the state’s $150 billion pension fund, and lower contributions from these communities could make the state plan more vulnerable.Besides, most of these cities need more help than this revision to the pension plan. Many are struggling with the 2 percent property tax cap Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature imposed in 2011, and there has been little relief from state mandates. Nor does this budget offer these communities anything new in the way of unrestricted state assistance.There are other questions for legislators to consider, but by Albany standards this is mostly a low-trauma budget that will need only a few fixes."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/business/starbucks-earnings-increased-13-in-latest-quarter.html,"Starbucks said on Thursday that its profit rose 13 percent in the latest quarter, in line with Wall Street’s expectations.The company’s results were helped by a 6 percent increase in global sales at cafes open at least a year.The performance reflects the turnaround Starbucks has made since its struggles during the recession. After bringing back its founder, Howard Schultz, as chief executive in 2008, the company embarked on a reorganization that included closing underperforming stores in the United States.Mr. Schultz has said that the company has the ability to keep growing even through a turbulent economy because most people see Starbucks as an “affordable luxury.”Starbucks said it earned $432.2 million, or 57 cents a share, in the quarter, up from $382.1 million, or 50 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue in the period ending Dec. 30, the first quarter of Starbucks’s fiscal year, rose 11 percent, to $3.8 billion. Analysts had expected a profit of 57 cents a share and revenue of $3.85 billion, according to FactSet.Shares rose 11 cents on Thursday, to $54.57 a share."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/us/politics/republican-governors-push-taxes-on-sales-not-income.html,"WASHINGTON — Republican governors are moving aggressively to cut personal and corporate income taxes, including proposals that would increase reliance on state sales taxes, setting up ambitious experiments in tax reform that could shape what is possible on a national level.Even as Washington continues to discuss, if not act, on ideas for making the federal tax system simpler and more efficient, governors, some with an eye on the next presidential race, are taking advantage of the improving economy and a gradual rebound in revenues to act.In Louisiana, Gov. Bobby Jindal is pushing to repeal the state’s personal and corporate income taxes and make up the lost revenue through higher sales taxes. Gov. Dave Heineman of Nebraska is calling for much the same thing in his state. Gov. Sam Brownback of Kansas wants to keep in place what was supposed to be a temporary increase in the state sales tax to help pay for his plan to lower and eventually end his state’s income tax.Along the way these governors are taking small first steps into a debate over what kind of tax system most encourages growth in a 21st-century economy. In particular they are focusing attention on the idea, long championed by conservatives but accepted up to a point by economists of all stripes, that the economy would be better served by focusing taxation on consumption rather than on income.Taxing consumption has the potential to lift economic growth by encouraging more savings and investment. But the shift could also increase inequality by reducing taxes predominantly for the wealthy, who spend a smaller share of their income than middle- and lower-income people.“The question of whether we should tax income or whether we should tax spending is really a proxy for a different debate,” said Joseph Henchman, vice president for state projects at the Tax Foundation, a conservative-leaning research organization. “Everyone agrees we’ll get more growth with consumption taxes. It’s just that some people prioritize fairness.”Beyond citing economic growth, the governors and their supporters say their plans would help make their states more competitive in attracting employers and high-skilled workers, simplify their tax systems and curb pressure for more government spending.For Mr. Jindal and other Republican governors who are considering a presidential run in 2016, there are obvious political benefits to having a robust income tax-cutting record to present to conservative primary voters.But Democrats say the approach would lead to cutbacks in education, health care and other vital services while shifting relatively more of the tax burden to those who can least afford it.“These aren’t pro-growth policies — they’re shell games that reward the wealthiest Americans at the expense of everyone else,” said Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Democratic Governors Association.Nationwide, sales taxes account for about 46 percent of state revenues, and personal and corporate income taxes for about 42 percent, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. States with relatively low income tax rates like Louisiana, which raises about $3 billion a year from its personal and corporate income tax system, can more easily shift toward a sales tax-only system than states with much higher rates, like New York or California.Louisiana already has the nation’s third-highest sales tax, after Tennessee and Arizona. Combined state and local sales taxes average 8.84 percent, according to the Tax Foundation.It is not clear whether any of the proposals will make it into law; even in states with Republican-dominated legislatures, governors face difficulty as they pursue their proposals because changing the tax code almost invariably creates losers as well as winners. In Kansas, Mr. Brownback wants to pay for lower income tax rates in part by making permanent what had originally been a temporary sales tax increase, but also by eliminating deductions for property taxes and mortgage interest, setting off objections even in his own party.And just as President Obama has raised income tax rates on upper-income families, Democratic governors including Martin O’Malley of Maryland, Jerry Brown of California and Deval Patrick of Massachusetts have supported or put in place income tax increases on the wealthy.“I don’t believe greater reliance on the sales tax is likely to be a broad trend in the country, although we may see it in some places,” said Donald J. Boyd, a senior fellow at the Rockefeller Institute of Government. “In recent years voters and politicians have generally shown in a variety of ways that they have been more willing to support tax increases on higher-income taxpayers than on the broad populace.”The shift toward sales taxes in some states is incremental, and nowhere near the scale or complexity that would characterize adoption of a federal consumption tax.Still, the results could resonate in other states and in Washington. Nearly all other wealthy countries have some version of a national consumption tax.The debates going on in the states, said R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the business school at Columbia University and a former top adviser to President George W. Bush, “offer suggestions for federal tax reform, too.” He cited proposals for marrying a broad-based national consumption tax with a wage tax on high earners to address concerns about fairness.Mr. Jindal, whose status as a likely candidate for the White House in 2016 has drawn particular attention to his proposal, has signaled that he wants his plan to be revenue neutral, meaning that every dollar of revenue lost from eliminating the personal and corporate income tax would have to be made up elsewhere. The only viable source for making up most of the money is raising the state’s sales tax.He has not yet settled on any specifics for changing the sales tax, and his aides say he would include safeguards to assure that lower-income people were not made worse off.By focusing on sales tax revenue, Mr. Jindal has also opened up a fundamental issue in an Internet-heavy economy. Sales taxes were developed in an era when sales of physical goods dominated the economy, and they exempt many services, which now account for a majority of spending.Hair spray is taxed, but not haircuts. So if states — or one day the federal government — want to shift toward a truly broad-based consumption tax, they would have to expand the definition of what should be taxable.Officials in Louisiana have indicated that Mr. Jindal is at least open to looking at a broader sales tax that included some services.“If the sales tax is going to stay a viable source of revenues for state governments, you have to bring in services,” Mr. Henchman said. “It’s not just haircuts and tattoo parlors. It’s lawyers and accountants and real estate agents.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/opinion/northeast-faces-stark-choice-on-climate-pollution.html,"BOSTONEIGHT years ago, a bipartisan coalition of Northeast and mid-Atlantic governors joined forces to reduce pollution from electric power plants. They agreed to cap overall emissions of carbon dioxide, the major pollutant driving global warming, and require the more than 200 power plants in the region to buy permits to emit the greenhouse gas.The governors reasoned that plant operators would have an incentive to clean up their emissions if they had to pay for the carbon dioxide they discharged. Over the first three years of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, average annual emissions were indeed 23 percent less than in the previous three years, and auctions of allowances — or permits to pollute — raised $952 million, much of which has been invested in clean energy programs.But the future effectiveness of this market-based cap-and-trade system, the first but not the only one of its kind in the nation, is now in question. The nine states in the initiative are preparing to reset the emissions cap — or the total amount of carbon dioxide that power plants can emit — and some of the proposals would allow power plants to increase the amount of carbon dioxide they dump into the atmosphere.Cap-and-trade programs are designed to lower emissions gradually by reducing the cap and the allowances that are available. Polluters get flexibility in cutting emissions by being able to trade allowances among themselves. The idea is to achieve the reductions at the lowest cost through market forces rather than through direct regulation.But of the four cap-adjustment proposals under consideration, three would reset the cap above current emissions and allow pollution to rise through 2020. Only a fourth option would continue to drive down pollution by resetting the cap at 91 million tons, the current emissions level, and then reducing it by another 2.5 percent a year through 2020.Opponents of the initiative, known as R.G.G.I., argue that lower-cost natural gas has eliminated the need for the program by reducing the use of dirtier coal and oil. Growing investments in energy efficiency and renewable electricity have also helped to reduce emissions by cutting demand for electricity from power plants that burn fossil fuels.But those developments don’t argue against R.G.G.I., which determines what electricity generators may not do — namely, discharge unlimited quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. If market forces deliver emissions reductions cheaper and faster than anticipated, then states should lock in that progress with a binding cap to ensure that emissions don’t rise and that incentives for reducing pollution remain.The proposals that would allow emissions to increase reflect the success of opponents of efforts to slow climate change, who have fought against initiatives like R.G.G.I.Americans for Prosperity, an organization backed by the billionaire Koch brothers, has been at the forefront of this effort. The group sought unsuccessfully to repeal R.G.G.I. in Maine and New Hampshire, and A.F.P. members sued but failed to extricate New York from the initiative. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey did pull his state out of the initiative last year, arguing that low-cost natural gas made the program unnecessary.R.G.G.I.’s economic performance tells a different story. Auctions of allowances pay for energy efficiency programs that curb power plant emissions, bring down energy prices and save consumers money. These savings flow back into the economy, increasing growth and employment in the region. An independent report published in 2011 by the Analysis Group, a consulting firm, said that electric customers would save $1.1 billion on their bills over 10 years from energy efficiency measures paid for by the sale of allowances. These savings would generate an additional $1.6 billion in economic growth, as money that otherwise would be spent on electricity generated with imported fossil fuels is instead spent in the local economy.This initiative carries broad significance. President Obama’s reaffirmed commitment to address climate change will move forward in part through regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and R.G.G.I. could serve as a template for other states seeking to comply with new federal requirements.Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York recently committed to ensuring the program’s continuing effectiveness, and we encourage all of the participating states to make the program as strong as possible and put the public good over interests vested in the dangerous status quo of unchecked pollution."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/business/global/chinese-manufacturing-data-suggest-muted-recovery.html,"HONG KONG — A survey of manufacturing activity in China on Thursday provided more reassurance that the Chinese economy, buoyed by somewhat improved global trade and a string of government stimulus measures last year, has settled into a muted recovery.The reading of the purchasing managers’ index, published by the British bank HSBC, rose to 51.9 in January from 51.5 in December. It was the fifth consecutive improvement in the monthly index, and took the number to its highest level in two years.The early version of the HSBC index, which is based on about 90 percent of the survey results, provides one of the earliest insights into the world’s second-largest economy each month, and is thus closely watched by analysts and investors.“The upbeat manufacturing PMI reading heralds a good start to China’s economic growth into the New Year,” commented Qu Hongbin, chief China economist for HSBC, in a note accompanying the data release. While export growth was likely to remain tepid, he added, infrastructure construction was regaining momentum, and companies had started to step up hiring and manufacturing again.The reading underlined a picture that has been crystallizing since last year: That the years of double-digit growth are a thing of the past, and that China’s economy has, for now, settled into a more modest pace of expansion.Data released last week showed that the Chinese economy expanded just 7.8 percent last year — from 9.3 percent in 2011 and 10.4 percent in 2010.The last few months have shown an improvement as government-mandated measures aimed at propping up growth filtered through to the economy.But that recovery has been modest. The January HSBC index released Thursday, for example, was just 4.3 points higher than its last trough in August, Mr. Qu noted. By comparison, the rebound of 2009 saw the index jump more than 9 points in just five months. "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/nyregion/storm-damaged-homes-mean-lower-property-tax-revenues-in-new-york-region.html,"Localities across the New York region, already reeling from the cost of cleaning up from Hurricane Sandy, are confronting the prospect of an even bigger blow to their finances: a precipitous decline in property tax revenues.The storm damaged tens of billions of dollars’ worth of real estate, especially in coastal areas of Long Island and New Jersey. As a result, localities can no longer expect to reap the same taxes from properties that have lost much of their value — in some cases, permanently.Without new revenues, state and local officials and Wall Street analysts said, these areas may have to make deep cuts in spending on schools, police and fire departments and other services. They also may be hard-pressed to finance rebuilding.“Absolutely, this is going to be devastating for several years,” said Ester Bivona, former president of the New York State Receivers and Collectors Association, which represents local tax officials.The Division of Local Government Services in New Jersey estimated this month that more than a dozen municipalities in the state could lose at least 10 percent of their tax bases. About another 10 face a drop between 5 percent and 10 percent, state and local officials said.Among the worst hit is Toms River, one of New Jersey’s largest municipalities, with 90,000 people. It recently warned Wall Street that property tax receipts could drop 10 percent to 15 percent, according to its financial disclosure documents.Down the coast, the tiny borough of Tuckerton lost close to 20 percent of its property tax base. In Sea Bright, nearly half the homes are uninhabitable.The situation is similar on Long Island, according to interviews with officials there.The village of Freeport in Nassau County expects that many of its 15,000 homeowners will qualify for reductions in property tax bills, erasing at least 5 percent of property tax revenues and probably far more.Experts said the looming revenue crisis for localities in the region underscores how natural disasters can have a profound effect long after the debris is gone.If localities try to raise overall tax rates to make up for looming deficits, they may touch off a backlash from homeowners with undamaged properties.“My thing is to encourage property owners to not seek reassessments because you’re going to pay on one end or the other,” said Andrew Hardwick, Freeport’s mayor. “If too many people seek reassessment and are successful with it, that means, how do you pay the bills on the other end? You raise the taxes again? It doesn’t make sense.”Some localities, like Long Beach, on Long Island, had shaky finances before the storm and are now in deeper trouble, according to local budget records. But many others had been on solid financial ground.Two major bond-rating agencies, Moody’s Investors Service and Standard & Poor’s, have expressed concerns in recent weeks about the fiscal stability of numerous municipalities in the region.New York City and county governments in New York are far less reliant on property taxes than localities, so they are expected to have an easier time weathering a drop in the value of the tax base caused by storm damage. The city, for example, has its own income and business taxes.What’s more, the city and county governments in both states have a much broader property tax base than small localities.The $50.7 billion Hurricane Sandy relief bill approved this month by the House of Representatives provides up to $300 million in low-interest loans for localities facing shortfalls. The Senate has supported a similar provision in its own relief package.But some local officials said such financing was not nearly enough. States themselves have not yet sent aid, and senior state officials said they were not inclined to do so until federal money was exhausted.“It’s a pretty inescapable conclusion that there will be an impact on the tax base,” said Michael Drewniak, chief spokesman for Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey.“In many instances, we had homes completely wiped out or severely damaged to the point they were rendered uninhabitable,” Mr. Drewniak said. “That left behind rebuildable land but, in the meantime, no ‘improvements’ to tax. In other cases, people may find it cost prohibitive to rebuild at all, depending on their individual circumstances.”It could be a year or two before the aftereffects are fully understood, given that localities will have to assess damaged properties before lowering property taxes on them.That process, in fact, could be contentious. Some localities take as long as two years to incorporate revised assessments into taxpayers’ bills. In the meantime, homeowners may balk at paying the higher tax when their properties are seriously damaged or destroyed.But legally, they must pay every penny until the property has been reassessed.Corinne DiSomma, the tax receiver for Babylon, N.Y., was duty-bound last month to send out thousands of property tax bills — her annual “Christmas cards,” as friends tease. They were based on July 1 values, no matter that scores of homes, in addition to her own, were heavily damaged in the storm.Dan Tergesen’s home burned down in Babylon when the storm kept firefighters from reaching it in time. Local officials, he said, have since advised him that any reduction of his tax bill could be slow in coming, and “of course, they want me to rebuild my house as quickly as possible, so I am back on the tax rolls.”Localities are also facing the prospect that homeowners will demand that property taxes be cut because of perceived decreases in the value of land beneath their homes.Assessors rarely mark down land. But some homeowners may argue that their beachfront properties are worth less because buyers, newly sensitive to extreme weather, will avoid areas seen as vulnerable.“We feel our market value will go down significantly, not just on the house but also the land,” said Kathy Barisciano, the president of the Ortley Beach Voters and Taxpayers Association, in Toms River. Ms. Barisciano said she has been telling town officials that they must take into consideration the fact that buyers may avoid Ortley Beach because of uncertainty over whether its battered beaches will be replenished and fortified against future storms.Still, some officials said they were trying to find a silver lining.In the Village of Mastic Beach, a newly incorporated patch of Long Island with 7,500 pieces of property, damage was reported at 400 homes.“Definitely, it’s going to hurt the tax base of the village,” Mayor Bill Biondi said. “We’re a fairly new village, and in the two years, we’ve been hit with two hurricanes.”But Mr. Biondi said he was hopeful that property tax revenues would rise again once people rebuilt bigger, sturdier homes. He noted that 100 homes in the flood zone were going up on pilings.“We may get hit the first year,” he said, “and then I’m really hoping to bounce back bigger and better.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/arts/design/the-last-supper-by-julie-green-at-arts-center-in-oregon.html,"CORVALLIS, Ore. — One man wanted only ice water as his last meal before execution. Another asked that his mother be allowed into the prison kitchen to make the chicken dumplings he loved. Another told the guards he had never had a birthday cake, so they bought him one, along with his formal last-meal request, a pizza. Some asked for nothing, or nothing special — a regular prison dinner, food from the vending machines, a cigarette and a soda.In 1917 in Montana, a condemned man said in the hours before his death: “I have a bad taste in my mouth. I want an apple.”Julie Green has painted their stories — fittingly enough, on plates, in cobalt-blue paint fired to permanence — along with hundreds of other such chiaroscuro tales of food and death and choice, in a decade-long project she calls “The Last Supper.” This month, 500 of her plates, the largest show of her work ever mounted, went on display in the Arts Center, a former Episcopal church in this college town south of Portland, where Professor Green is an associate professor of art at Oregon State University.That the world knows what a condemned person was served — indeed, that such information is often part of the narrative of the execution itself, posted on Web sites and in news articles from the prison — is what initially caught Professor Green’s attention.“The meals were so personal, they humanized death row for me,” she said.But as she worked — spending six months of each year on the project, and making about 50 plates a year — she came to see the choice of last meal as a window into the soul in an hour of crisis, and also into the strange rituals society has attached to the ultimate punishment.“I’m a food person,” she said. “I grew up with great cooks and great food. Food has always been a celebratory thing for me. That’s part of why this whole thing is interesting to me, because of the contrast. It’s not a celebration.”The number of executions has declined in the United States in recent years, from a modern-era high of 98 in 1999 to 43 in 2012. Texas, which has put more people to death than any other state since capital punishment was restored in 1976 by the United States Supreme Court, stopped offering special last meals to the condemned in 2011. But the number of Professor Green’s plates keeps growing: She plans to continue painting as long as there is a death penalty.Some of the paintings are inspired by long-ago executions, described in news clippings — like the plates she did about two black boys, ages 15 and 16, sent to the electric chair in Mississippi in 1947 on murder charges. They were given fried chicken and watermelon, the records show. Whether they requested that meal is unknown, Professor Green said, but it was dutifully recorded, and so those images — so fraught with racial baggage — went onto plates.Other plates were painted fresh from the news, and some were completed on the day of the execution itself. Most show predictable, even mundane meals: a hamburger and fries, enchiladas, steak and baked potatoes. Others come from a place that clearly spoke only to the condemned: Four olives and a bottle of wild-berry-flavored water for one, a jar of dill pickles for another. One man asked for “God’s Word.” Another wanted “justice, equality, world peace.”The underlying and compelling theme of the work is choice. What do people who may have lived for years in prison with virtually no choices at all do with this last one they’re offered? Do they reach back for some comforting reminder of childhood? (Professor Green suspects as much in the cases of meals like macaroni and cheese or Spam.) Do they grasp for foods never tried, or luxuries remembered or imagined? (One condemned man ordered buffalo steak and sugar-free black walnut ice cream; another, fried sac-a-lait fish topped with crawfish étouffée.)Even choosing not to choose has meaning, with some inmates apparently seeing the last-meal question as something they simply can’t face — answering it would be acknowledging their fate.“No final meal request because he remained hopeful to the end that he would not be executed,” Virginia prison officials recorded about a man executed there in February 2009. The plate for that man has only text.Making a condemned person’s last meal into art is a tricky proposition, given the fierce debate about capital punishment, and Professor Green said she had sometimes been criticized for doing it. In presenting shows and lectures about the work around the country, she has been accused of trying to capitalize on the death penalty — although the project, she says, is strictly not for profit. That she makes no secret of her opposition to the continuing practice of execution probably adds its own fuel, she said.Some years back Professor Green exhibited about 100 plates at a food and arts center in Napa, Calif., that is now closed. “Folks standing in line for foie gras at one of the finest restaurants in the U.S. were confronted with final meals,” she said in an e-mail. Many responded positively, she added, “but others wrote that the exhibit was ruining their appetite.” One visitor called Professor Green a “stinky hippie” and told her to go back to Oregon. “I keep all the comment books,” she said.But where some critics might see an unduly sympathetic portrait of people convicted of heinous crimes, David Huff, the executive director of the Arts Center in Corvallis, said he saw humanity with all its flaws and foibles. “I don’t think it excuses actions,” he said. “They may have done really bad things.”“But regardless of what you think about it, you have to accept that these are people,” he added. “They were actual people with likes and dislikes — liking pizza and Coke, or shrimp.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/selection-of-the-boeing-787s-battery-maker-raises-questions.html,"As the search for the cause of smoldering batteries in Boeing’s grounded 787 Dreamliner continues, investigators and Congressional oversight committees may want to look into a related and potentially sensitive issue: how was the Japanese company GS Yuasa chosen to manufacture the innovative but now suspect lithium-ion batteries on the 787?No one has claimed that GS Yuasa was chosen for the 787 on anything but merit. But Boeing has long been dogged by suspicions that in return for its awarding major contracts to Japanese companies, which also receive subsidies from Japan’s government, the country’s airlines buy Boeing aircraft almost exclusively.Such arrangements are banned by the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, signed by the United States and Japan, which requires that aircraft purchases be made solely on the basis of “commercial and technological” factors and that procurement contracts should be entered into only on the basis of “competitive price, quality and delivery.” The agreement is intended to ensure that purchase decisions are based “strictly on technical and commercial factors,” according to the United States trade representative.“The world has made tremendous progress” at eliminating political influence from the sale of aircraft and components, Richard L. Aboulafia, an aerospace and aviation analyst for the Teal Group, a consulting firm in Washington, told me this week. “And then, there’s Japan. All the normal ways of doing things are upended.” Is there a quid pro quo? “Yes, absolutely. But no one will talk about it, and no one can prove it,” he said.A former Boeing executive confirmed this when we spoke this week. After asking not to be named because of the diplomatic fragility of the topic, he said: “Let me put it this way: we knew the Japanese market would be Boeing’s in return for our selecting these Japanese partners. It was a silent understanding, and there was nothing in writing.” He added that Boeing’s Japanese suppliers had received low-interest loans from the Japanese government repayable only out of future profits.Although the Japanese airlines and suppliers are independent companies, “in Japan there’s a unique relationship between the airlines, the suppliers and the government,” according to the former Boeing official. “It’s cultural. The officials all went to the same schools and have close personal relationships. The government supported the airlines and the industries and they developed together. The government has enormous influence. They all work together.”As a Boeing vice president and former Boeing Japan president, Nicole Piasecki, told the company magazine in 2008: “These aren’t just relationships with people in business. The Japanese government is a powerful and important part of all economic activity and industrial development. So part of relationship building is negotiating these two important spheres of influence in Japan and understanding it’s all tied together.”Mr. Aboulafia agreed that Japan was unique. “This is the way things used to be in the days before free trade,” he said. “Japan is the last unreconstructed believer in industrial policy writ large.”The Japanese External Trade Organization referred questions to the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, which had no immediate comment.In response to my questions, Boeing declined to address the specific choice of GS Yuasa for the 787 batteries, but said, “In general, internal and external suppliers of the 787 program were selected based on their ability to do the work with the high quality, affordability and reliability that customers expect from Boeing and that Boeing demands of its partners.” Boeing added that “GS Yuasa provides the batteries under subcontract to Thales,” the French company responsible for the 787’s electrical systems, but confirmed that Boeing approved the choice and that all subcontractors had to meet Boeing’s quality standards.Nonetheless, there’s circumstantial evidence to support suspicions that quality and price may not be the only factors affecting the choice of Boeing’s Japanese partners. Japan’s market for commercial aircraft is dominated by Boeing to a degree unrivaled by any other country. Over the last decade, Boeing supplied over 80 percent of the aircraft ordered by Japanese customers. The nation’s flagship airline, Japan Airlines, has never ordered a plane from Airbus, Boeing’s rival. The Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways flew the 787’s maiden commercial flight and has placed an initial order for 50 aircraft. Boeing said that over the last 50 years, Japanese carriers had ordered 900 Boeing aircraft, making Japan one of its top markets by dollar volume.Airbus has struggled to gain traction in the Japanese market. Evidently taking a page from the Boeing playbook, it said it invested an estimated $4.6 billion with Japanese suppliers for its jumbo A380. But $4.6 billion is a drop in the bucket compared with Boeing’s spending over the decades. Airbus has since booked four orders for the A380 from the low-cost Japanese carrier Skymark Airlines. Airbus has long accused the Japanese government of engaging in improper subsidies to Boeing; an Airbus executive called the 787 the most heavily subsidized civil aircraft in history.China hasn’t signed the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, and aviation analysts have been watching closely to see if it will follow Japan’s lead or embrace a free trade approach. Airbus has invested more heavily than Boeing in China, where Airbus built its first assembly line outside of Europe. But so far, its market share in the rapidly growing Chinese market has remained about the same as Boeing’s. China is also trying to develop its own domestic aircraft industry to compete with Boeing and Airbus.Boeing patronage has certainly brought benefits to Japan. Its three giant “heavy” industries — Mitsubishi, Kawasaki and Fuji — have been significant partners with Boeing since the development of the 767. According to Boeing, they supply major components of the 767 and 777 airframes and were closely involved in the 777’s design. The company said its Japanese partners designed and developed 35 percent of the 787 airframe structure, including the main wing box, which is the first time Boeing has ever entrusted such a critical design component to another company. Under their agreements with Boeing, they produce components almost exclusively for Boeing. Mitsubishi is now manufacturing its own regional jet thanks in part to what it learned from working with Boeing.Boeing said that more than 65 Japanese companies were suppliers for both commercial and military products. Boeing said it directly or indirectly employed 22,000 people in Japan, or 42 percent of the country’s aerospace work force. Boeing also has close ties to Japan’s Defense Ministry, and the company said the two had “a long history of working together to meet Japan’s defense needs.” Besides pursuing aviation and aerospace, Japan announced last July, as part of its “Rebirth of Japan” strategy, that battery technology would be one of its top areas for development and investment. GS Yuasa makes no secret of the fact that its money-losing lithium-ion battery operation has received subsidies from the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, most recently 318.7 billion yen (or about $3.5 billion) to begin mass production of lithium-ion batteries for hybrid electric vehicles. (Japan is hardly the only country subsidizing the battery industry. A123 Systems, a manufacturer of lithium-ion batteries based in Massachusetts, filed for bankruptcy last year despite a $249 million grant from the Energy Department.)Landing the 787 contract was a huge boost for GS Yuasa and for Japan’s efforts in aviation technology. Though not well known outside of Japan, the company describes itself as Japan’s leading manufacturer of batteries and said it had supplied lithium-ion batteries for over 50 satellites “without anomaly or failure.” Still, this was its first effort in commercial aviation. “I had never heard of Yuasa in the aviation context,” Mr. Aboulafia said. GS Yuasa has since been chosen to supply lithium-ion batteries for the International Space Station. Although Pratt & Whitney nominally chose the company, Boeing is the prime contractor on the space station.There were better-known and more experienced suppliers of lithium-ion batteries for aviation uses when GS Yuasa was chosen, including the Saft Group of France, Mr. Aboulafia said. Saft describes itself as “the premier battery supplier to the aviation industry,” and Airbus is using Saft lithium-ion batteries for its new A350 aircraft.GS Yuasa may well have been the best choice for the 787. Still, all of this raises the question of whether GS Yuasa was chosen to design and manufacture the 787 batteries solely on the criteria of “price, quality and delivery” called for by the World Trade Organization agreement, or whether other political and commercial interests played a role. The latter “sounds all too plausible to me,” Mr. Aboulafia said. “That doesn’t mean they’re incompetent. The Japanese respect engineering expertise. You can’t argue that the Japanese heavy industries shouldn’t have played a role in the design and development of the 787. So far, their work has been very good.”And any questions about GS Yuasa may be premature. Although the batteries are suspected in the fires that grounded the 787 fleet, no one yet knows for sure. Both Thales, the French company responsible for the broader electrical system, and Securaplane, an American subsidiary of the British engineering firm Meggitt that makes the battery chargers, are also being investigated.But whatever the outcome, experts said that with so many lives at stake, the design and manufacture of new aircraft should be based solely on legitimate issues of cost and quality, and the selection process for suppliers should be transparent and untainted by other commercial or political concerns.“The greatest enemy of good aircraft is people who interfere with the freedom to shop for the highest quality,” Mr. Aboulafia said."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/global/japan-tries-to-ease-fears-that-its-policies-will-lead-to-currency-wars.html,"TOKYO — Japan brushed aside criticism that aggressive easing by the central bank could set off competitive currency devaluations among other nations, saying Friday that the Bank of Japan is trying to end nearly 20 years of deflation — not manipulate the yen.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s calls for aggressive action by the central bank, which have prompted a slide in the yen, have also raised fears in Europe of a currency war if other central banks adopt similar policies.Japan may have to defend its actions at a two-day meeting of financial leaders from the Group of 20 industrial and emerging nations that begins Feb. 15.“Monetary easing is aimed at pulling Japan out of deflation quickly,” the Japanese finance minister, Taro Aso, said Friday. “It is not accurate at all to criticize” Japan for manipulating currencies, he added.The Bank of Japan, the central bank, agreed Tuesday to double its inflation target to 2 percent and said it would pump more money into the economy via a new, open-ended commitment to buying assets beginning in 2014 — measures known as quantitative easing and intended to lift the country out of its fourth recession since 2000.“The B.O.J. is pursuing powerful monetary easing without interruption,” the central bank’s governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, said Friday. “Japan may be facing an opportunity now to emerge from stagnation.”Still, Japan’s consumer price index fell 0.1 percent in December from the same month a year earlier, and even when excluding volatile food and energy prices, it dropped 0.2 percent, according to data released Friday.The yen skidded to a two-and-a-half-year low of 90.695 against the dollar Friday, which reinforced expectations for more monetary easing. The currency has slumped 11 percent against the dollar since early November as Mr. Abe stormed to an election victory in December with bold promises to end decades of intermittent growth.After the central bank’s overhaul of its policy in the past week, Mr. Shirakawa offered a note of caution, saying it was important that the bank remain flexible in guiding policy in the future.“Long-term interest rates will spike and erode the effect of monetary easing,” he said, “if people perceive the B.O.J. as having shifted to a policy of recklessly buying government bonds, focusing narrow-mindedly on achieving 2 percent inflation.”Minutes of the central bank’s December meeting, released Friday, provided a hint of the possible next policy step.They showed that a Bank of Japan board member had proposed cutting interest rates, already at rock bottom, on some market operations and scrapping the 0.1 percent interest paid on excess reserves held at the central bank. The idea was voted down, 8 to 1.Since the global financial crisis that started five years ago, central banks in the Britain and the United States have also engaged in aggressive quantitative easing programs, which can help support economic growth by lowering interest rates but also tend to weaken the currency.Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany waded into the currency debate Thursday, singling out Japan as a source of concern following the Bank of Japan’s moves.“I don’t want to say that I look towards Japan completely without concern at the moment,” she said at the World Economic Forum in Davos. “It is known that in Germany we are of the opinion that central banks are not there to clean up political bad decisions and a lack of competitiveness.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/car-sharing-services-grow-and-expand-options.html,"WASHINGTON — As more companies and even nonprofits enter the fast-growing business of car sharing, they are offering consumers new ways to customize their short-term rentals for convenience, reliability and cost.Take the expanding Car2go service from Daimler, the German luxury-car maker. It rents only two-seat Smart cars, charges customers by the minute instead of the hour, and allows for one-way rentals and free street parking.That appealed to Austin Fossey, who turned to Car2go when his pregnant wife, Brooke, went into labor at 2 a.m. on Thanksgiving morning. He pulled up the Car2go app on his cellphone and reserved a tiny Smart car parked near the couple’s home in Washington. Car2go was exactly what they needed — a one-way drive to the hospital, at 38 cents a minute, with free parking on city streets and no requirement to return the vehicle.“We wanted to just drop the car off and not have to worry about it,” Ms. Fossey, 31, said in a recent interview as she held her newborn son, Ethan.Car2go is one of about two dozen car-sharing services in the United States, and its one-way vehicle rentals are the latest wrinkle in the growing industry.Providers range from small, nonprofit organizations to big corporations like Hertz, a longtime leader in the car rental industry, and Daimler, which started Car2go five years ago in Germany and now operates 1,800 vehicles in six American cities.New players are also getting in, including Avis Budget Group, another stalwart in the traditional rental business, which earlier this month agreed to buy the vehicle-sharing company Zipcar for $491 million.They are all drawn by the rising popularity of car sharing. Last year, about 800,000 people belonged to car-sharing services in the United States, a 44 percent increase from 2011, according to Susan Shaheen, co-director of the Transportation Sustainability Research Center at the University of California, Berkeley.With most of the services, customers pay a small annual fee to join, then make reservations over the Web or with a smartphone app. They typically unlock the car by swiping a special laminated card across a sensor on the windshield, and rates are usually by the hour.Amid all the competition, the rental providers are trying to differentiate themselves.Zipcar, for example, has long tried to portray itself as part of a young, hip lifestyle, calling its members Zipsters and promoting itself through a Twitter hashtag, #thatswhereiroll. It promotes its vast number of rental locations, including many on university campuses, and its blend of ordinary and prestige cars, from Ford Escape S.U.V.’s to Mini Cooper convertibles.Enterprise CarShare, which last year absorbed a Zipcar competitor called Mint, builds on Enterprise’s strong tradition of catering to businesses while offering customers the chance to try out newer technologies like Nissan’s all-electric Leaf.And nonprofit groups are adding their own specialized services to the industry, like City CarShare in San Francisco, which in 2008 created the first wheelchair-accessible car-share vehicle. Called AccessMobile, the program offers minivans that accommodate two people using wheelchairs along with three other passengers and a driver. Ms. Shaheen said variety was a key part of the industry’s growth, like “going to the chocolate shop and having access to 15 types of different chocolate.”Car2go’s chief executive, Nicholas Cole, said Daimler used the latest technology to provide cars almost instantly to members. For a $35 registration fee, Car2go members can locate and reserve a blue-and-white Smart microcar within 15 minutes. Members pay only a per-minute fee for the rental, and can park free in legal parking spaces in Washington and other participating cities. Car2go also lets members leave the car nearly anywhere in the city it is rented in.By comparison, Zipcar members pay an hourly or daily rate that typically winds up being cheaper than Car2go’s rates, but they have to return the rented vehicle to the same parking lot where they picked it up. (BMW’s DriveNow service in San Francisco also allows one-way rentals.)“Our members are not required to tell us how long they’re going to drive or where they’re going, as long as they bring it back to the whole area,” Mr. Cole said.One of Car2go’s big selling points is free parking. In Washington, for example, Car2go paid $2,890 per vehicle to the District of Columbia for free use of metered spaces. In some cities, including Miami, the company also rents spaces in parking garages.New York is among the cities under consideration for expansion, said Katie Stafford, a Car2go spokeswoman. “In New York, parking is going to be different than in other cities,” she said. “But we would come to an agreement that would make sense for us and the city.”While some automakers have struck supply partnerships with car-sharing services, as Ford Motor Company did with Zipcar in 2011, it’s less clear why a car-sharing service makes financial sense for Daimler to operate directly.Daimler, the German maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars and Freightliner trucks, said Car2go emerged from a business innovation group within the company that was looking at the future of transportation within cities. The service, which Daimler says has reached the break-even point in three cities, was begun in Europe and now has about 275,000 members worldwide.“There’s a trend in general for people wanting to pay for what they use,” said Mr. Cole of Car2go. “It’s like the success in iTunes, where people choose to buy a few songs instead of the whole album.” The need for cheap, convenient mobility is fueling the growth of car sharing around the world, said Ms. Shaheen of the University of California, Berkeley. She said that recent statistics showed 1.7 million car-sharing members in 27 countries, not including so-called peer-to-peer services that allow drivers to rent vehicles directly from individual car owners.So far, big corporations and smaller organizations coexist comfortably because of the growing demand for car sharing in urban areas.The arrival of companies like Daimler and Avis in the market “isn’t putting anybody out of business,” said Wilson Wood, head of the CarSharing Association, which represents 19 smaller providers, like City CarShare.A menu of mobility options works for some consumers, like Michelle Fox, a 27-year-old executive of a technology company in Washington. Ms. Fox recently sold her Toyota S.U.V. because of the cost of car payments, insurance and parking.Instead, she uses a combination of Car2go, a bicycle-sharing network and the Uber call-a-limo service.Last month, Ms. Fox used a Car2go Smart car to attend a friend’s birthday party in the busy Adams Morgan entertainment district in Washington. Since Smart cars measure less than nine feet long, “you can just squeeze Car2go in,” she said. After parking in a tight space on the street, she noticed someone watching her. It turned out to be another Car2go member who was looking for an available vehicle. “This puppy is not going to be here when I get back,” Ms. Fox said with a laugh."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/aw-clausen-former-bank-of-america-chief-dies-at-89.html,"A. W. Clausen, who rose from a part-time position counting cash to become chief executive of Bank of America and to lead the World Bank in the 1980s, died on Tuesday in Burlingame, Calif. He was 89.The cause was complications of pneumonia, family members said.Mr. Clausen, who was known by his nickname, Tom, was chief executive of Bank of America from 1970 to 1981 and again from 1986 to 1990. He was president of the World Bank in the intervening years. When he returned to Bank of America for his second term, it was in far worse shape than when he had left.Huge loan losses, both domestically and in Latin America, were weighing heavily on the bank’s balance sheet, and it was suffering from low morale and antiquated technology.Historically, Bank of America had rarely reached out of its inner circle to find new talent, but Mr. Clausen recruited four vice chairmen from crosstown San Francisco rival Wells Fargo to help turn things around.“It had been the gold standard, but when he came back, it was a different bank,” said Richard M. Rosenberg, one of the four recruited Wells executives. Mr. Clausen fought off a takeover attempt by First Interstate Bancorp, cut jobs, sold businesses to raise cash and overhauled the organization.By the time he left, Bank of America had posted a $1 billion annual profit and was “within shouting distance of being an excellent bank,” Mr. Clausen said in an interview with The New York Times upon stepping down in May 1990.Mr. Rosenberg, who succeeded Mr. Clausen as chief executive, recalled him as a serious, sober manager. “He was not a gregarious individual; he was very intense,” Mr. Rosenberg said. “I don’t think he had any hobbies. He was truly focused on the bank and running it with integrity.”Mr. Clausen was chosen by President Jimmy Carter to lead the World Bank shortly before Mr. Carter was defeated by Ronald Reagan in 1980, but the new administration supported Mr. Clausen’s nomination.His tenure at the World Bank was clouded by a deep recession in the United States and criticism that the institution should have done more to ease debt problems in emerging economies.Alden Winship Clausen was born in Hamilton, Ill., on Feb. 17, 1923, and got the nickname Tom from a character he played in a school play. His father, Morton Clausen, owned and edited the local weekly newspaper, The Hamilton Press.The younger Mr. Clausen attended Carthage College in Illinois before serving as a flying meteorological officer in the Army Air Corps from 1943 to 1946.After receiving his law degree from the University of Minnesota in 1949, Mr. Clausen took a part-time job at Bank of America while studying for the California bar and courting Mary Margaret Crassweller, who had moved to Los Angeles from Minnesota.Soon after securing a spot in the bank’s $225-a-month job training program, he married Ms. Crassweller. She died in 2001. The next year, he wed Helen Higgins, who had been his secretary at Bank of America and the World Bank.In addition to his wife, Mr. Clausen is survived by two sons, Eric and Mark, and five grandchildren."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/your-money/what-the-small-player-can-expect-when-using-a-lobbyist.html,"IF there is one thing most small-business owners have in common, it is that they have far less ability than big corporations to affect what happens to them politically.Few small-business owners — the kind of people who accumulate wealth through a service or manufacturing business and are working at it every day — have the deep pockets of a major corporation. Consider what Amgen, the world’s largest biotechnology company, did to help win an exemption in the so-called fiscal cliff bill to extend its patent on a profitable dialysis drug for two more years at a great cost to Medicare. It sent its 74 lobbyists in Washington to meet with — and direct contributions to — a host of politicians who worked in its favor.But even if small businesses can’t buy the kind of influence that a huge company like Amgen can, that does not mean they cannot buy influence at all. Still, as in other aspects of life, you get what you pay for.Entrepreneurs would want to hire a lobbyist for a fairly straightforward reason: they have an issue they want addressed or changed and they have reached the point where they feel they need to act. What is more difficult is acting on that impulse effectively, knowing it could cost a lot of money.Lawrence E. Scherer, a founder of State and Broadway, a lobbying firm in New York, said a typical retainer for a small-business client would be around $5,000 a month, but the assignment could last for a year or more. Suri Kasirer, once an aide to former Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York and president of Kasirer Consulting, said her typical retainer was $10,000 to $20,000 a month, with a three-month minimum.“For small-business owners, the idea of having a lobbyist interact with a government is so novel and so out of their scope that $5,000 a month could seem daunting,” Mr. Scherer said. “But as government has more issues in front of it, it could be a cheap date.”People who have success lobbying state and local governments — since the federal government is beyond the budget of individuals — tend to fall into three categories: they want something changed, they want something new or they want access.Avik Kabessa, chief executive of Carmel Car and Limousine Service in New York City, said he became part of a group of livery car owners in 2008 that lobbied the state to establish a workers’ compensation fund for livery drivers and to repeal a sales tax on livery fares.He said it took a year and a half for the lobbying effort to work. The costs were split among members of the group, called the Livery Round Table. (Livery companies fall between higher-end black car and limousine services and city taxis.)“I wish we had the expertise, knowledge and contacts to have been able to do this ourselves,” he said. “But just as you would go to a doctor when you’re sick, you go to a lobbyist for your legislative affairs.”Ms. Kasirer is working on a similar case with a group of small-business owners who do not often work well together. She is representing seven expediters — companies that are paid by contractors and developers to get various building permits in New York City. She said new rules could end their business.“We were approached by a few of them, and we said, ‘Let’s get as many of them together as we could,’ ” she said. “They realized that ultimately they could be put out of business, or their business could be so severely handicapped that they would have to lay off people.”For small-business owners, forming an ad hoc group and putting aside any competitive business interest to get something greater for their industry is important. So, too, is having the patience and the willingness to accept something short of their goal and then go back for more.Domenic Rom, a senior vice president at Technicolor, a postproduction company for film and television, became part of a group of similar companies that wanted to lobby for a tax credit. While New York offered tax credits for shooting a film or television show in the state, it did not offer similar credits to the postproduction part of the industry, which includes editing, sound design and adding computer-generated effects.Mr. Rom said the 14 companies created the Post New York Alliance and each paid $5,000 in dues. They began lobbying in 2009, working with Mr. Scherer. By the next year, they received a 10 percent tax credit for postproduction work.He said it did little to increase the number of films and shows coming to New York, so the next year they went back to the Legislature. “We said thank you so much for the 10 percent,” Mr. Rom said. “We said it wasn’t really moving the needle. We said 30 percent would be better.”When that was approved, 19 new projects worth some $30 million came to New York to do postproduction work, he said.“People have to understand that the Legislature is an incrementalist institution,” Mr. Scherer said. “It takes time to move your initiative forward.”That patience is certainly needed for someone trying to sell a product or service to a government agency. “There’s a huge market opportunity for lobbyists in New Jersey to work with clients who have a product or service that they want to sell, whether it’s solar, information technology, engineering services,” Dale J. Florio, managing partner at Princeton Public Affairs Group in Trenton, said. “You name it, counties are buying it.”Small-business owners become stymied, he said, by not knowing where to turn or how to distinguish themselves from other businesses doing similar work.Betty Crea Davidson is in this position now. She is trying to raise awareness of a software program she developed based on a difficult and costly technique to treat autism that she used with her son. She has turned to a lobbying firm to get her company, Apex Spectrum Guide, in front of state departments of education.“We don’t know what door to knock on,” she said. But the lobbying fees, she said, were a cost of doing business and an investment in her company.While a small-business owner is going to have the best chance of success on the local and state level, some will naturally fail and be out a lot of money.Lobbyists said business owners had to be prepared to ask themselves what they were trying to accomplish and then be ready to put in a lot of effort.“You want more than a meeting,” Ms. Kasirer said. “You want the correction. You want the contract. You need the next step.”She said business owners needed to ask themselves a series of tough questions: What are legislators going to be interested in? How are you going to make the case that this makes sense? How does government benefit? Who loses? Are more people going to be paying taxes if this gets done?Then comes the effort the business owner has to put in. “A lot of times, a small business thinks they have you on retainer and they don’t have to do any more,” Mr. Florio said. “They have to be an equal marketing partner. They have to do more to make it a success.”And lest anyone forget, lobbying is a business, with its share of false prophets. “The less scrupulous could give you a lot of hope and not much else,” Mr. Florio said. “It’s clearly buyer beware when you look into the market for retaining a lobbying firm. It helps to understand local politics.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/your-money/what-happens-when-you-dispute-a-credit-card-charge.html,"If you have ever disputed a charge with your debit or credit card company, you know what a potent weapon this type of complaint can be.The card issuer generally takes your word against the merchant or service provider at the outset, restores the money to your bank account temporarily or issues a credit and then goes about its investigation. It essentially demands that the merchant or service provider who supposedly did you wrong prove that it did no wrong at all.But if you have never wielded this power tool of consumerism, there are a few things you should know first. The cat and mouse game that goes on behind the scenes can be tilted much more — or much less — in your favor, depending on which charges you dispute and how you go about disputing them.Chances are you will need to use the dispute process sooner or later. We live in a world where you often cannot use cash to buy cocktails on an airplane and any individual can attach a card reader to a smartphone and accept card payments from anyone else. Mistakes will inevitably be made.Meanwhile, all sorts of online businesses depend on recurring subscription revenue. Mistakes will inevitably be made again. Oops, we somehow forgot to honor your request to cancel your subscription. Oops, we forgot again. Oh, but now it will take until the next billing cycle. Sorry!You have had the legal right to correct these mistakes ever since 1975, when the Fair Credit Billing Act went into effect. The law dictates that there be a process by which you can question unauthorized charges, billing errors and transactions involving goods or services you never received or merchants did not deliver in the way they were supposed to.This creates problems for merchants. Plenty of people pretend that they never received products that were supposed to arrive by mail and then dispute the charge, hoping their card company won’t be able to figure out that they are liars and thieves.Even legitimate beefs or misunderstandings create many problems. In the 12 months ending Sept. 30, 2012, Visa processed $2.07 trillion in transactions in the United States. While cardholders disputed just 0.037 percent of that amount, that adds up to $765.9 million in transactions under review. According to MasterCard, 0.05 percent of its transactions worldwide are subjects of dispute, so its card issuers will probably deal with over 15 million questionable charges this year. Several million of these disputes involve outright fraud, though none of the card networks would break out the exact percentages. Avivah Litan, an analyst at Gartner, estimates that 20 percent of disputes involve fraud.The rest require a lot of manual labor. Every time someone initiates a dispute, the bank that issued the card must look into it. Someone has to contact the merchant and wait for a reply that may include a receipt or other documentation.Merchants must carve out time to respond to each dispute. They also pay one-time fees for the privilege and may end up paying higher overall fees to accept cards if disputes are too frequent. Or they just get cut off from accepting cards altogether.The true cost per dispute to the banks of all of this back and forth ranges from $10 to $40, according to a 2010 estimate by the consultants at First Annapolis. Given that cost, according to Scott Reaser, a principal there, many banks will simply absorb the disputed charge on a consumer’s bill and never contact the merchant if it is below a certain threshold.That number will differ for every bank, though it probably averages around $25. Some large retailers, it turns out, have similar strategies, according to a 2009 Government Accountability Office report. So even if the bank contacts a merchant about the dispute, the merchant may allow the customer to win the dispute without bothering to investigate the complaint. The report did not say what the threshold was, and the G.A.O. is not permitted to identify the retailers it spoke to.It is tempting to conclude that you can get away with disputing any old thing under $25 and not have to worry about tangling with the merchant again. But given that frequent disputes can lead to higher costs down the road, some merchants vow to fight every one.Or they have consultants who make them fight as a condition of offering their assistance. That’s how Monica Eaton-Cardone, the co-founder of Chargebacks911.com, works with her merchant clients to help them keep their dispute rates down and get out (or stay out) of trouble with the companies that control their ability to accept cards.Why does she operate that way? The answer begins with her own painful experience in the direct response business, selling things to people who sometimes didn’t like what they received in the mail or didn’t realize they had signed up for a recurring service with regular bills.Faced with the threat of losing her ability to accept cards if the number of disputes didn’t decline, she realized there was a very basic problem with the process: she concluded that over 70 percent of the people disputing charges with their bank never called her, the merchant, to complain first.“When you go to a bank’s Web site and you see a button that says, ‘Dispute This Transaction,’ it doesn’t say that this is going to hurt the merchant and could actually increase the costs of buying a service from this business,” she said. “It just tells you that there’s a quick and easy way to cancel your subscription right here. And you can get a refund! If you don’t want to pay your whole bill, just click on this button.”She is not blaming consumers. They are just doing what their banks prompt them to do. “But not fighting back is sending the wrong message to consumers and card companies,” she said. “Letting the dispute go tells them that this is a sure way to get a no-questions-asked refund.”It is unclear how effective this campaign has been, and you could be forgiven for thinking that the dispute process is something of a free-for-all. After all, some service providers resort to outright intimidation to keep their dispute numbers low.The proprietors at Enchanted Attire, an online clothing retailer, wish to inform you that “you agree not to file a credit card or debit card chargeback with regard to any purchase” and that “in the event that a chargeback is placed or threatened on a purchase, we also reserve the right to report the incident for inclusion in chargeback abuser database(s) of our choosing.” Oh, and by the way, “being listed on such databases may make it more difficult or even impossible for you to use (any of) your credit card(s) on future purchases with us or other merchants.”Movers have been known to do this, too.This violates Visa’s and MasterCard’s rules, for starters, and none of the experts I spoke with this week knew of anyone keeping a database for this purpose that merchants could contribute to and that other merchants could gain access to. No one from Enchanted Attire returned my messages to shed light on this.It shouldn’t take threats to keep us in line, though. Jim Van Dyke, chief executive of Javelin Strategy and Research, suggests a simple framework for people who want to wield the dispute weapon and bask in its power but not be totally obnoxious about it.“The consumer owes the merchant one tangible shot, one wholehearted best effort to make things right,” he said. “But if they breach their commitment, then the consumer should simply escalate it and say goodbye to that merchant.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/global/british-economy-contracted-0-3-in-fourth-quarter.html,"LONDON — Britain’s economy shrank 0.3 percent at the end of 2012, according to data released Friday, with a North Sea oil production slump, lower factory output and a hangover from the London Olympics pushing it perilously close to slipping into recession for a third time since 2008.The figures from the Office for National Statistics were sharply lower than the 0.1 percent decline forecast by analysts.The news is a blow for Britain’s Conservative-led government, which a day earlier defended its austerity program against criticism from the International Monetary Fund. The government needs solid growth to meet its budget targets, keep a triple-A debt rating and bolster its chances of winning a 2015 election.The pound fell to its lowest in 13-1/2 months against the euro and hit a five-month low against the dollar in response to the data. The euro was also buoyed by a stronger-than-expected survey of German business sentiment by the Ifo Institute.“There are no positive takeaways,” said Lee Hopley, chief economist for the EEF manufacturers’ association. “Even assuming some unwinding of activity from the Olympics boost in the previous quarter, this still leaves no real signs of underlying growth in the economy.”Britain’s economy is now 3.3 percent smaller than its peak in the first quarter of 2008, having recovered only about half the output lost during the financial crisis — a worse performance than most other major economies.The country slipped back into recession in the last three months of 2011 and only emerged from it in the third quarter of 2012, after a lift from the London Olympics.After a bout of snowy weather in January — which is likely to have depressed spending and output — the risk is that the economy will continue to shrink in the first three months of this year, technically pushing it into a rare triple-dip recession.Britain’s biggest department store group, John Lewis, said Friday that snow was responsible for its sales growth stalling in the latest week.In economic terms, the picture remains one of stagnation over the past year. But politically, the latest dip in national output is more incendiary.“Stagnation is going to be the theme for the next couple of quarters or so,” said Rob Wood at Berenberg Bank.The chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne, stuck fast to his austerity plan on Thursday, rejecting suggestions from the International Monetary Fund’s chief economist that he should consider slowing his deficit reduction plan.Prime Minister David Cameron this week staked his political future on offering a referendum on Britain’s place in the European Union. But it is Mr. Osborne’s gamble that austerity will deliver strong growth before a 2015 election that will be crucial for his Conservative Party’s chance of winning.After the figures were released, Mr. Osborne conceded that Britain was still in a “very difficult economic situation”.“We face problems at home with the debts built up over many years and problems abroad, with the euro zone - where we export many of our products - deep in recession,” he added.The leader of the Liberal Democrats, Nick Clegg, has said the coalition government of which his party is a part had cut investment spending too rapidly.The finance spokesman of the opposition Labour Party, Ed Balls, responded to the data by saying the government was complacent.“David Cameron and George Osborne have been asleep at the wheel. They’ve spent the last six months obsessing about a referendum in five years time, not focusing on the problems in our economy today,” he said.The governor of the Bank of England, Mervyn A. King, has said he expects no more than a “gentle recovery” this year. This week the I.M.F. cut its 2013 forecast for British economic growth to 1.0 percent from 1.1 percent predicted in October.Economists and business groups, however, warn that even such lackluster growth could be derailed by a hit to business and consumer confidence from talk of a triple-dip recession.The biggest factor in the fourth-quarter decline in G.D.P. was a 10.2 percent drop in mining and quarrying output, the largest since records began in 1997, driven by disruption from extended maintenance affecting North Sea oil and gas fields.This knocked 0.18 percent off G.D.P., while slightly smaller amounts of damage were done by declines in factory output and in the “government and other services” category, where the Olympics had lifted sports and recreation services in the third quarter.Friday’s figures showed output in the service sector, which makes up more than three quarters of G.D.P., was flat in the fourth quarter. Industrial output was 1.8 percent lower."

The bill will begin its passage through Parliament next month and is expected to become law by midsummer. “We feel that marriage is a good thing, and we should be supporting more couples to marry,” said Maria Miller, the Conservative Party’s culture minister. The bill will allow same-sex couples who have formed a civil partnership (legal since 2004, with legal rights equivalent to those of marriage) to convert the partnerships to marriage, and enable married people to change their legal gender without having to end their union. The Church of England has raised concerns that it could be forced to conduct same-sex marriages against its will, but Ms. Miller said the bill would exempt clergy who have a conscientious objection from having to carry out the ceremonies."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/sunday-review/the-biggest-carbon-sin-air-travel.html,"LAST fall, when Democrats and Republicans seemed unable to agree on anything, one bill glided through Congress with broad bipartisan support and won a quick signature from President Obama: the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme Prohibition Act of 2011.This odd law essentially forbids United States airlines from participating in the European Union Emissions Trading System, Europe’s somewhat lonely attempt to rein in planet-warming emissions. Under that eight-year-old program, European power plants and manufacturers pay fees if they produce excess carbon emissions. The aviation sector was slated to start paying this year, too, for emissions generated by flights into or out of European Union airports.But after airlines and governments in the United States, India and China went ballistic — filing lawsuits, threatening trade actions and prompting legislation — the European Commission said it would delay full implementation for just one year to let the naysayers accede to an alternative global plan to reduce airlines’ carbon footprint.Now, with President Obama’s promise in his Inaugural Address that dealing with climate change is part of his second-term agenda, all eyes are on the United States. The United Nations’ International Civil Aviation Organization is convening a multinational meeting in September on the airlines issue, one of the thorniest in climate change.For many people reading this, air travel is their most serious environmental sin. One round-trip flight from New York to Europe or to San Francisco creates a warming effect equivalent to 2 or 3 tons of carbon dioxide per person. The average American generates about 19 tons of carbon dioxide a year; the average European, 10.So if you take five long flights a year, they may well account for three-quarters of the emissions you create. “For many people in New York City, who don’t drive much and live in apartments, this is probably going to be by far the largest part of their carbon footprint,” says Anja Kollmuss, a Zurich-based environmental consultant.It is for me. And for people like Al Gore or Richard Branson who crisscross the world, often by private jet, proclaiming their devotion to the environment.Though air travel emissions now account for only about 5 percent of warming, that fraction is projected to rise significantly, since the volume of air travel is increasing much faster than gains in flight fuel efficiency. (Also, emissions from most other sectors are falling.)Which is why, in 2008, the European Union decided to bring aviation into its emissions control plan: “We believe that those of us who can afford to pay for an air ticket can also afford to pay for the pollution from their travel,” says Connie Hedegaard, the European commissioner for climate action. “Many Europeans don’t get why, politically, this should be controversial.”Though many airlines have tried to reduce their carbon footprints through technical innovations — like more efficient aircraft designs and biofuels blends — they have successfully resisted any regulation or taxation of their emissions.In an unsuccessful lawsuit before the European Court of Justice last year, United States airlines argued in part that the European Union had no right to tax emissions on trans-Atlantic flights because they went into international airspace.Airlines for America, a trade group for United States carriers, has proposed setting emissions targets for flights from now until 2020 and adding in financial penalties only later. “The problem with the European trading scheme is that it started with a market-based measure — a tax,” says Nancy Young, the group’s vice president for environmental affairs. “We would accept a market-based mechanism only as a gap filler, if we don’t meet our targets. And we will be saying that very strongly.”She said the European scheme was “extremely burdensome” and would cost United States airlines $3.1 billion between 2012 and 2020, adding, “It takes money out of U.S. aviation and puts it into European coffers.”But some in the industry contest that view. “I think airlines typically overstate how difficult this is,” said David Hodgkinson, former director of legal services at the International Airline Transport Association, an industry group, who now practices aviation and climate law in his native Perth, Australia. “I don’t get why opposition is so fierce given that this is relatively straightforward and the cost is typically low and passed on to passengers.”He said that Qantas, the Australian airline, is going along with the European scheme, under which airlines must buy so-called carbon allowances if they exceed assigned annual emissions targets, which decrease year by year.Some analysts estimate that the European program would add about $5 to the price of a typical trans-Atlantic flight. While that may sound minimal, Ms. Young of the airline association maintained that United States airlines operate on razor-thin margins. She said, “This may be the difference between loss and profitability.”Others note that ticket prices could ultimately rise much higher as a result of the plan. The price of carbon credits varies like a stock and is now at a record low. Ms. Kollmuss, the environmental consultant, said, “If the price went up, not so many people would fly to Europe or California on such a regular basis.”This year, the European Union is collecting the emission payments on flights within Europe as per the original schedule. That has made it harder for European carriers to compete in a cutthroat industry, said Thomas Kropp, a senior vice president at Lufthansa.Ms. Hedegaard, the European Union commissioner, said that if the International Civil Aviation Organization fails to come up with a solid, market-based program in September, the European Union will begin collecting the emissions fees for all flights in and out of its airports. One way or another, prices seem bound to increase some, and perhaps that is fair. We spend more for LED light bulbs and hybrid vehicles in part because we care about the environment.At a global level, how the United States behaves in this year of airline negotiations “will be a good test” of whether President Obama will follow through on his inaugural pledge, Ms. Hedegaard said, and of “whether the U.S. is now going to engage more strongly in climate in the international arena.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/us/politics/secret-donors-finance-fight-against-hagel.html,"A brand new conservative group calling itself Americans for a Strong Defense and financed by anonymous donors is running advertisements urging Democratic senators in five states to vote against Chuck Hagel, President Obama’s nominee to be secretary of defense, saying he would make the United States “a weaker country.”Another freshly minted and anonymously backed organization, Use Your Mandate, which presents itself as a liberal gay rights group but purchases its television time through a prominent Republican firm, is attacking Mr. Hagel as “anti-Gay,” “anti-woman” and “anti-Israel” in ads and mailers.Those groups are joining at least five others that are organizing to stop Mr. Hagel’s confirmation, a goal even they acknowledge appears to be increasingly challenging. But the effort comes with a built-in consolation prize should it fail: depleting some of Mr. Obama’s political capital as he embarks on a new term with fresh momentum.The media campaign to scuttle Mr. Hagel’s appointment, unmatched in the annals of modern presidential cabinet appointments, reflects the continuing effects of the Supreme Court’s 2010 Citizens United decision, which loosened campaign finance restrictions and was a major reason for the record spending by outside groups in the 2012 election. All told, these independent and largely secretly financed groups spent well over $500 million in an attempt to defeat Mr. Obama and the Democrats, a failure that seemed all the greater given the huge amounts spent.While the campaign against Mr. Hagel, a Republican, is not expected to cost more than a few million dollars, it suggests that the operatives running the independent groups and the donors that finance them — many of whom are millionaires and billionaires with ideological drive and business agendas that did not go away after the election — are ready to fight again.“We were anxious to get back into the battle,” said Nick Ryan, a Republican strategist and the founder of the American Future Fund, which started as a small, Iowa-based political committee in 2007 and has grown larger since taking a leading role now against Mr. Hagel. “Postelection we have new battle lines being drawn with the president; he kicks it off with these nominations and it made sense for us.”Groups like his would have been able to operate freely against Mr. Hagel even before Citizens United. But the ruling has served to erase what had been traditional fears among donors that their involvement in the fight of the day would lead to legal trouble or, for those who prefer to stay anonymous, unwanted public exposure. That confidence, in turn, has helped spur the increase in the number of political organizations that pop up to engage in the big political entanglement of the moment.American Future Fund was formed under a section of the tax code that allows it to keep its donors secret. It spent more than $20 million seeking to defeat Mr. Obama and the Democrats last year, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group. Other major conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity — partly financed by the industrialist Koch family — and Crossroads GPS are not involved in the Hagel nomination, but have made it clear that they will continue to combat the president’s agenda on several fronts.The outside activity is not confined to Republicans. Mr. Obama’s campaign apparatus has transformed itself into a nonprofit political group, though it said it would disclose the names of its donors (and it is not getting involved in the Hagel fight).After Mr. Obama won re-election in November and Democrats kept their majority in the Senate and made inroads in the House, Republican Party officials and senior strategists with conservative outside groups predicted that some of the big financiers of the larger outside efforts would pull back and reassess their involvement and whether their millions were wasted. But while the donors have said they will insist that the groups they finance find lessons in last year’s losses, their interest and stakes in what happens in Washington have certainly not waned.For instance, the biggest individual financier of the so-called super PACs that sought to defeat Mr. Obama, Sheldon Adelson, is so invested in the fight over Mr. Hagel that he has reached out directly to Republican Senators to urge them to hold the line against his confirmation, which would be almost impossible to stop against six Republican “yes” votes and a unified Democratic caucus.Given the more than $100 million he donated to the anti-Obama effort last year, no lawmakers need to be reminded of his importance to their future endeavors. People briefed on his involvement said Mr. Adelson, chairman of the Las Vegas Sands Corporation and a longtime supporter of Israel, was calling in conjunction with the Republican Jewish Coalition, a group he has financed for several years.In an interview with The Wall Street Journal in December, Mr. Adelson said he was prepared to “double” his investment in politics in the coming year.But it is unclear whether he is directly financing any of the anti-Hagel advertising. An associate of his, speaking about Mr. Adelson’s thinking on condition of anonymity, said he did not believe that expensive television campaigns are the answer to every political push given that Mr. Obama’s re-election team accomplished so much of its success through online and volunteer efforts.Citing similar reasons, another major Republican donor, Foster Friess, said in an interview that he had developed his own skepticism over “the whole idea of these multimedia ads from 45,000 feet.” After last year’s losses he said he was devoting most of his resources to an effort he called “Left-Right, Left-Right Forward March,” which finds projects liberals and conservatives can support together, like water purification in developing countries.Still, he said, “no one in this effort is going to give up the values that they think are important.” For him, that extends to Mr. Hagel, whose “past statements about Israel should be really taken into consideration” Mr. Friess said, adding, “and I would hope they could find a better person to serve in that position.”Whatever its chances of success, the blitz against Mr. Hagel is of a sort that has generally been reserved for elections and some Supreme Court nominations. The last major cabinet skirmish, over President George W. Bush’s nomination of John R. Bolton as the United States ambassador to the United Nations, had no comparable outside media blitz. Though goaded along by a phone campaign organized by the political action arm of the liberal group MoveOn, Democrats succeeded in blocking him in the Senate, forcing Mr. Bush to appoint him during a congressional recess.That was before the Citizens United decision.“This is the first big cabinet fight since Bolton,” said Michael Goldfarb, a strategist for a conservative group opposed to Mr. Hagel called the Emergency Committee for Israel and a founder of a conservative Web site called The Washington Free Beacon, which is running a steady stream of anti-Hagel news articles. “And things have evolved in the last seven years.”The most mysterious of the new groups is Use Your Mandate. Portraying itself as a gay rights group, it has sent mailers to voters in seven states — including New York, New Jersey, Maryland and Montana — and run television ads against Mr. Hagel in New York and Washington. It has sent out posts on Twitter questioning his gay rights record and asking, “Is this what we worked so hard for?” Established gay rights activists have expressed skepticism about the group’s authenticity.It has no Web site and it only lists as its address a post office box in New York. But paperwork filed with the Federal Communications Commission link it back to Tusk Strategies, a bipartisan political group founded by Bradley Tusk, a former strategist for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York.In an interview, Mr. Tusk would only identify its financiers as Democratic “gay and L.G.B.T. people who have been active in campaigns around the country.”Yet federal records show that Use Your Mandate uses Del Cielo Media, an arm of one of the most prominent Republican ad-buying firms in the country, Smart Media, with clients that have included the presidential campaigns of former Gov. Jon M. Huntsman Jr. of Utah and Senator John McCain of Arizona; the 2010 Senate campaign of Christine O’Donnell, who was known for positions against homosexuality, in Delaware; and, as it happens, the Emergency Committee for Israel."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/your-money/when-customer-service-is-a-dead-end-street.html,"SEVERAL readers have surprised the Haggler by rising to the defense of McDonald’s and its in-store ad for the McRib sandwich — “It’s real pork!” — as described in our last episode. The ad suggests that McDonald’s thinks that its customers have pathetically low expectations about the chain’s raw materials. Just as bad, it breaks the Haggler’s unwritten rule that companies should never boast about the realness of any product that consumers have every right to assume is real.Au contraire, argued a fearless few. One reader said he thought McDonald’s might simply be trying to alert people who don’t eat pork — Muslims and kosher-observant Jews, for instance.But would someone with a dietetic restriction against pork ever even consider ordering something called a McRib? Even if the answer is yes, there is another problem here. If the point of the ad is to give a heads-up to the pork-averse, it would need only say “It’s pork!” The world “real” in this context is unnecessary.Of course, if McDonald’s posted ads for the McRib that merely stated “It’s pork!” the subtext of the ad would be, “We believe our customers are really stupid.”Someone else argued that the ad helps because pigs aren’t the only animals with ribs that are barbecued. Beef ribs are popular, too. Fair enough. Yet, again, if the goal is to eliminate any doubts about the origins of the meat, “It’s pork!” would suffice. No need for “real.”But another reader made a point that the Haggler believes must be shared.“I thought you were going to note that there are no ribs in the McRib,” wrote Jack Schwartz of Baltimore. “It’s parts of the pig that have been formed to look like ribs.”Actually, according to a McDonald’s spokeswoman quoted in a Business Insider article in December, the McRib is made of “simple ground pork.” Which sounds like a combination of pig parts that could very well include ribs. But the rib look of the McRib — that is indeed an illusion.So perhaps a more illuminating slogan might be “McRib: Only the look is fake!” That might not sell as many sandwiches, but it is certainly more informative.O.K., letter time.Q. On May 9, 2012, a certificate of title was awarded to Bank of America as part of a foreclosure on property I own — a vacant lot that I had hoped to build on. But Bank of America has continued to report delinquent payments to credit-score agencies, like Equifax. This means that I could have bad credit reports for all eternity, with no hope of ever improving my credit score.Rectifying this problem has proved impossible. The call-in procedure at Bank of America seems designed to frustrate. No one seems to know the correct number to call. When I finally reached service reps, they were not allowed to call me back and could only repeat a robotic litany: “We have no record of a foreclosure sale. Would you like to make a payment?” I finally reached a supervisor, but she would not provide me with a direct number.  I had to go  through another generic number.  Two people who answered said they did not know who my contact person was.  “We have no knowledge of a foreclosure sale,” onesaid. Round and round we go.Can you help?  CONRAD REVAKNaples, Fla.A. First, the Haggler would like to point out that this is the first mortgage-related question ever posted in this space. That seems crazy, given that millions of Americans have been complaining for years that their bank won’t return calls or has mishandled paperwork, entered incorrect data and so on. Mortgages surely have caused more consumer heartburn than anything else since the housing crisis began.But for some reason, only a handful of people have ever thought the Haggler could help. And the other cases were either too convoluted or were resolved before interventions could be made.So you think the Haggler can’t handle a mortgage? Phooey. If you’ve got a good, clear case and can summarize it in less than 300 words, do share.In this instance, the Haggler wrote to Bank of America, which resolved the entire problem in about a day and a half. The details here are that Mr. Revak — or more specifically, his lawyer — asked a court to grant what is called a deed-in-lieu, a financial instrument that lets a borrower give the title of a property to a bank, bypassing the standard and more arduous foreclosure proceeding.A spokeswoman at Bank of America, Jumana Bauwens, said the wheels were grinding slowly in Mr. Revak’s case because his deed-in-lieu approach was unusual, and the “bank’s legal team felt they needed to do some more research to ensure that we wouldn’t have title issues when we sold the property in the future.”O.K., but what’s up with the Bank of America’s phone system, which runs customers from one dead end to another? Might the company want to rethink that issue?The Haggler tried to get the spokeswoman to say anything about this subject, but with no success. Which is maddening. How about just telling the Haggler that it’s working on the phone problem, or wants to, or is really bummed that it hasn’t already? Anything would be better than ignoring the issue.As for Mr. Revak, he wrote to say that Bank of America got in touch by phone with a whole new and far more helpful attitude. Apologies were offered, and a promise was made that the bank would contact the credit scoring agencies and correct the record.If Bank of America follows through with that promise, Mr. Revak wrote, “I will consider the case closed. The big unanswered question, though, is how many Americans are taking a hit on their credit score for no reason?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/your-money/apple-stock-isnt-a-bellwether-even-if-its-big.html,"THE rise of Apple shares over the last few years was meteoric. Their fall over last few days has been traumatic. But these gyrations may not matter much to the overall stock market.They will matter, of course, if you lost money as Apple dropped from $702 in September to $439.88 on Friday. And the company’s struggles may be of more than passing interest even if you never intend to own any of its shares.Apple remains a colossus, even if Exxon Mobil surpassed it as the most valuable publicly traded company in the world on Friday, exactly one year after iPhone sales propelled Apple to the top spot. Still, all of those iPhones, iPads and other gadgets make Apple matter in many households.But the company’s influence on the stock market is another question. Aside from the drag that Apple’s decline has imposed on indexes that include it, its recent travails haven’t affected other stocks very much, and they don’t provide much information about the market as a whole. That’s the view of Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, who has some statistics to support it.“The company just isn’t the market bellwether,” he said.In good times and bad, Apple has largely gone its own way, and the rest of the market hasn’t followed its lead. Apple isn’t nearly as influential as, say, I.B.M., which appears to be the true market bellwether, Mr. Hickey contends.I.B.M. is the market leader — the stock that other stocks follow — based on Bespoke’s calculations, which are boiled down into one statistic. That is the likelihood that a stock’s return on the day after its quarterly earnings report matches the direction of the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index over the next five weeks.Over the last decade, for example, the rise or fall of I.B.M. stock on the day after the company reports earnings has matched the S.& P. 500’s direction 75 percent of the time. That’s the highest percentage for any stock in the index over that period. The comparable figure for Apple is only 37.5 percent.If those tendencies continue — and that’s a big “if” — bulls have reason to cheer. Both companies issued earnings reports last week, and they received very different reactions in the market. After the close of trading on Tuesday, I.B.M. reported rising profits on a modest decline in revenue, and the market reaction was strikingly positive. I.B.M. shares rose 4.4 percent on Wednesday. If I.B.M. is the market bellwether, it implies that over the next five weeks, the overall market is likely to rise.Apple, on the other hand, reported earnings after hours on Wednesday, and the market reaction was brutal. Apple’s guidance for 2013 disappointed analysts — its profit was flat although its revenue grew — and its shares fell more than 12 percent on Thursday. But Apple isn’t a bellwether, Mr. Hickey says. Its earnings reports and its returns the next day have not matched the market’s subsequent five-week direction with any regularity.Looking at the short term, Apple shares have often moved quite independently of the rest of the market, too. On Thursday, for example, the S.& P. 500 was flat for the day despite the steep drop of Apple, which accounts for more than 3 percent of the index. The Dow Jones industrial average, in which I.B.M. has the greatest weight, at more than 11 percent, doesn’t include Apple at all, and it rose slightly for the day. On Wednesday, by contrast, both indexes rose, along with I.B.M. and Apple shares.Why should the market’s one-day reaction to I.B.M.’s earnings have anything to do with market returns over the next five weeks? Mr. Hickey speculates that I.B.M., which provides sophisticated, integrated digital solutions to business problems, now derives revenue from many of the world’s big companies and accurately reflects the prospects of corporate America. “When I.B.M. is doing well, a lot of the corporations in America are doing well,” he says.But it’s quite possible that the apparent connection between I.B.M.’s earnings and the overall market direction is nothing more than an anomaly, and may not continue.That’s the assessment of Burton G. Malkiel, the Princeton economist and author of “A Random Walk Down Wall Street,” the investment book now in its 10th edition. He has found that, for the most part, the stock market does not follow predictable patterns.“If it did,” Professor Malkiel says, “money managers would be able to beat the market regularly, but the vast majority of them can’t.”Mr. Hickey says he isn’t sure what to make of the I.B.M.-market connection, either. I.B.M.’s role as a bellwether is plausible because it is such a well-established company and touches so many industries. But other companies that score highly as bellwethers don’t have a reach wide enough to look like natural leaders of the entire market, he says. After I.B.M., his statistics show that the next four companies, in descending order of influence, are Harmon International, the maker of audio and electronic systems; Altera, the semiconductor company; the Ball Corporation, which provides packaging for consumer products and aerospace technologies for commercial and governmental customers; and Cooper Tire and Rubber.Then again, being a bellwether is an informal designation, and in its original meaning, it wasn’t entirely positive. The word’s etymology makes that clear: a wether is a castrated male sheep, and a bellwether is one of those emasculated sheep with a bell hanging around its neck. Shepherds use bellwethers to lead other sheep around. Writers and market analysts use the word as a metaphor for a leader, and have done so for decades.Through the years, traders, analysts and journalists have designated many a market bellwether, including United States Steel, General Motors, AT&T, RCA, Chrysler, DuPont, the New York Central Railroad, Consolidated Edison, Intel, Microsoft, Cisco Systems, Citigroup, General Electric and the 30-year Treasury bond. I.B.M. has been called a bellwether, on and off, since at least the 1970s.PROFESSOR MALKIEL agrees that Apple isn’t a bellwether, but he doubts that any company is. He says he believes in the wisdom of long-term, buy-and-hold investing in low-cost index funds and advises against seeking hidden market patterns caused by bellwethers or much anything else.Basing the market’s five-week direction on its one-day reaction to I.B.M. earnings is too simple to be plausible, he said. “If you search through data deeply enough you’ll find all kinds of connections,” he said. “But are they real? If you believe this one is, you can go out and bet your money on it. But I can tell you that I won’t be doing that.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/opinion/sunday/the-tijuana-connection-a-template-for-growth.html,"SAN DIEGOIN November I quit my job as the editor of Wired to run 3D Robotics, the San Diego-based drone company I started with a partner as a side project three years ago. We make autopilot technology and small aircraft — both planes and multirotor copters — that can fly by themselves. The drones, which sell for a few hundred bucks, are for civilians: they don’t shoot anything but photographs and videos. And they’re incredibly fun to build (which we do with the ample help of robots). It wasn’t a hard decision to give up publishing for this.But my company, like many manufacturers, is faced with a familiar challenge: its main competitors are Chinese companies that have the dual advantages of cheap labor and top-notch engineering. So, naturally, when we were raising a round of investment financing last year, venture capitalists demanded a plausible explanation for how our little start-up could beat its Chinese rivals. The answer was as much a surprise to the investors as it had been to me a few years earlier: Mexico. In particular, Tijuana.Like many Americans, until recently, when I heard “Tijuana” I thought only of drug cartels and cheap tequila. “TJ,” though, is a city of more than two million people (larger than neighboring San Diego), and it has become North America’s electronics assembly hot spot: most of the flat-screen TVs sold in the United States, from companies like Samsung and Sony, are made there, along with everything from medical devices to aerospace parts. Jordi Muñoz, the smart young guy who had taught me about drones and then started 3D Robotics with me, is from TJ — and he persuaded me to build a second factory there to supplement the work we were doing in San Diego.Shuttling between the two factories — in San Diego, where we engineer our drones, and in TJ, where we assemble them — I’m reminded of a similar experience I had a decade earlier. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, I lived in Hong Kong (working for The Economist) and saw how that city was paired with the “special economic zone” of Shenzhen across the border on the Chinese mainland in Guangdong Province. Together, the two created a world-beating manufacturing hub: business, design and finance in Hong Kong, manufacturing in Shenzhen. The clear division of labor between the two became a model for modern China.Today, what Shenzhen is to Hong Kong, Tijuana is becoming to San Diego. You can drive from our San Diego engineering center to our Tijuana factory in 20 minutes, no passport required. (A passport is needed to come back, but there are fast-track lanes for business people.) Some of our employees commute across the border each day; good doctors are cheaper and easier to find in TJ, as are private schools, although it’s generally nicer to live in San Diego. In some ways, the border feels more like the notional borders of the European Union than a divide between the developed and developing worlds.And it’s not just TJ. To the east, in Juárez, Dell computers are built by Foxconn, the company that manufactures more than 40 percent of the world’s electronics (including Apple’s iPhone and iPad). To the south, in Querétaro, a factory builds the transmissions that General Motors installs in its Corvettes. The design of General Electric’s GEnx turbine jet engine and the production of interior elements of Boeing’s 787 Dreamliner also happen in Mexico. Manufactured goods are the country’s chief export, with private investment in this sector among the highest in the world.The notion that Mexico offers only cheap labor is just plain off the mark. Mexico graduates some 115,000 engineering students per year — roughly three times as many as the U.S. on a per-capita basis. One result is that some machine specialists are typically easier to find in TJ than in many big American cities. So, for that matter, are accountants experienced in production economics and other highly skilled workers.What all these pieces add up to is a model — one that might hold the long-sought answer for how American manufacturers can compete with those in China, India and the next generation of economic powerhouses. That’s because the TJ template isn’t so much about outsourcing as it is quicksourcing. And that’s also the way to create thousands of good jobs in the United States.As any entrepreneur can tell you, the shorter and more nimble a supply chain is, the better.First, a shorter supply chain means that a company can make things when it wants to, instead of solely when it has to. Strange as it may seem, many small manufacturers don’t have that option. When we started 3D, we produced everything in China and needed to order in units of thousands to get good pricing. That meant that we had to write big checks to make big batches of goods — money we wouldn’t see again until all those products sold, sometimes a year or more later. Now that we carry out our production locally, we’re able to make only what we need that week.Second, there’s less risk. If we make an error in a design, we’ve wasted at most a few days’ worth of production. If there’s something wrong in the production process itself, we can spot it fast. We control the component inventory, so we can see what’s going into our goods and know that we’re not being ripped off with used or pirated parts. And if we want to protect our intellectual property, we can do so without having to trust that other companies will uphold our interests above all others. And that’s saying nothing about political risk, environmental risk or P.R. risk, all of which companies like Apple and Walmart have learned about in China the hard way.Third, it’s simply faster. We still order some parts from China, and even though we use FedEx, it always seems to take weeks, and sometimes months, longer than we’d planned. That’s not a criticism of China; it’s merely intrinsic to any arm’s-length relationship between small buyers and big makers. If we were Apple, we’d get overnight service. But we’re not, so we wait.Finally, a short supply chain is an incentive to innovate. If you’re outsourcing the manufacturing of huge parcels of a product, you can’t change that product until you’ve sold all the ones you’ve already made (at least not if you want to stay in business). So that often means sitting on your hands, waiting for Version 1 to sell out before starting to make Version 2. But when you’re doing just-in-time manufacturing, you can change the product every day if you want — whether to take advantage of some better or cheaper component or to improve the design.In the land of the long supply chain, meanwhile, things are changing, too. Inflation-adjusted labor costs in China have more than tripled in the past decade. Wages in China’s southern cities are approaching $6 an hour, roughly what they are in Mexico.Whether factors like these are enough to turn American businesses from outsourcers to quicksourcers remains an open question. But I’m betting my money that they will. The sense of possibility I felt when I first crossed from Hong Kong to Shenzhen in 1997 is what I now feel when I cross from San Diego to Tijuana. The trade routes of the 21st century don’t have to follow Marco Polo from West to East. Indeed, in the new manufacturing landscape, the routes don’t have to take you far at all."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/jobs/how-job-seekers-can-say-look-at-me-to-online-recruiters.html,"IF you are thinking of looking for a job this year, or are already searching for one, be warned: for some job seekers, the rules have changed. Technology and social media have altered the way some employers consider candidates. Simply sifting through job postings and sending out applications en masse was never a good route to success, and is even less so now.One of the most important questions that many job seekers can ask these days is this: How searchable am I? Some employers aren’t even bothering to post jobs, but are instead searching online for the right candidate, said Barbara Safani, owner of Career Solvers, a career management firm in New York.Not having an Internet presence can be damaging, Ms. Safani said. She is among those who recommend that job seekers spend serious time detailing their skills and experience on commercial sites like LinkedIn and Twitter, with an eye toward making their names a magnet for search engines.“Having a blog can be a good way to show that you are a thought leader” while improving your professional visibility, she said. And consider YouTube as a way to enhance your searchability, she advised. If an employer comes across a video of you giving a speech or a training presentation, she said, you may gain an advantage.More companies are turning to Twitter as a way to broadcast job openings, so you should use it to follow recruiters, industry leaders and individual companies, said Alison Doyle, a job search specialist for About.com. She said that by linking to articles and sharing your expertise on Twitter, you can enhance your professional reputation — though you should beware of the site’s potential as a time drain.On Facebook, “liking” a company can mean receiving early notice of job openings and other news. But privacy concerns make Facebook tricky, Ms. Doyle said: Make sure you understand who is receiving which of your posts, or resolve to be thoroughly professional on Facebook at all times, she said. Be aware that hiring managers may see what you post on any of the major social media outlets, she added.OLD-FASHIONED, personal networking can still be an effective way to land a job, but online networking now supplements it in many fields. Both Ms. Safani and Ms. Doyle say LinkedIn is a very important Web tool for making those connections.The site offers premium services for a fee, but almost all of the main features for job seekers are free, Ms. Doyle said. Spend a few minutes on the site each day making new connections, she advised, and keep your profile up to date.To improve the chances that a connection request will be accepted, especially from someone you don’t know, send a personal message along with it, noting, say, your similar backgrounds, said Nicole Williams, a consultant who works as a career expert for LinkedIn.Baldly asking someone at a company for help in landing a job is never a good idea, on LinkedIn or anywhere else. Share links and advice with people in your LinkedIn network before asking for a favor like an introduction to a hiring manager or a written recommendation that would appear on the site. If you are seeking a particular position, Ms. Doyle said, you might say something like: “I’m interested in this job. Do you have any information that you can share with me?”Joining industry groups on LinkedIn can build your visibility. You can also join college alumni organizations or other focused groups, like one for working mothers.Make full use of the skills section of LinkedIn, Ms. Williams advised, and the more specific you are, the better. Instead of saying that you have marketing skills, note the exact areas — direct mail campaigns, for example. LinkedIn can direct you to companies that are seeking these skills so you can follow them. Listing your skills could also bring you to the notice of a recruiter.Be aware, too, that an employer may be viewing your application via a mobile phone. Mobile traffic involving job search more than doubled in 2012 over 2011 at the employment site Indeed.com, said Rony Kahan, a co-founder and C.E.O. So make sure you know how your résumé and cover letter look on a small screen. Résumés should be in a PDF format so they can be viewed on a variety of phones.In the age of online applications, one school of thought holds that cover letters are a waste of time, but Ms. Doyle disagrees. Cover letters are still a great way to differentiate yourself from the competition, she said — and the rise of applications via cellphone just means they should be more concise, and specific to the job at hand."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/movies/awardsseason/gatekeepers-oscar-nominee-has-muted-reaction-in-israel.html,"JERUSALEM — The Oscar-nominated documentary “The Gatekeepers” braids the recollections and reflections of six former chiefs of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, into a disturbing narrative of their country’s occupation of the Palestinian territories since 1967. In the United States the confessions of these tough terrorist hunters have startled and provoked audiences, fueling the criticism among Jewish liberals of the right-leaning Israeli government’s expansion of settlements in the West Bank.But one of the subjects of the film, Ami Ayalon — who followed his Shin Bet tenure with several years in Parliament — worries that the film will have less impact where it is most important, because “most Israelis who saw it are Israelis who are convinced.”“Most Israelis are not listening,” Mr. Ayalon, who ran the Shin Bet from 1996 to 2000, said in an interview. “When it is too tough, the easiest way to deal with it is to close our eyes and to close our ears.”The big question is whether the 97-minute, $1.5 million “Gatekeepers” will change that. It has already captured the attention of the world: at least 10 American film critics, including two from The New York Times, put it in their best-of-2012 lists, and Israel’s Foreign Ministry gets inquiries almost daily from its embassies about how to handle the reaction in countries where “The Gatekeepers” will soon be screened. (After an Oscar-qualifying run last year the movie opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday.)Here in Israel the film has received positive reviews and praise by newspaper columnists since its festival premiere last summer and opening on Jan. 1 but has not exactly started a revolution. The issues it raises were not, for example, a factor in the elections on Tuesday. By last Sunday about 22,000 people here had seen the film — a lot for an Israeli documentary but still a tiny fraction of the population of nearly eight million.The message of “The Gatekeepers,” formed from the collective wisdom of the six living former Shin Bet leaders, is this: The occupation is immoral and, perhaps more important, ineffective. Israel should withdraw from the West Bank as it did from the Gaza Strip in 2005. And the prospect of a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict diminishes daily, threatening the future of Israel as a Jewish democracy.(The film also confronts internal Jewish terrorism, including the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and a plot to blow up the Temple Mount in the 1980s.)While public opinion polls show most Israeli Jews still support the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, increasing numbers have lost faith that it could happen in their lifetimes.“The question is whether those people who believe there is no one to talk with, nothing to talk about, and we are condemned to go on fighting and killing for the next 10 generations — and they are supported and empowered by our political community — whether they will be open to see the different view,” Mr. Ayalon said. “Probably it is too difficult.”Dror Moreh, the 51-year-old director of the film, said over coffee recently that its power is not so much the message as the messengers. He got the idea for “The Gatekeepers” while working on a 2008 documentary about former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, whose chief of staff described a  2003 article in an Israeli newspaper that quoted Shin Bet leaders as critical in persuading Mr. Sharon, once called the father of the settlements, to evacuate those in the Gaza Strip. “The Fog of War,” Errol Morris’s 2003 documentary about the lessons that Robert S. McNamara, the former United States defense secretary, learned during Vietnam, was also a source of inspiration.One or two dissenters from the security establishment can be dismissed as having gone soft or having an ax to grind, Mr. Moreh said, but not all six former chiefs of the Shin Bet since 1980. They talk with a mix of pride and shame about brutal interrogations and deadly operations, with one referring to a particular assassination as “very clean and elegant.” They are not your typical peaceniks. (Though the film’s opening title card says the men had never been interviewed before, that is not technically true. Four of them broke their agency’s code of silence for the 2003 article, and the others have spoken out since.)“They know better than anybody else,” Mr. Moreh said of his subjects. “They have been there, they have done the work.” He added, “Any Israeli who is not corrupted ideologically, who when he looks in the mirror he doesn’t say the mirror is crooked, will have to listen eventually to what they are saying.”What are they saying? “In the war against terror forget about morality.” That’s Avraham Shalom, who resigned in disgrace in 1986 after ordering the killing of two Palestinians who had hijacked a bus. “You can’t make peace using military means,” says Avi Dichter, who ran the agency from 2000 to 2005 and is now home front minister.Mr. Ayalon: “You ask yourself less and less where to stop.”Mr. Shalom again: “There was no strategy, just tactics.”Yaakov Peri, who was elected to Parliament last week as a member of the new centrist There Is a Future party: “When you leave the Shin Bet, you become a bit of a leftist.”Mr. Moreh said that as a child in the tough Jerusalem neighborhood Kiryat Yovel he “used to run from school to a cinema that showed three movies in one sitting.”He devoured westerns, science fiction, and monster movies, he recalled, “just to forget about everything and go into this charm of being in the cinema and allow myself to be sucked into a completely new reality, a completely new world of whatever I wanted to see.”Yet when he became a filmmaker he turned his lens on the reality around him. “Look, I live in Israel,” he said. “To do movies like ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ and, let’s say, ‘The Hobbit,’ is something that you do out of pleasure. The troubles going on in Israel oblige you to create films that seem more, I would say, important.”Besides the Sharon documentary he also directed a 2003 documentary about an Israeli journalist in the Iraq war. He is turning “The Gatekeepers” into a five-part series for Israeli television and a book.“The Gatekeepers” is actually one of two Israeli films about the occupation to be nominated for the best documentary Oscar this year. The other, “Five Broken Cameras,” is a $250,000, intimate movie mostly of video shot by a Palestinian who spent years at weekly protests of Israel’s separation barrier encroaching on his West Bank village. Mr. Moreh’s, in contrast, is slick and makes rare documentary use of computer-generated imagery.As the Shin Bet directors describe operations, viewers often see a bank of monitors seemingly tracking the movement of suspected terrorists via drone cameras; they were created for the film. Ditto with the supposed Shin Bet file cabinets, dossiers and maps of collaborator locations. The video of the bus hijacking was invented digitally from a handful of still photographs shot by journalists that night.“I won’t tell you when it is real and when it is recreated,” Mr. Moreh said. “When you see the film nobody can tell.”The Israeli press has mostly praised the film. Uri Klein, film critic of the liberal daily Haaretz, called it “one of the most intelligent, mature and self-disciplined documentaries that have been made here recently.” Ariel Rubinstein, a professor of economics at Tel Aviv University and a longtime activist in the peace movement, described it in an essay in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot as “the dream document of those who wish to convince by the power of words just how devastating the occupation is.”But Aluf Benn, the editor of Haaretz, wrote in a recent column that the film is “convenient for the Shin Bet,” painting its chiefs as victims of the political leadership and going light on their own bending of the law. Palestinians, Mr. Benn complained, “are depicted in the film as stereotypes: an Arab and a donkey in black and white, youths throwing stones, a screaming mob running behind an ambulance.”Ofra Ben Yaacov, an official in the Foreign Ministry’s culture division, said she considered the movie a must-see for Israeli ambassadors and their aides abroad, despite its devastating criticism of government policy, if only so that they can engage critics.“Of course it’s a little problematic if you’re talking from the point of hasbarah,” Ms. Ben Yaacov said, using a Hebrew term for propaganda. “If we are trying to export our art in all different fields, the question is whether it will be better to take only things that are good to Israel, that don’t ask any questions, that don’t raise any dilemmas. From my point of view the answer is not — you have to be open and not be a censor.”A spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the prime minister had not seen “The Gatekeepers” and had no plans to. Mr. Moreh, whose dream “is to go to the White House and show the film to Obama,” said Mr. Netanyahu had also not sent a message of congratulations about the Oscar nomination.And if he wins?“I’m not expecting him to call me,” Mr. Moreh said. “I would ask him to go and see the film and to think over what is said in the film from the people who are most responsible for the security of the state of Israel.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/jobs/paul-gaynor-of-first-wind-on-learning-from-setbacks.html,"MY younger sister, Maureen, was born with cerebral palsy. That shaped my view of the world, as I saw the challenges that she and my parents had to deal with.My sister went to special schools for years. She graduated from college and is doing well, but it made me appreciate all she had to go through and all I had. I look at people with disabilities personally.After high school, I started at Worcester Polytechnic Institute as a computer science major, and I failed my first computer science course. The phone call to my dad to tell him did not go well. I switched to mechanical engineering and found it more intuitive.I graduated in 1987 and got a job at the power systems division of General Electric. The company hired engineers for its technical sales program and had them rotate among departments. After training, I worked in Boston selling gas and steam turbines.After working there for four years, I attended the University of Chicago for an M.B.A., then joined what is now GE Energy Financial Services for five years, most of the time as vice president and manager in Singapore. I next worked as senior vice president and chief financial officer for a start-up pipeline development company in London that G.E. owned with another company.That start-up lit an entrepreneurial fire under me. It was highly risky and didn’t succeed, but it was an unbelievable learning experience.In 2000, I got a job with the Singapore Power Group. The Singapore government was privatizing state-run industries and brought me in for my C.F.O. experience, to help it adopt some Western business practices and ready the organization for the public markets. An I.P.O. never took place, however. When the country’s telephone utility went public the shares dropped, so the government changed its mind.I left by mutual agreement, then joined a few colleagues from G.E. who had started an investment company in 2003 to take advantage of the disruption in the power market after the Enron bankruptcy and the California energy crisis. It was another high-risk proposition, and we stayed at it for a year but did not do well.In 2004, another G.E. colleague asked me to join UPC Wind Management as president and chief executive, and I accepted. Because another wind company had a similar name, we changed our name to First Wind in 2008.First Wind has 16 wind farms totaling nearly 1,000 megawatts of wind power, the equivalent of supplying power to 300,000 homes. Some people will always be against development, whether it’s a shopping mall, a condo project or a wind farm. But before going ahead, we do a large amount of research on the effect of sound and the impact on roads, water, views, and avian and other habitats. Our studies then go to an agency that issues permits. The agency reviews the documentation, typically has hearings and then decides whether to assign a permit.Failure has influenced my perspectives on business. I learned more from my couple of negative experiences than from the successes. Failure has made me skeptical about outcomes, which has influenced how I run First Wind. We take credit for something only when it actually happens and not a second before, because you can get burned in the final seconds of a deal.In 1994, I was in a plane accident at La Guardia Airport in New York. The plane aborted takeoff in a snowstorm, and in the 15 seconds before we hit the ground I thought I was going to die. Then we skidded off the runway. That event was life-altering. I travel a lot, and since then I’ve made good choices about flying and weather."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/business/housing-markets-future-still-has-many-clouds.html,"WE’RE beginning to hear noises that we’ve reached a major turning point in the housing market — and that, with interest rates so low, this is a rare opportunity to buy. But are such observations on target?It would be comforting if they were. Yet the unfortunate truth is that the tea leaves don’t clearly suggest any particular path for prices, either up or down.On the one hand, there were sharp price increases in 2012, with the S.&P./Case-Shiller 20-City Index, which I helped devise, up a total of 9 percent over the six months from March to September. That comes after what was generally a decline in prices for five consecutive years. And while prices dropped very slightly in October, the trend was quite encouraging for the market. (Our November data come out on Tuesday.)But some of these changes were seasonal. Home prices have tended to rise every midyear and to fall slightly every fall and winter. And for some unknown reason, seasonal effects have become more pronounced since the financial crisis.After screening out these effects, a number of indicators are up, including data for housing starts and permits as well as the National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Index  of traffic of prospective homebuyers, which has made a spectacular rebound since last spring.What might explain this picture? It’s hard to pin down, because nothing drastically different occurred in the economy from March to September. Yes, there was economic improvement: the unemployment rate, for example, dropped to 7.8 percent from 8.2 percent. But that extended a trend in place since 2009. There was also a decline in foreclosure activity, but for the most part that is also a continuing trend, as reported by RealtyTrac.And, last spring, along with Karl Case of Wellesley College and Anne Thompson of McGraw-Hill Construction, I conducted a detailed survey of the attitudes of recent home buyers in four American cities, as I discussed here in October. We did not see any evidence of increased optimism.In short, it is hard to find an exact cause for the rebound in home prices. But that isn’t unusual — we hardly ever know the real causes of major changes in speculative prices. Yet we do know that any short-run increase in inflation-adjusted home prices has been virtually worthless as an indicator of where home prices will be going over the next five or more years.THERE is a good deal of short-run momentum in home prices — they tend to keep going in the same direction for a year or maybe more. But those prices have generally reverted to the mean fairly quickly, in inflation-corrected terms. The upswing in home prices from 1997 to 2006 — up 86 percent, in real terms — was an anomaly. And that upswing was almost completely reversed by 2012. We certainly can’t rule out another boom. It’s possible that the 20th-century pattern of real home prices, which typically hugged the historical mean, has disappeared. Perhaps people are more speculative in their thinking, after the recent roller-coaster ride, and more prepared psychologically to buy into a bubble. But I wouldn’t put any money on that.History doesn’t suggest that another big bubble will come so fast. In fact, before the most recent one, the United States had had only one major national home price boom in the last century,  when real prices rose a total of 68 percent from 1942 to 1953.After the traumatic collapse of the last price bubble, Americans seem less sanguine about owning versus renting. According to the Census Bureau, the homeownership rate has been falling, from 69.0 percent in the third quarter of 2006 to 65.5 percent in the third quarter last year.A study of the causes of these rate movements, by Stuart Gabriel of the University of California, Los Angeles, and Stuart Rosenthal of Syracuse University, concluded that further declines seem likely, but that a forecast would depend “on uncertain forecasts of attitudes toward investing in homeownership as well as changes in credit market and other economic conditions.” (The study was presented at the January meetings of the American Real Estate and Urban Economics Association/American Economic Association.) If the trend continues, it would suggest long-term declines in prices of existing detached single-family homes, because they are costly to manage as rentals.The housing market has also been subject to new oversight, including that of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which just this month announced new ability-to-repay standards for mortgage lenders. Those standards will make wild lending harder to do.So it seems that since 2006, our society — including both buyers and lenders — hasn’t become more speculative in its attitudes toward housing. Instead, it has become more wary, and more regulated.And, of course, economic clouds are still hovering. Slow overall growth continues in the United States, and European financial markets remain vulnerable.Much of our economy, notably housing, is still supported by taxpayer bailouts, which are clearly not a long-term solution. There are also lingering uncertainties about emerging-market economies, as well as the risk that a disturbance in the Middle East could cause an energy crisis.Most experts are not predicting any big change in home prices. As of December, the Zillow-Pulsenomics Home Price Expectations Survey, which involves more than 100 forecasters, and the S.& P. Case/Shiller Composite Index Futures were both forecasting modest increases for the next half-decade, implying inflation-adjusted price growth of 1 to 2 percent a year.The bottom line for potential home buyers or sellers is probably this: Don’t do anything dramatic or difficult. There is too much uncertainty to justify any aggressive speculative moves right now. If you have personal reasons for getting into or out of the housing market, go ahead. Otherwise, don’t stay up worrying about home prices any more than you do about stock prices.I can’t offer any clearer picture, and I don’t see a solid basis for anyone else to do so, either."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/ryan-says-obama-ignores-fiscal-woes-to-fight-gop.html,"Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the former vice-presidential candidate, said on Sunday that President Obama was ignoring the nation’s problems and was choosing instead to focus on the “political conquest” of the Republican Party.“When you saw his speech, say, at the inauguration, it leads us to conclude that he’s not looking to moderate, that he’s not looking to move to the middle,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview on the NBC News program “Meet the Press.” “He’s looking to go farther to the left, and he wants to fight us every step of the way politically.”In his first major interview since the November election, Mr. Ryan also warned that more partisan gridlock was in store as lawmakers prepared to renew the debate over balancing the budget and raising the country’s debt limit. His remarks echoed those of other Republican leaders, including Speaker John A. Boehner, who said last week that Mr. Obama was seeking to “annihilate” the Republican Party.Republicans were put on the defensive after Mr. Obama’s inauguration speech, in which he laid out a starkly liberal vision for his second term, declaring his support for same-sex marriage, gun restrictions and changes in immigration laws.With his stature increased within the party, Mr. Ryan, who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, will increasingly be expected to set the tone for Republicans, particularly on fiscal issues.In a rebuke to the president on Sunday, Mr. Ryan said that if Hillary Rodham Clinton had beaten Mr. Obama in the Democratic primaries in 2008 and had gone on to win the presidency, “we would have fixed this fiscal mess by now.”“I don’t think that the president thinks that we actually have a fiscal crisis,” he said. “He’s been reportedly saying to our leaders that we don’t have a spending problem, we have a health care problem. That just leads me to conclude that he actually thinks we just need more government-run health care.”But Mr. Ryan acknowledged that the Republican Party needed to reach out to more Americans, and he signaled a willingness to compromise on some issues.“We obviously have to expand our appeal,” he said. “We have to show how our ideas are better at fighting poverty, how our ideas are better at solving health care, how our ideas are better at solving the problems that arise in people’s daily lives.”On immigration, he said he was hopeful that legislation could be passed this year, if Mr. Obama did not “play politics.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/dance/a-rite-riffs-on-stravinsky-at-chapel-hill-nc.html,"CHAPEL HILL, N.C. — A hundred years on “The Rite of Spring” has become a popular commodity: not just Stravinsky’s score but the whole idea of its neobarbaric modernism and the myths surrounding its scandalous premiere. Like most dance critics, I’m all too used to seeing stagings of “The Rite” that trivialize its complexity: they coast on its music’s force without investigating its ingredients.The ready accessibility of such a famously difficult work — the way its shock has become chic — is part of the subject of “A Rite,” a remarkable, often irritating and sometimes haunting new theater piece by the theater director Anne Bogart, the choreographer Bill T. Jones, and Janet Wong, the associate artistic director of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company. A hybrid, with actors and dancers, it recalls the Tanztheater of Pina Bausch in the way its performers talk as much as they move and make their individual personalities highly theatrical (and these also sing). Really, though, the way it deconstructs “The Rite” recalls enthralling pieces like David Gordon’s “Dancing Henry Five” (2004, about Shakespeare’s “Henry V”) and Katie Mitchell’s “Waves” (2006, about Virginia Woolf’s novel “The Waves”).Carolina Performing Arts presented the work at the end of last week at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, as part of a yearlong series presenting multiple versions of “The Rite” and new works based on it. I saw a sparsely attended preview on Friday, when the official world premiere would have taken place had not bad weather, with frozen rain and black ice on the roads, stepped in. Though modifications may continue (the production reaches New York this year), no structural changes were made for Saturday’s successfully attended performance. In any event, Friday’s showing ran without a hitch.Its flaws, if you regard them as such, are obvious — some of them are certainly deliberate — and yet they prove only incidentally irksome. The greatest virtue of the piece, however, is simply that it honors Stravinsky’s music; I left the theater hungry to hear the full score again. (Heaven knows this is not the effect of most “Rite” stagings.)The music is played in both a modern recording and a crackling old one. The performers sing parts of it — a marvelous effect. You also hear the score twisted into popular music — not coarsely turned into the dance music of the 21st century but subtly tipped over into jazz, accompanied by the Charleston and the Lindy (suggesting that Stravinsky’s deliberate primitivism actually contained the seeds of the coming Jazz Age).You’re lectured by a bespectacled scholar (played by Ellen Lauren) about different aspects of the work (a device intentionally absurd, always bizarre, sometimes annoying, occasionally enlightening). In the worst scenes a soldier (Will Bond) lives out his World War I shell shock, implying both that “The Rite” anticipated mortar bombs and machine-gun fire and that its original audience’s reaction was like that of men in the trenches. Both Ms. Lauren and Mr. Bond, members of Ms. Bogart’s SITI Company, lay their impersonations on thick, but, whereas Ms. Lauren’s musicologist, with her twanging tones, becomes multidimensional and leads us into the music (she grows endearingly awe-struck by its genius), Mr. Bond’s distressed Army character, with his meandering anguish, is primarily an exercise in overwrought acting.Nijinsky’s 1913 choreography is very much part of the mix. The production starts with a group (in modern street clothes but barefoot) reiterating, both at different times and simultaneously, famous images from the Chosen Maiden’s final solo of immolation: the trembling knees, the fist pounded on the floor, the anguished hand on the forehead, the deranged tilts of head and torso, the manual clutching of a single thigh. What once was unique is now widely reproduced: “A Rite” makes this central point about “The Rite” straightaway.The overlaps between acting and dancing are pronounced. Even when you work out which performers come from the Jones/Zane dance company and which come from the SITI Company — not hard in some cases, trickier in others — you’re continually struck by how prepared the actors are to move in the same rhythms and shapes as the dancers and how readily the dancers are to speak (in a range of accents). The voices, amplified, project from speakers high above the stage, adding an ingredient of detachment.The dancing, never virtuoso, is largely for groups small or large; individuals are often lifted in various ways. Though the dances have a general theatrical effectiveness — they’re readily watchable — it’s hard to see what any of them, beyond that mass-Nijinsky opening, mean to achieve. While the talking sections keep exploding “The Rite” into multiple yet specific directions — some speakers tell us tendentiously of its connections to modern science, for example — the dances are far vaguer. They conjure a modern social world, mixed in race and moving in the democratic idioms of dance postmodernism. They hold the eye, but they deepen the work’s expression only in one important way: they show us social orders coming apart and being replaced by new ones.It’s much easier to speak of the acting. Ms. Lauren becomes more pivotal as the work proceeds. Peering at us through her spectacles with head tilted, she rabbits on maddeningly in one spiel after another; she cackles, she drops names (Coco Chanel, Diaghilev) in her often incoherent talk and makes pronouncements about the music as if we all knew who “the Augurs” (characters in the original ballet) were.But then we hear the music, and her batty talk becomes touching: she, the others and we all become caught up in these astounding chords, rhythms and structures. And when the performers all turn parts of the music into wordless sung chorales, we feel how much Stravinsky’s “Rite” has entered into our nervous systems. Although much about “A Rite” is eminently resistible, it is a serious, intricate, multidirectional centennial tribute to a work of art whose spell it deepens."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/global/myanmar-signs-deal-with-world-bank-over-debt.html,"YANGON, Myanmar (AP) — The World Bank on Sunday announced a long-awaited deal to allow Myanmar to clear part of its huge decades-old foreign debt, opening the door for lending to jump-start its lagging economy.The bank’s Washington headquarters said in a statement that the Japan Bank for International Cooperation, the country’s overseas development bank, will provide a bridge loan to Myanmar to allow it to cover outstanding debt to the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which totals about $900 million.Myanmar stopped payments on its old loans in about 1987, making it ineligible for new development lending.The deal is a major breakthrough for Myanmar, with loans likely to go to upgrading its dilapidated infrastructure, including electricity and ports. A result could be to bring in more foreign direct investment, already attracted by the country’s relatively low-cost economy.The deal is also likely to draw criticism, because it comes as Myanmar’s army is pushing hard against ethnic Kachin rebels in the country’s north, echoing the counterinsurgency campaigns of previous military governments.A former general, Thein Sein, became the country’s elected president in 2011 and began reversing almost five decades of military repression by instituting political and economic reforms.He won the substantial easing of economic and political sanctions imposed against the junta by the United States and other nations. But some democracy activists say the rewards have been too much, too fast, allowing some abuses to continue, like repression of ethnic minorities.Myanmar ran up $8.4 billion of debt during the socialist government of Gen. Ne Win from 1962 to 1988, and $2.61 billion of debt after a new military junta took over in 1988, making for a total of a little more than $11 billion.The largest creditor before 1988 was Japan, with loans of $6.39 billion, and the biggest post-1988 creditor was China, with $2.13 billion."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/world/europe/italys-new-tool-for-tax-cheats-the-redditometro.html,"ROME — Despite the government’s best efforts, tax evasion remains something of a pastime in Italy, where, famously, more than a few of the Ferrari-driving set claim impoverishment when it comes to declaring their incomes.So this month, not without controversy, the National Revenue Agency decided to try a new tack. Rather than attempting to ferret out how much suspected tax cheats earn, the agency began trying to infer it from how much they spend.The new tool, known as the “redditometro,” or income measurer, aims to minimize the wiggle room for evasion by examining a taxpayer’s expenditures in dozens of categories, like household costs, car ownership, vacations, gym subscriptions, cellphone usage and clothing. If the taxpayer’s spending appears to be more than 20 percent greater than the income he or she has declared, the agency will ask for an explanation.In a country that is desperate for revenue to straighten out its ailing public finances — and where newspapers routinely publish articles about Lamborghini-loving proletarians — one might expect the redditometro to attract some support, at least among Italians who file truthful tax returns. Yet the redditometro has run into strong opposition, not least from the nation’s suffering retailers, who are worried that it will discourage consumer spending and sink their businesses further. Others have criticized it on civil rights grounds, saying it is overly intrusive.However it is received, the measure reflects the government’s widening effort to persuade more Italians — some say, to bully them — to comply with the tax code.“This tool is part of a broader strategy of tension, which is the real objective,” said Andrea Carinci, a professor of tax law at the University of Bologna. “Not to create panic, but to make taxpayers understand that they have to be virtuous, because there is no escaping. The revenue agency wants to give a message to frighten people.”The message is being received.Serena Sileoni, a legal expert with the Bruno Leoni Institute, an Italian research organization, said in an interview on Radio 24 that forcing taxpayers to keep receipts to document their spending amounted to “an act of psychological terrorism.”Even before the redditometro was introduced, the Italian tax authorities had been steadily adopting tougher measures that have begun to bite. The financial police said last week that in 2012, they uncovered more than 8,600 full-blown tax evaders — individuals who were not in their files at all — with more than $30 billion in undeclared income. Another $23 billion in income that should have been declared on Italian tax returns was unearthed abroad, they said.Even so, those figures represent a relatively small part of Italy’s tax collection shortfall. The national statistics agency estimates that as much as 18 percent of Italy’s gross domestic product comes from the underground economy; if taxes were paid on all of that money, the state would take in as much as $162 billion more each year.When the redditometro was first presented in November, the tax authorities said that by their analyses, about one-fifth of all Italian households exhibited “contradictory results” in their returns. Such contradictions do not necessarily imply tax evasion, officials hastened to add, but they would be enough to warrant closer scrutiny in some cases.The redditometro cross-checks spending against the type of household — say, young single adults, families with children, or retirees — as well as where the taxpayer lives. It also considers national averages for various kinds of spending, calculated by the national statistical agency, Istat.Critics decry what they say is a presumption of guilt, and say the hunt for tax evaders is having a chilling effect on parts of the economy.Sales of domestic sports cars and luxury autos plummeted last year, in part because of higher taxes and tighter tax scrutiny, industry experts say. Other big-ticket luxury goods are also suffering. “People feel under such scrutiny, they’re afraid — and that stops them from purchasing items that are seen as luxury goods,” said Raffaella Cortese, the owner of a gallery in Milan that specializes in contemporary art. “It’s paralyzing for our field.”Even the Italian association of veterinarians raised an alarm last week, saying that one pet owner refused to have an identifying microchip placed in his dog because he did not want to turn up on the radar of the redditometro, which monitors pets as one sign of wealth.Others object to the way the new focus on spending is being applied retroactively — officials are starting with income tax returns filed in 2010 — and have even questioned the redditometro’s constitutionality.Ms. Sileoni, of the Bruno Leoni Institute, said the new approach would probably prompt a flood of lawsuits from taxpayers — cases that, statistics show, the agency often loses, she said. A consumer advocacy group said this month that it would challenge the redditometro in court.Others say that using national averages will unfairly ensnare honest Italians whose spending habits happen to be outside the norm.“If this instrument is used in a bureaucratic and automatic way across the board,” it could be “very dangerous,” said Enrico Zanetti, a tax expert and fiscal consultant for Italia Futura, a centrist political party. No matter what the statistics say, not everyone eats meat, has a dog or goes to the hairdresser each week, he said.With an election campaign looming this year and populism in the air, candidates have begun distancing themselves from the genesis of the tax tool. But there is plenty of credit — or blame — to go around.The redditometro was originally proposed in 2010 by the conservative government of Silvio Berlusconi, and approved by its successor, the nonpartisan government led by Mario Monti. Both men are in the running for prime minister this year.Mr. Monti, who now leads a coalition of small centrist parties, described the redditometro as a “time bomb placed on the road” by his predecessor. For his part, Mr. Berlusconi has argued that the Monti government transformed it “into an instrument that frightens citizens.”The tax authorities are trying to quell some of those concerns, insisting that the redditometro will be used only on the most egregious tax evaders — “fake poor people” who brazenly lie about their incomes, as Marco Di Capua, the deputy director of the national revenue agency, has called them.“It is not an instrument of mass verification,” he said."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/eric-cantor-the-gop-majority-leader-looks-beyond-debt.html,"WASHINGTON — With House Republicans gathered behind closed doors this month at a resort in Williamsburg, Va., Representative Eric Cantor hushed the crowd with a long slide presentation on the prospects of a government default.The federal debt was climbing quickly. The Treasury Department was using “extraordinary measures” to keep paying the nation’s debts, even if, technically, the government had blown past its borrowing limit. President Obama, he said, would set the day the government would go into default, and Republicans balking at raising the debt limit had no real idea when that day would be. The Republican Party was not in control of the situation.For Mr. Cantor, the majority leader, the goals during the ensuing week — from Williamsburg to the House vote last Wednesday to suspend the debt limit until May — were to make sure the government did not default on its debt in the coming weeks and to get House Republicans beyond an endless, and politically fruitless, discussion about debt, deficits and green-eyeshaded austerity.“We are in a town run by Democrats, and we cannot win the hearts and minds of Americans if we are just talking about numbers, day in and day out,” said a Cantor aide, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss his boss’s plans. “There are a lot of things Republicans care about.”After lying low for several months, Mr. Cantor is reasserting his presence in the Capitol, even as Speaker John A. Boehner continues his struggles to maintain Republican unity. In the coming weeks, the majority leader plans to lay out a second, softer track for his party beyond the constant cycle of budget showdowns and deficit talks.Notably, that track will include a new push for private-school vouchers for underprivileged children, health care options beyond the old fight over the president’s health care law, new work force training initiatives and a renewed push for science, technology and engineering visas for would-be immigrants.After successfully engineering the latest debt ceiling vote last week, Mr. Cantor flew to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he road-tested those themes as the lone House Republican leader rubbing elbows with the international elite.Citing a struggling single mother with a gifted child in a poor city neighborhood, he told Davos attendees, “We need to create some type of competitive mechanisms” to help her escape the bad schools she is stuck with. Between meetings with King Abdullah II of Jordan; President Shimon Peres of Israel; the International Monetary Fund director, Christine Lagarde; and Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations, he spoke of “sane immigration policies,” unemployed youths and a German model for economic output.Mr. Cantor is expected to lay out his domestic vision on Feb. 5 at the American Enterprise Institute, a center-right research group.His latest moves follow two episodes this month that attracted wide notice and new questions about Republican unity. He publicly broke with the speaker early this month over the deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, voting against the agreement even as Mr. Boehner voted for it. He then deftly maneuvered to secure passage of a Hurricane Sandy disaster relief package that Mr. Boehner had initially been cool to, bowing to pressure from financial donors in New York and engineering a complex process that satisfied both Northeastern Republicans and fiscal conservatives.On the train ride to the House Republican retreat in Williamsburg, Mr. Cantor, who represents a district in Virginia, walked the aisles and worked the back bench, asking members about their legislative interests and promising attention.Mr. Cantor’s actions lack what many saw in 2011, the first year of Republican House control, as overt disloyalty to Mr. Boehner. Instead, lawmakers and aides say, his eye may be on an emerging potential rival for the speakership, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the party’s 2012 vice-presidential nominee.Mr. Ryan has given no sign that he wants the job, but House Republicans say that if anyone can challenge Mr. Cantor for the job, it is Mr. Ryan, the House Budget Committee chairman. Mr. Cantor appears to be shoring up his power before Mr. Boehner’s retirement, which many believe will come in four years, if not two.“I have never felt that there was any real reason to believe Eric is plotting and scheming against the speaker,” said Vin Weber, a former Republican House member who remains close to the leadership. “But when you’re in the leadership, you’re always looking over your shoulder, using your peripheral vision to see who might be coming up on you. That’s the nature of leadership.”Mr. Cantor’s supporters say his moves have nothing to do with leadership intrigue and everything to do with leadership — and with shaping the direction of the party after last year’s electoral defeats.After more than two years of budget fights, the majority leader, more than anyone else in the leadership, is said to want to broaden the discussion. His mantra behind closed doors is “How do we make life work better?” aides say, and he would like the next two years to be at least as much about job creation and economic opportunity as about spending cuts and changes to entitlement programs.Mr. Cantor’s votes — against the fiscal cliff deal but for $60 billion in disaster aid — may have lacked ideological consistency, but they do contain a common thread. All have been good for Mr. Cantor.The work he did for the aid package put him in a small minority of his party. The bill passed 241 to 180, but only 49 Republicans voted yes; 179, including Mr. Ryan, voted no. But its passage pleased rich New York donors like the venture capitalist Kenneth G. Langone and the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, Lloyd C. Blankfein, who pushed him hard for a vote after the speaker backed off the bill on the last day of the 112th Congress.Those donors, in turn, help keep Mr. Cantor’s two political action committees, the YG Action Fund and the Every Republican Is Crucial PAC, flush so he can spread largess to the young House Republicans who make up the core of his support. Goldman Sachs was the second-largest donor to ERIC PAC in the 2012 political cycle.“I certainly asked a good number of people in New York who he has relationships with to call him and ask for his support,” said Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York.Mr. Cantor stayed on the right side of House conservatives — and against Mr. Boehner and Mr. Ryan — when he shocked Republicans and opposed the last-minute deal that allowed taxes to rise on incomes over $400,000 while averting much broader tax increases that could have put the economy back into recession.The deal passed 257 to 167, but this time Mr. Cantor was with the majority of his conference. Just 85 Republicans voted for it, including Mr. Boehner, who rarely votes; 151 voted against.“This is all about the longer term,” one House Republican said. “Get rid of the image of being too grasping and ambitious. Cooperate with Boehner where it’s not going to hurt him, but don’t run risks in the short term.”Mr. Cantor is in a tricky position. If he becomes too closely associated with Mr. Boehner, he could be swept aside in the event of a broad leadership upheaval. But he cannot look like the architect of upheaval and risk losing the gavel in the melee.Mr. Cantor declined to be interviewed for this article. But Doug Heye, a Cantor spokesman, dismissed any talk of disunity. The top leaders are working well together, he said, but sometimes their beliefs will diverge.“When it comes to the cliff, when it comes to Sandy, he voted his conscience and what he thought was right,” Mr. Heye said of his boss.But even the hint of division is coming at a bad time, with Mr. Obama fresh off a convincing electoral victory and staking out uncompromising positions as the government careers toward the next fiscal deadlines: March 1, when nearly $1 trillion in across-the-board defense and domestic spending cuts begin; March 27, when the stopgap law financing the government expires; and May 16, when the new debt ceiling reprieve expires.“This is an unprecedented time for House Republican leadership,” said Ron Bonjean, who was an aide to J. Dennis Hastert of Illinois, a former Republican speaker. “Never before have we lacked a consistent message due to the results of an election, with such high stakes ahead.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/global/us-reassures-an-impatient-europe-on-trade.html,"DAVOS, Switzerland — President Barack Obama is committed to reaching an agreement to smooth trade with the European Union, the United States’ top negotiator has said, but only if it is constructed in a way that would overcome objections from farm groups and that could win congressional approval.In an interview Saturday in Davos, Ron Kirk, the U.S. trade representative, responded to European leaders who in the past week renewed their calls for a U.S.-Europe deal to dismantle tariffs and other barriers, which they badly want as a way of stimulating their ailing economies.At the World Economic Forum, David Cameron, the British prime minister, and Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, were among a host of leaders and business people pleading for a pact that would eliminate tariffs as well as regulations that impede trade. Even without changes, the United States and Europe between them already have the world’s largest trading market.On both sides of the Atlantic, proponents of a deal have expressed frustration about the delaying of an official report by a U.S.-European working group that would set the stage for formal talks. The delay has fed the widespread perception that Mr. Obama does not care that much about a trade pact or, for that matter, about Europe in general.“We greatly value the trans-Atlantic relationship,” Mr. Kirk said at a hotel in Davos. “We have devoted an extraordinary amount of time” to a possible trade agreement, he said. But the administration wants to make sure objections from farmers and other constituencies are addressed first, he said. Otherwise, officials might spend years negotiating an agreement only for Congress to reject it.“If we do this, we want there to be a bridge to somewhere and we want to get there on one tank of gas,” Mr. Kirk said. He declined to predict when formal talks might begin.Trade had been one of the main topics of discussion at the World Economic Forum, which concluded Saturday. There were signs of progress toward a trade accord, which, if it proved durable, could provide a riposte to the eternal criticism of the elite event: that the annual Davos forum is just an expensive cocktail party where little of substance is ever accomplished.While it is true that Davos is rarely the venue for concrete agreements, the event attracts a diverse international crowd in an informal setting. It can be a place where political and business leaders work toward consensus on difficult issues like trade. That may have been the case in the past week, some of the people involved said.“I’m carefully optimistic we will kick off negotiations this year,” Alexander Stubb, the Finnish minister for foreign affairs and trade, said after a panel on trade issues at the forum Saturday. “It’s going in the right direction.”Noting that trade ministers from more than 20 nations were in town, Mr. Kirk said: “It’s a great opportunity to touch base with a number of them bilaterally. This saves me a trip to nine other countries.”“Everybody criticizes Davos until they come,” Mr. Kirk said.Friction-free commerce between the United States and Europe could create jobs and add an estimated $50 billion a year to the U.S. economy, Mr. Kirk said. European political leaders fervently want a deal to help their anemic economies grow. There is also strong support from business groups on both sides of the Atlantic.“Half a dozen senior leaders in Europe are ready to move forward,” Thomas J. Donohue, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said in an interview in Davos on Thursday. He said that a deal could be concluded within 18 months if both sides set their minds to it.But others are skeptical, noting that Europe and the United States have been talking on and off about a trade deal for years. While U.S. companies like General Electric have expressed strong support for an agreement, progress has always been stymied by objections from interest groups, particularly over agricultural issues. Some Europeans, for example, object to imports of U.S. food containing genetically modified plants.“I was surprised to hear all the speakers saying it will happen in the next two years,” said Maximilian Zimmerer, chief financial officer of Allianz, a German insurance company. “What about the last 10 years?”Mr. Kirk declined to go into detail about what specific issues might be delaying a report by what is known as a High Level Working Group, which he leads along with Karel De Gucht, the E.U. trade commissioner. A favorable recommendation by the group would set in motion the process of negotiating a comprehensive agreement.But Mr. Kirk noted that members of Congress with farmers as constituents far outnumbered those whose districts included big companies like Boeing or Apple that would benefit from a trade deal. “Agriculture tends to be a challenging issue,” he said.That is partly because American farmers are already on the lighter side of the trade scale. The European Union exports far more farm products to the United States than vice versa: 14.6 billion euros, or $19.7 billion, versus 8.2 billion euros, according to E.U. figures for 2011, the most recent available.Mr. Kirk has announced plans to leave his post as trade representative next month, and Mr. Obama has not named his successor. But Mr. Kirk said that his departure would not impede progress toward a deal.Mr. Kirk and others say the biggest benefits of a trade pact would come from eliminating regulatory barriers. For example, while both the United States and Europe have strict requirements on auto safety and emissions, the rules are different.Harmonizing the regulations would free carmakers like Audi from having to make costly changes in headlights, exhaust systems and other components in order to export them to the United States.Synchronizing regulations is much more complicated than eliminating tariffs. But, Mr. Kirk said, “These are all problems that are solvable.”Some trade experts argue that even bigger benefits could come simply from streamlining official procedures involved when goods move across borders. The longer a product sits on a dock waiting for customs clearance, the greater the cost to companies and consumers.A study by the World Bank and the consulting firm Bain & Co., published at the World Economic Forum last week, estimated that trade could increase by 15 percent if goods moved across borders more efficiently. Such changes also raise fewer political issues.“We’re talking about removing waste,” Mark Gottfredson, a partner at Bain, said in Davos. “Everybody can agree on that.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/obama-seeks-to-keep-status-quo-despite-talk-of-move-to-left.html,"WASHINGTON — For all the talk that President Obama has shifted leftward, much of his early second-term energy seeks simply to preserve the status quo.Mr. Obama’s Inaugural Address last week celebrated the role of “collective action” in creating conditions for a modern economy, expanding individual opportunity and assisting the poor. He rejected Republican arguments that government benefits create “a nation of takers.”That partisan gibe was telling. He defended two programs, Medicare and Medicaid, begun nearly a half-century ago, and a third, Social Security, that dates from the Great Depression. The federal welfare commitments that Mr. Obama praised in observing that “a great nation must care for the vulnerable” also date back to President Franklin D. Roosevelt’s time.Yet all those benefits are in the cross-fire of the president’s continuing fiscal battle with Republicans in Congress. That is not because of a shift in philosophy by Mr. Obama or his party, but rather because of the looming cost of the retirements of baby boomers and of the persistent ideological boldness of partisan foes.Mr. Obama expanded the scope of federal obligations during his first term through short-term stimulus programs and the new health care law. Encouraged by his second popular-vote majority in November and hardened by his confrontations with Republicans over the past two years, he has taken a feistier stance toward his adversaries.None of the president’s economic initiatives, however, represent a departure for Mr. Obama himself, or for his party. If President Bill Clinton set out to build a “bridge to the 21st century,” said Simon Rosenberg, the president and founder of the New Democrat Network, Mr. Obama is walking across it.John D. Podesta, an Obama adviser who served as chief of staff in the Clinton White House, called the president’s second-term economic agenda “consistent with where he’s been, consistent with where Clinton was.”Indeed, since World War II both parties have accepted a substantial measure of federal activism “as American as apple pie,” said Kenneth Baer, a former Obama budget aide.Mr. Obama’s problem is that postwar America could afford more pie than a post-baby-boomer America will be able to. And in the era of the Tea Party, Republicans have proved increasingly willing to challenge once-settled assumptions about Washington’s role.In another political moment, Mr. Obama’s attempt to preserve old governing assumptions might be labeled conservative. But Republicans, even after shifting tactics in the wake of a bracing November defeat, say he will have to fight nonstop to advance his agenda.“His entire second term on fiscal issues is going to be essentially defensive,” said Representative Tom Cole, a veteran Republican from Oklahoma. “He’s trying to defend not just the New Deal legacy, but also Obamacare.”Mr. Cole added, “The problem he has is, those programs can’t be defended in their current forms.”But Republicans also have not made their case for the “structural reforms” that they say have been made urgent by trillion-dollar deficits. In fact, they have failed to do so repeatedly.In the 1990s, Speaker Newt Gingrich’s attempt to rein in Medicare and Medicaid spending helped Mr. Clinton win a second term. President George W. Bush, after adding a prescription drug benefit to Medicare in 2003, could not persuade a Republican Congress to pass his plan for a partial privatization of Social Security.In last year’s campaign, the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney, and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, backed a plan to overhaul Medicare through spending limits on each beneficiary. But their plan pushed such savings 10 years into the future, while they attacked Mr. Obama for having cut Medicare spending to help finance the health care law.When it comes to Republicans pushing for structural changes in benefit programs, “the record there is not good,” said Peter Wehner, a former Bush White House aide. And the Republican argument will not soon get easier to make.Mr. Obama acknowledges the need for some cuts in entitlement spending, but he campaigned successfully on higher taxes for affluent Americans as an alternative to the deep cuts that Republicans want. By refusing to negotiate this month over raising the nation’s borrowing limit, Mr. Obama forced Republican leaders to set that cudgel aside without accepting the spending cuts they previously insisted on.To swing rank-and-file Republicans behind that capitulation, House leaders promised that Mr. Ryan’s new budget plan this spring would eliminate the budget deficit within 10 years. Doing so, however, will almost certainly require limiting Medicare spending much sooner than 10 years from now — a step that Mr. Wehner said “I’m not sure I’d recommend,” because it could bring more political pain.Yet fiscal pressure on the White House will not let up even if Mr. Obama marshals public opinion against that budget. Absent a negotiated deal to reduce spending, Mr. Cole said, Republicans say they will let $1 trillion in 10-year across-the-board budget cuts take effect under the “sequestration” provision both parties agreed to in 2011. That would squeeze defense and domestic government functions alike.A deal remains possible. In earlier, unsuccessful talks with Republicans, Mr. Obama embraced what Mr. Podesta calls “sensible reforms” to major entitlement programs, including reduced spending for affluent beneficiaries and more modest inflation adjustments.Not even liberal advocates hold out much hope for new expansions in the government’s economic role, or crackdowns on the United States’ trading partners, or stimulus spending to reduce unemployment — notwithstanding Mr. Obama’s second-inaugural swagger.Upon hearing Mr. Obama’s address, “I was troubled by the assumption that the economy’s in recovery, when for most Americans the recovery hasn’t started,” said Robert L. Borosage, a co-director of the liberal Campaign for America’s Future.“He spoke to the progressive coalition,” Mr. Borosage added. But in some ways, he said, the speech “sounded like it came from the Clinton years.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/an-italian-bank-caught-in-the-vortex-of-election-politics.html,"MILAN — The chief executive of a regional Italian bank embroiled in a scandal with political and even Europe-wide implications said Monday that recent revelations of past mismanagement and questionable deals would not impede efforts to turn around the beleaguered institution.“This is still a solid bank,” Fabrizio Viola, chief executive of Monte dei Paschi di Siena, said Monday at a news conference in Milan.In the past week revelations of transactions that may have disguised the extent of the bank’s losses during the global financial crisis have become political fodder ahead of Italy’s national elections next month.And the disclosures have raised questions about the degree of scrutiny given Monte dei Paschi di Siena by Mario Draghi, who was still head of Italy’s central bank when the problems developed. Mr. Draghi, of course, is now president of the European Central Bank.At issue is whether Monte dei Paschi di Siena, or M.P.S. as it is known, hid losses it incurred after acquiring the Italian bank Antonveneta in 2008, for €9 billion — a price that even at the time was widely derided as far too high. Now under scrutiny are two complex transactions M.P.S. conducted with Deutsche Bank and Nomura that critics say enabled M.P.S. to mask some of its losses.Mr. Viola, part of the new management that came to the bank last year, said Monday that an investigation now under way would produce findings by mid-February, ahead of national elections scheduled for Feb. 24 and 25.With M.P.S. based in Siena, in a part of northern Italy that is a stronghold of the leftist Democratic Party, the conservative former prime minister Silvio Berlusconi, who is trying to be a spoiler in next month’s elections, has been trying to lay blame for the scandal at the Democratic Party’s doorstep. Meanwhile, the current prime minister, Mario Monti, has had to defend his government’s decision to bail out the banks with loans granted last year.More broadly, though, the problems at M.P.S. provide an extreme example of an old-line banking pattern that analysts say is still disturbingly commonplace in Europe. As with most Italian banks, M.P.S.’s primary shareholder is a local foundation, which receives dividends that are to be used to pay for social projects as well as cultural and charitable enterprises. That gives M.P.S. an extensive veil of political relationships that can be hard for any national overseer to peer through.The same combination of local political influence and lax control has also afflicted many banks in Germany and Spain, with taxpayers left suffering the consequences. Indeed, grave lapses by national regulators are among the main reasons European leaders have decided to put the European Central Bank in charge of bank regulation.But now there is a possible snag in the plan: Mr. Draghi, who is expected to lead that overhaul, was at least nominally the overseer of M.P.S. while it was digging itself into a deep hole.Many analysts, though, question whether Mr. Draghi — or any Italian regulators — would have had enough information to recognize the bank’s problems, since there appears to have been a deliberate attempt to conceal losses. And in any case, the Bank of Italy may not have had legal power to prevent M.P.S. from making bad decisions.But at the very least Mr. Draghi’s proximity to the scandal is untimely as the E.C.B. and euro zone leaders finally seemed to be rebuilding credibility in the common currency. The decision to create a centralized banking supervisor at the E.C.B. is a big part of the effort to restore confidence in the euro zone.“Italy is a country where even national regulators can have a trouble getting a grip on what is happening at the local level,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. Mr. Véron stressed that there was no evidence Mr. Draghi deserved any blame for the Monti dei Paschi scandal.But Mr. Véron said, “It clearly does create perception problems, because there’s a question mark about the appropriateness of the Bank of Italy’s response at the time.”“At this point it’s only a question mark,” Mr. Véron said. “We don’t have any facts.”A spokesman for the E.C.B. declined to comment Monday.Several of Germany’s landesbanks, regional institutions typically owned jointly by state governments and local savings banks, have also gotten into serious trouble in recent years and required bailouts which cost taxpayers billions of euros. Like M.P.S., many landesbanks got in over their heads when they tried to respond to the increasing dominance of big investment banks by getting into investment banking themselves.M.P.S.’s problems stem partly from its attempts, starting in the 1990s, to avoid being acquired by larger rivals, said Filippo Ippolito, an assistant professor in finance at Pompeu Fabra University in Barcelona. Mr. Ippolito is from Siena and worked for several years at Monti dei Paschi more than a decade ago.The city foundation that owned a majority of the bank wanted to keep its headquarters in Siena. But attempts by bank management to join the major leagues turned out badly, including an abortive attempt to get into investment banking and, in 2007, the ill-fated €9 billion acquisition of Antonveneta.In retrospect, Mr. Ippolito said, Siena would be much better off if it had allowed M.P.S. to be acquired years ago.“The great fear of the Sienese in the 90s was in losing control of the bank,” Mr. Ippolito said. “Now they are losing control anyway and it’s not worth anything. The worst outcome is coming true.”The scandal may also have implications for two of the largest banks operating in Europe. Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt and Nomura, a Japanese bank which has a large presence in London, were involved in transactions that may have allowed Monti dei Paschi to conceal losses.A spokesman for Nomura said the bank would not comment. Deutsche Bank issued a statement Monday saying said the financing transaction with Monti dei Paschi in 2008 “was subject to our rigorous internal approval processes and also received the requisite approvals of the client who was independently advised.”“There will be polemics and rhetoric about evil foreign bankers,” said Federico Fubini, an economics reporter at the Milan daily Corriere della Sera. “But upon closer look, the M.P.S. affair reflects the Italian way of doing things, one that has contributed to the current crisis of competitiveness.”Bank board members appointed by foundations have more political than financial competence, said Tito Boeri, who teaches economics at Bocconi University in Milan, which can lead to bad judgment, like the “crazy idea to buy Antonveneta to maximize power,” he said.Italian newspapers on Monday said that investigators were looking into the possibility that a bribe had been paid as part of the acquisition of Antonveneta, which was bought from the Spanish bank Santander. But Mr. Viola, the M.P.S. chief executive, said Monday that no evidence had emerged that illicit money had passed hands. Should any evidence emerge, he said, the bank would present itself as an injured party in court.Though Mr. Berlusconi, of the People of Liberty Party, and Mr. Monti, who leads a centrist coalition, have not failed to underscore the links between M.P.S. and the Democratic Party, political analysts say it is unlikely that the revelations will have much effect on national elections next month. Opinion polls in the past week tend to support that view.But the murkiness may have thwarted the Democratic Party’s ability to lure fresh voters, said Stefano Folli, a political analyst for economic daily Il Sole 24 Ore, limiting their overall numbers and making it more difficult for the party to control both houses of Parliament.“Right now the Democratic Party hovers between 29 and 32 percent, after Monte dei Paschi, I doubt it will go any higher,” but it will not go any lower either, he said, as long as “no further scandals emerge.” Current polls show that because of the way the Italian parliamentary seats are allotted, the center-left will win the lower house but may not have control of the senate.Mr. Viola said Monday that the political brouhaha over the bank was distorting the issue at stake, “out of line with respect to the problem.Speaking on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum in Davos last week, the current Bank of Italy governor, Ignazio Visco, said: “M.P.S. is a sound bank. The Bank of Italy does not act as a police force, but promotes sound and prudent management.”Others say that any responsibility, or blame for lapses, should be shared by the Finance Ministry, which oversees banking foundations.New revelations are expected to emerge Tuesday when Italy’s financial stability committee — which includes representatives of the Finance Ministry, the Bank of Italy and other regulars — will meet in Rome to discuss the M.P.S. affair.Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/nyregion/congress-gives-final-approval-to-hurricane-sandy-aid.html,"WASHINGTON — Congress gave final approval on Monday to an emergency aid package of nearly $51 billion to help millions of victims of Hurricane Sandy, ending the legislation’s long and complicated odyssey.By a 62-to-36 vote, the Senate approved the measure, with 9 Republicans joining 53 Democrats to support it. The House recently passed the bill, 241 to 180, after initially refusing to act on it amid objections from fiscal conservatives over its size and its impact on the federal deficit.The newly adopted aid package comes on top of nearly $10 billion that Congress approved this month to support the recovery efforts in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and other states that were battered by the hurricane in late October.The money will provide aid to people whose homes were damaged or destroyed, as well as to business owners who had heavy losses. It will also pay for replenishing shorelines, repairing subway and commuter rail systems, fixing bridges and tunnels, and reimbursing local governments for emergency spending.President Obama praised the vote, saying, “I commend Congress for giving families and businesses the help they deserve, and I will sign this bill into law as soon as it hits my desk.”Leaders from storm-damaged states welcomed the vote in the Senate, though the aid package does not cover the entire $82 billion in damage that the governors of New York, New Jersey and Connecticut identified in aid requests to Washington.Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, a Republican, joined with Govs. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York and Dannel P. Malloy of Connecticut, both Democrats, saying, “Despite the difficult path in getting to this moment, the Senate membership clearly recognized early on the urgency and necessity of approving the full aid package.”“To all Americans,” they added, “we are grateful for their willingness to come to our aid as we take on the monumental task of rebuilding, and we pledge to do the same should our fellow citizens find themselves facing unexpected and harsh devastation.”In the debate leading up to the vote in the Senate, lawmakers from the storm-tossed region faced one major hurdle: an amendment backed by fiscal conservatives that proposed cuts in other programs to pay for the storm aid.Republican supporters of the amendment argued that Congress had to begin imposing fiscal discipline on itself and that the aid package included unrelated spending items, like $274 million for Coast Guard initiatives in the Bahamas and Great Lakes.“At some point, we need to make choices,” Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, told his colleagues. “We can’t have everything. That’s how you get trillion-dollar deficits.”But lawmakers from the region argued that the government had an obligation to respond quickly to the emergency in the Northeast without miring the process in a debate over deficit spending.Supporters of the package also warned that amending the bill would further delay aid from getting to victims by forcing the measure to be considered yet again in the House, where it has already faced fierce resistance.“It’s been 91 days since Sandy struck,” Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said. “We’ve waited 91 long days. We can’t wait any longer.”In the end, the amendment was defeated, 62 to 35, largely along party lines.The Senate action brings an end to a fierce Congressional debate that had lasted since Dec. 7, when Mr. Obama proposed a $60.4 billion emergency bill to finance recovery efforts.The Democratic-led Senate passed the measure, with minor changes, within a few weeks. But the Senate measure eventually died in the House after Speaker John A. Boehner, Republican of Ohio, adjourned the previous Congress without taking it up.Mr. Boehner eventually agreed to take up the matter this year after coming under intense criticism from leading Republicans in and out of Congress, including Governor Christie."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/europe/russia-tries-to-prosecute-the-dead-whistle-blower-magnitsky.html,"MOSCOW — Russia took the unusual step on Monday of attempting to put a dead man on trial, when it tried to open posthumous proceedings against Sergei L. Magnitsky, the whistle-blowing lawyer who died three years ago in a Moscow jail cell.The effort to prosecute Mr. Magnitsky, which was postponed when Mr. Magnitsky’s legal team refused to participate, stoked tensions in a case that has already damaged Russia’s image abroad and strained relations with the United States.Mr. Magnitsky was 37 when he died in a Russian jail, where he had been held for nearly a year. The authorities said he was detained on tax evasion charges and died of a heart attack. His advocates say that he was jailed for investigating hundreds of millions of dollars possibly taken by the authorities in a fraudulent tax case, and that he was beaten and denied medical care.Last month, the United States Congress passed a law barring anyone linked to Mr. Magnitsky’s imprisonment or the initial fraud from entering the United States. In retaliation, Russia’s Parliament in December prohibited Americans from adopting Russian orphans.As expected, the empty-chair prosecution drew an immediate rebuke. Critics said that it was an attempt to intimidate Mr. Magnitsky’s family members, and that it was a clear indication of rising prosecutorial overzealousness under President Vladimir V. Putin.In the past year amid political protests, critics note, Russian courts have tried members of a punk band, Pussy Riot, sending two of its members to prison for an anti-Putin performance in a prominent Moscow cathedral; dozens of street protesters; and the American singer Madonna for a performance in St. Petersburg over the summer that officials said violated a local law against propagandizing homosexual behavior. The case was thrown out.In Monday’s hearing, it was unclear who or what, exactly, went on trial. Mr. Magnitsky’s co-defendant, William F. Browder, the manager of the Hermitage Capital hedge fund, has been barred from entering Russia since 2005, so he did not appear in court.The hearing was of a type in Russian practice that indicates that the police consider their work complete, and that the case can go to trial, Aleksandra V. Bereznina, a spokeswoman for Tverskoi Regional Court, said in an interview.Judge Igor B. Alisov promptly postponed the trial because the defendants did not appear in the courtroom — as expected — but neither did lawyers representing their interests.Posthumous criminal cases are rare in international practice, most often allowed only when relatives want to clear the name of a suspect, and rarely at the behest of the police, criminal law experts say. When a suspect dies, the question of guilt or innocence is usually rendered moot.“All questions about investigating and charging of suspects, whoever it may be, alive or maybe not alive or something else, that is up to the police,” Ms. Bereznina said. “The court just looks at the case and the court just decides, what evidence is there?“It can decide to proceed, to convict or to acquit.”The hearing took place in a closed courtroom. The defendants’ chairs were unoccupied, Ms. Bereznina said. Mr. Browder and relatives of Mr. Magnitsky have said they will boycott the proceedings.As Congress debated its punitive law against Russia, the police in Russia reopened the criminal case against Mr. Magnitsky last February, saying it would provide a chance for relatives and supporters to clear his name, in effect to defend his reputation. Mr. Browder maintains that the case is instead intended to intimidate members of Mr. Magnitsky’s family and discourage them from pressing for prosecutions in his death.Judge Alisov ordered a delay of the start of the trial until Feb. 18 so that the Moscow bar association could appoint public defenders for the dead man and his long-absent co-defendant."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/generous-executive-pay-at-bailed-out-companies-treasury-watchdog-says.html,"WASHINGTON — Top executives at firms that received taxpayer bailouts during the financial crisis continue to receive generous government-approved compensation packages, a Treasury watchdog said in a report released on Monday.The report comes from the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, the bank bailout law passed at the end of the George W. Bush administration. The watchdog, commonly called Sigtarp, found that 68 out of 69 executives at Ally Financial, the American International Group and General Motors received annual compensation of $1 million or more, with the Treasury’s signoff.All but one of the top executives at the failed insurer A.I.G. — which required more than $180 billion in emergency taxpayer financing — received pay packages worth more than $2 million. And 16 top executives at the three firms earned combined pay of more than $100 million.“In 2012, these three TARP companies convinced Treasury to roll back its guidelines by approving multimillion-dollar pay packages, high cash salaries, huge pay raises and removing compensation tied to meeting performance metrics,” Christy Romero, the special inspector general, said in a statement. “Treasury cannot look out for taxpayers’ interests if it continues to rely to a great extent on the pay proposed by companies that have historically pushed back on pay limits.”The report charges that Treasury has failed to rein in excessive pay at the three firms. It found that Treasury approved all pay raises requested for A.I.G., Ally and General Motors executives last year, with individual compensation increases of $30,000 to $1 million. It also faults the Treasury overseer for allowing pay packages above what comparable executives at other firms receive.The report also accuses Treasury of failing to follow up earlier recommendations made by the special inspector general. A report issued a year ago made many similar criticisms, arguing that the Treasury officials “could not effectively rein in excessive compensation” because the most “important goal was to get the companies to repay” the government.“Treasury made no meaningful reform to its processes,” it said in this year’s report. “Lacking criteria and an effective decision-making process, Treasury risks continuing to award executives of bailed-out companies excessive cash compensation without good cause.”In a response letter included in the report, Patricia Geoghegan, acting special master for TARP executive compensation, disputed several of its assertions. For one, the compensation packages for A.I.G. and General Motors executives were comparable to those received by executives at other firms, Treasury said. Pay packages at Ally were higher than the median because of “unique circumstances,” it said.Treasury also noted that the Obama administration had cut pay for executives at bailed-out firms and required that the companies pay top employees with more stock and less cash. Treasury “continues to fulfill its regulatory requirements,” the letter said. It has “limited executive compensation while at the same time keeping compensation at levels that enable the ‘exceptional assistance’ recipients to remain competitive and repay Tarp assistance.”The Treasury is selling off its remaining shares of General Motors. In December, Treasury sold its final shares in A.I.G., bringing its and the Federal Reserve’s total profit on its investment in the company to nearly $23 billion."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/nyregion/homes-in-flood-zone-doubles-in-new-fema-map.html,"New federal flood maps released on Monday revealed the grim news that many New Yorkers were girding for after Hurricane Sandy sloshed away: More areas farther inland are expected to flood. Tidal surges will be more ferocious. And 35,000 more homes and businesses will be located in flood zones, which will almost certainly nudge up insurance rates and determine how some structures are rebuilt.The maps, created by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and based in some areas on 30-year-old data, were already in the process of being updated when the hurricane struck.The agency hurried to release the new maps, which include the worst-hit parts of Staten Island, Queens and Brooklyn. They double the number of structures now in flood zones.The remainder of the maps for the New York City area are expected to be released next month.“This really allows people to prepare better,” said Michael Byrne, the agency’s federal coordinating officer for New York. “To rebuild, and when they’re doing the rebuilding, to be aware of the risk.”The maps will not formally go into effect for about two years, but the mayor’s office was already preparing an executive order to help owners of damaged homes rebuild to higher standards. That means that a badly damaged home that was not in the old flood zone, but is in the new one, would be allowed to rebuild to prepare for dangers predicted in the new maps. For instance, a home could be hoisted onto posts or pilings, which might have previously been disallowed because of zoning. “We’re working on an order that will enable people to rebuild, but rebuild in a way that’s safer,” said Caswell F. Holloway, the city’s deputy mayor for operations.While the new maps will not affect the city’s evacuation zone maps, they are predictors for new flood insurance rate maps, Mr. Holloway said. The city’s building code will eventually take into account the new maps.With the help of these new maps, more parts of coastal New York could resemble coastal parts of Florida and Louisiana, with homes and businesses hoisted on huge posts or stilts (a tactic some New York businesses have already adopted, like the Brooklyn Crab restaurant in Red Hook, and the Ikea nearby).To help offset the costs, Mr. Byrne, of FEMA, said homeowners with federally backed insurance policies could get up to an additional $30,000 for rebuilding their homes to comply with new codes. Mr. Holloway said it was hoped that federal aid in the wake of the storm would include money to help homeowners better protect their homes.According to the agency, owners of a $250,000 home with a ground floor built four feet below sea level could pay up to $9,500 a year for flood insurance, compared with $427 for homes built three feet above the flood line. Mr. Byrne said the maps were based on current conditions. “We’re not taking into consideration any future climate change,” he said.Officials from storm-ravaged areas said the new maps presented already-struggling storm victims with a difficult choice: pay now to rebuild smarter, or pay higher insurance rates later.“There is already so much of a financial burden being placed on those people trying to rebuild their lives,” said Nicole Malliotakis, a state assemblywoman who represents Staten Island’s east coast, which bore some of the worst horrors of the storm. “This adds to the confusion, and it adds to the financial burden. Raise your home to what the FEMA maps tell you you need to, or pay a substantial premium for flood insurance.”Compounding the financial burden for many storm victims, she continued, was the fact that many insurance companies were reluctant to reimburse claims quickly, if at all. “A lot of people are having a very hard time settling claims,” Ms. Malliotakis said.The new maps allow property owners to check their address to determine whether they are in a flood zone, and how severe the flooding could be, though vulnerability varies, depending on factors like the type of construction used or whether a building sits on a slight rise. Far more structures are now in areas where flooding is expected to top three feet, a level that, the agency said, could easily shove a structure off its foundation.“This is going to be very rough on people,” said Chuck Reichenthal, district manager for Brooklyn’s Community Board 13, which includes Coney Island. “Insurance is going to zoom through the roof.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/in-australia-miners-break-new-records.html,"SYDNEY — Despite all the doomsayers predicting an end to the Australian mining boom, the country is continuing to pump out metal, coal and natural gas after an investment bonanza, giving a boost to exports and extending the country’s 21-year run of economic growth.Since the boom began in 2007, mining companies have poured 268 billion Australian dollars, or $282 billion, into new projects. But long construction times mean that actual output has lagged.That is changing as the major miners in Australia are breaking production records, with double-digit growth expected this year.The higher export volumes should help plug any hole left in the Australian economy as the huge investments in mining begin to wind down. The sector accounts for 8 percent of Australia’s 1.5 trillion-dollar economy, four times its long-term average.“The death of the mining boom has been greatly exaggerated, as the pickup in exports illustrates,” said Paul Bloxham, an economist at HSBC in Sydney. “And this is only the beginning of the export story. In the next few years, Australia is set to become a global energy player as LNG comes on stream,” he said, referring to liquefied natural gas.With the Australian economy growing 3.1 percent in the year that ended in September, the country overtook Spain as the world’s 12th-largest economy. But it will need that boost in mining output and exports to come about quickly if it is to avoid a subsequent dip.Given the scale of mining investments, even a modest pullback would hurt growth and could put the country at risk of a recession. Australia is the only developed country that largely dodged recession during the global financial crisis.The need to offset that danger is a major reason investors believe the Reserve Bank of Australia will cut interest rates to a record low this year, after four similar cuts in 2012.Yet recent production reports from Australia’s’s biggest miners do offer hope that exports are ramping up just in time.BHP Billiton , Rio Tinto and Fortescue Metals all dug up record amounts of iron ore in the last quarter as well as for the whole of 2012. Chinese demand has proved strong enough for much of this output, even as prices kept rising.Shipments of iron ore to China from Port Hedland in Australia climbed by a quarter in December from the previous month. Shipments were up more than 21 percent for the year.Production from Australia’s main iron ore region of Pilbara is now predicted to rise about 17 percent in 2013, and all of that increase is expected to go to the export market.The mineral that is essential to steel making already accounts for a fifth of the country’s exports, bringing in over 60 billion dollars a year. A decade ago it was worth just 15 billion dollars.Likewise, coal output is forecast to expand about 10 percent this year, while shipments of oil and liquefied natural gas are starting to increase sharply.This month, Woodside Petroleum announced a 46 percent jump in fourth-quarter production, in large part attributed to the strong performance of its flagship Pluto LNG project.Santos, one of the country’s leading energy firms, reported a 13 percent rise in output, lifting revenue in the quarter to a record $876 million.Australia has high hopes for liquefied natural gas as 190 billion dollars’ worth of projects are under way, with most of the natural gas already sold under long-term contracts. The government’s official forecaster predicts that export volumes of liquefied natural gas will rise 26 percent this year, and will quintuple by 2020, making it as valuable an earner as iron ore is now.“L.N.G. will be the game changer,” said Brian Redican, a senior economist at Macquarie in Sydney. “It will be a truly extraordinary boon and a great tailwind for the economy.”Figures like these have given the Australian treasurer, Wayne Swan, the confidence to scoff at reports of the demise of mining.“We know that the upswing in actual mining production, output and export volumes is still ramping up, and that this will be a driver of Australia’s economic growth in future years,” Mr. Swan told a Harvard Club luncheon in New York this week.An increase in output is long overdue. While earnings from all of Australia’s exports have risen by an average of 7.4 percent a year since 2006, volumes in the sector grew at less than 3 percent.By contrast, import volumes have been running at twice that pace, in part because miners have been shopping for everything from remote-controlled trucks to platforms.That has an impact, as volumes are what count when measuring real, or inflation-adjusted, gross domestic product.As a result, net export volumes have subtracted from G.D.P. for no less than 20 of the last 27 quarters, even though the value of those exports rose sharply.That cycle is expected to turn positive in coming years as shipments expand and miners need to import less equipment as projects are finished.Wayne Cole is a Reuters correspondent.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/dispute-with-antigua-and-barbuda-threatens-us-copyrights.html,"WASHINGTON — A long-simmering trade conflict between the United States and Antigua and Barbuda appears to be boiling over.Antigua and Barbuda, which has a $1 billion economy, is planning on getting legal retribution from the United States’ $15 trillion economy over its refusal to let Americans gamble at online sites based in the Caribbean nation — perhaps by offering downloads of American intellectual property, like Hollywood films, network television shows or hit pop songs. On Monday, the World Trade Organization gave its go-ahead for Antigua and Barbuda’s tentative plan.“The economy of Antigua and Barbuda has been devastated by the United States government’s long campaign to prevent American consumers from gambling,” Harold Lovell, Antigua’s finance minister, said in a statement. “These aggressive efforts to shut down the remote gaming industry in Antigua have resulted in the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and seizure by the Americans of billions of dollars belonging to gaming operators and their customers.”The conflict’s roots are a decade old. The World Trade Organization said that the United States had violated its trade agreements by preventing Americans from betting at sites based in Antigua and Barbuda. Because Washington is unwilling to make the betting legal, the countries have been locked in a dispute over what constitutes fair trade practices and fair compensation.The online gambling industry was at one point the second-largest employer in the Caribbean country, its government has said, and economists estimated its worth at $3.4 billion. Gambling employment has dropped to fewer than 500 people from more than 4,000 as a result of the United States’ trade policy, it said.On Monday, a dispute settlement body in Geneva gave Antigua and Barbuda the nod to, in essence, violate American intellectual property rights to make up its losses, calculated at $21 million a year.It remains murky just how the Antigua and Barbuda government might go about it. But trade watchers suggested it might set up a site where viewers could pay a pittance to watch a film or television show with an American copyright. The United States might not be able to shut the site down under international law.“We are disappointed with Antigua and Barbuda’s decision to abandon constructive settlement discussions,” Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, said in an e-mail. “As recently as Friday, our two countries held high-level discussions on possible settlement options that would have brought real benefits to Antigua’s businesses and people.”The Obama administration said that the proposed plan might further hurt trade relations between the two countries.“If Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft of intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua’s own interests,” Ms. Harmon said. “Government-authorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major impediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries.”Trade experts said that Antigua and Barbuda’s plan for retribution seemed designed to provoke American filmmakers and recording artists into pushing for Congress to allow foreign Internet gambling sites to serve American customers.They also noted that it was the United States that had pushed for the unusual “cross-retaliation” mechanism at the W.T.O., where trade violations that hurt one industry could be countered with trade actions against a completely different industry.“The irony is rich, rich, rich,” said Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group.“The practical question is, Is there a majority in the House and Senate to vote to revoke the ban, and would Congress do it because the W.T.O. told them?” she said, saying it was unclear how the two countries would proceed."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/world/middleeast/group-criticizes-israeli-armys-crowd-control-methods.html,"An Israeli human rights group on Monday accused the military of “extensively and systematically” violating its own rules of engagement in suppressing Palestinian demonstrators in the West Bank, contributing to dozens of deaths in recent years. According to a report by the group B’Tselem, 56 Palestinians have been killed in clashes with the Israeli military since 2005, most of them when live ammunition was fired at stone throwers. The Israeli military dismissed the report as biased, and said it focused on events that were old or still under investigation. It called specific episodes in the report exceptions to military policy, not the rule."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/us/boy-scouts-consider-lifting-ban-on-gay-leaders.html,"The Boy Scouts of America, with its traditions of youth in uniform and the character-building virtues of honor, has always looked back to an older, more structured image of America, when gay and lesbian people were invisible and silent. It was a view reaffirmed in Scout policy as recently as seven months ago. Openly gay scouts and scout leaders need not apply.The announcement on Monday by Scouts officials that the ban on gays was in line for elimination was thus a thunderclap on two fronts, scouts and people close to the organization said. First, it removed from discussion the idea, voiced in July by senior national scout leaders, that the ban was in the best interests of scouts themselves.Perhaps even more momentous was the acknowledgment that scouting itself had moved on, with a diversity of thought like the multicultural and sexually diverse buzz of modern America itself, that no longer could be confined or defined by a dictated policy from headquarters. Local chapters would be able to decide whether to admit gay scouts.“The Boy Scouts would not, under any circumstances, dictate a position to units, members, or parents,” said a spokesman for the Boy Scouts of America, Deron Smith, in a statement. “This would mean there would no longer be any national policy regarding sexual orientation, and the chartered organizations that oversee and deliver Scouting would accept membership and select leaders consistent with each organization’s mission, principles, or religious beliefs.”Scout officials gave no timeline for making a formal decision, or for putting the policy into effect, but a spokeswoman said in an e-mail that discussion was anticipated at next week’s national executive board meeting. Board meetings are private and closed to the public and the news media, she said.In 2000, the Supreme Court affirmed the Boy Scouts’ right to refuse gay members.Groups that had pushed for the change said that even if senior scout leaders had second thoughts about the policy, it would probably be too late.“The Boy Scouts of America have heard from scouts, corporations and millions of Americans that discriminating against gay scouts and scout leaders is wrong,” said Herndon Graddick, the president of Glaad, an advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. “Scouting is a valuable institution, and this change will only strengthen its core principles of fairness and respect.”Mr. Smith, the Scouts spokesman, said that under the proposed policy, “the B.S.A. would not require any chartered organization to act in ways inconsistent with that organization’s mission, principles, or religious beliefs.” He said that members and parents would be able to choose a local unit that best met the needs of their families.Critics and supporters alike said that abandoning national policy for local control could have unintended consequences.Tony Perkins, the president of the Family Research Council, a conservative group, said in a statement: “If the board capitulates to the bullying of homosexual activists, the Boy Scouts’ legacy of producing great leaders will become yet another casualty of moral compromise. The Boy Scouts should stand firm.”Zach Wahls, whose group has been working for more inclusive rules under the motto, “A scout is equal,” said he applauded the change.“It’s a step in the right direction, and good to see that B.S.A. is softening its position,” he said. “But under the policy change, it will still be possible for some units to discriminate.”The question of gay scouts and leaders has not been the only cloud on scouting’s horizon.Revelations about sexual abuse by scout leaders, which have increasingly emerged in recent years, with some victims and parents saying the organization shielded predators, have tarnished the group’s reputation as being always protective of youth.But for a structurally conservative leadership, as people inside the organization describe it, the ban on gay leaders created a kind of crosswind that compounded the issue: Would removing the ban alienate tradition-minded families who might fear gay leaders? Or would lifting the ban attract a new generation of scouts?Meanwhile, a pressure for change has been surging from within.A California chapter of the Boy Scouts of America said recently that it would directly challenge the ban on gays by recommending that an openly gay former scout, Ryan Andresen, 18, be awarded the rank of Eagle, scouting’s top honor.Mr. Andresen’s father, Eric, who has been working with groups representing gay scouts, said in an interview that even he was astonished by the pace of change.He said he remained firm in his belief that scouting has value. “It will open the door to an awful lot of kids to stay with scouting or get involved in scouting in the first place, and that’s really important,” he said.The potential change in the Boy Scouts of America’s policy regarding gay scouts also came after demands from gay organizations that a coming show on the National Geographic Channel called “Are You Tougher Than a Boy Scout?” contain a disclaimer denouncing the Boy Scouts for discriminating against gay candidates for membership.The show, which is scheduled to begin on the channel on March 4, is a competition show that pits active scouts against adults who have never been scouts in tasks typical of what is asked of Boy Scout members.The pressure against the cable network was only one of many actions that gay groups have taken against the Boy Scouts of America, but a spokesman for the National Geographic Channel, Chris Albert, said the protest against the show seemed to be at least somewhat responsible for the reconsideration of the policy.“Obviously I can’t say for sure,” Mr. Albert said in a telephone interview. “But I think the discussion around our show amplified the importance of this issue. And we think this is certainly a step in the right direction.”"

The companies later said the deal was done.Last month, the Wanxiang unit agreed to pay $257 million for A123’s automotive battery business and related assets in a bankruptcy auction, beating Johnson Controls.But the transaction still needed approval by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, a government body led by the Treasury secretary. The committee approved the deal on Monday night, according to Wanxiang.Some members of Congress and the Strategic Materials Advisory Council, a group including retired military leaders that is focused on protecting the American industrial supply chain, said the sale to Wanxiang could jeopardize American energy security and they asked the committee to block it.A123 had received a $249 million federal grant as part of a program to promote clean energy, although about half of that money was never released.The company filed for bankruptcy in October because of weaker-than-expected demand for hybrid vehicles and technical problems.The company makes batteries for Fisker Automotive, BMW hybrid 3- and 5-Series cars, and General Motors’ new all-electric Chevrolet Spark."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/health/to-open-eyes-w-2s-list-cost-of-health-plans.html,"WASHINGTON — As workers open their W-2 forms this month, many will see a new box with information on the total cost of employer-sponsored health insurance coverage. To some, it will be a surprise, perhaps even a shock.Workers often have little idea how much they and their employers are paying for coverage. In many cases, economists say, workers give up cash compensation to get and keep health benefits.The disclosures, required by the 2010 health care law, are meant to make workers more cost-conscious. Health benefits are still tax-free. But labor unions and employer groups say it could be easier to tax them in the future, now that employers must report their value to the government.The new information appears in Box 12 of the standard W-2 form, with a two-letter code, DD. The box shows the “cost of employer-sponsored health coverage.” And that amount is not taxable, the Internal Revenue Service says on the back of the form.Jay J. Makled, a union steward for the United Automobile Workers at the Ford plant in Dearborn, Mich., described his reaction after seeing that his health coverage cost nearly $16,000 last year: “It’s quite expensive. I was surprised to see how much the company was paying for that benefit.”Hourly employees represented by the union there said they generally did not pay any of the premium.The number on the W-2 form is supposed to reflect the part of the cost paid by the employer and the part paid by the employee.Prof. Nicole Huberfeld, an expert on health law at the University of Kentucky, who received her W-2 form on Monday, said, “Most people who get health insurance from their employers have no idea how much it costs.”“People are often shocked when they see the cost, $12,000 to $16,000 a year,” Ms. Huberfeld said. “Many Americans believe this is something they get free. But employers pay lower wages because they provide insurance.”In 2012, according to an annual survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, premiums for employer-sponsored health insurance averaged $5,615 a year for single coverage and $15,745 for family coverage. Over five years, the costs have increased 25 percent for individual coverage and 30 percent for family coverage.“Health coverage is a big piece of people’s income and a large part of the social welfare budget,” said C. Eugene Steuerle, a tax economist at the Urban Institute. “But the benefits are not taxable, and most of the spending is hidden, so we don’t consider the trade-offs. If we want to get control of health care costs, people have to be aware of them.”That is the goal of the disclosure requirement, which was proposed by a bipartisan group of senators: two Republicans, Charles E. Grassley of Iowa and Michael B. Enzi of Wyoming, and two Democrats, Max Baucus of Montana and Ron Wyden of Oregon.Congress acted after Peter R. Orszag, then the director of the Congressional Budget Office, told lawmakers: “The economic evidence is overwhelming, the theory is overwhelming, that when your firm pays for your health insurance, you actually pay through reduced take-home pay. The firm is not giving that to you for free.”The tax-free treatment of employer-provided health benefits is the largest tax break in the tax code, costing the government roughly $180 billion a year in lost revenue, or 80 percent more than the home mortgage interest deduction, according to the administration.Katie W. Mahoney, the executive director of health policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said, “It’s useful for employees to know the value of coverage their employers provide.” But she said some employers worried that reporting the benefit on the W-2 form could lead to taxing the benefit.“That’s not the intent of the current requirement,” Ms. Mahoney said. “But once the information is collected by the government, it’s very easy for another administration to have a different intent.”An employee of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. whose health coverage was listed as costing more than $20,000 said: “That knocks my socks off. When I saw the number, my eyes popped out. I appreciate my employer all the more.”The employee said he had been told not to discuss the cost publicly because the union did not want to suggest that some employees had “Cadillac coverage.”An employer that fails to comply with the reporting requirement could be subject to penalties of $200 per W-2 form, up to a maximum of $3 million, tax lawyers said.Employers are exempt from the reporting obligation if they are required to file fewer than 250 W-2 forms, the I.R.S. said. That could change, but the agency said employers would be given at least six months’ notice."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/us/politics/give-up-pay-many-lawmakers-would-feel-little-pain.html,"WASHINGTON — In principle, it sounds self-sacrificing, even noble: Congress swears off collecting its paychecks until it passes a budget.But behind the “no budget, no pay” proposal, which the House passed last week when it voted to temporarily extend the debt limit, is also a basic reality: many of those who support the concept are so wealthy that their Congressional paychecks represent little more than a rounding error.Take Representative Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican who led the charge on the measure in the House. He has a net worth between $3.8 million and $9.7 million, according to an analysis of his most recent financial disclosure by the Center for Responsive Politics.That is not exactly a fortune befitting a Rockefeller or a Kennedy, but it is more than enough to cushion any discomfort he might feel from missing a few paydays. Many of the other lawmakers who have championed “no budget, no pay,” both Republicans and Democrats, are similarly wealthy.Congress, for all its democratic trappings, has long been richer than a typical collection of 535 Americans. But the gap between the financial standing of members and the population as a whole appears to have grown in recent decades, analysts of financial disclosure forms say.As many ordinary Americans have struggled to get by in recent years, members of Congress were largely insulated from the economic downturn, based on their net worth. The median net worth of American households is $66,740, while for the 535 members of Congress it is about $966,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Congressional lawmakers earn at least $174,000 a year.The Democratic co-sponsor of the “no budget, no pay” bill in the Senate, Joe Manchin III of West Virginia, is worth between $3.6 million and $11.7 million, according to the center’s tallies. The other Senate co-sponsor, Dean Heller, Republican of Nevada, is worth less but is still doing just fine, with a net worth of between $2.8 million and $3.4 million. The Senate may pass the measure as early as Wednesday.When the debt limit extension passed the House last week, the chamber’s three wealthiest members voted yes:  Michael McCaul, Republican of Texas (net worth estimated at $500 million, from Clear Channel Communications, founded by his wife’s family); Darrell Issa, Republican of California ($480 million, from Viper car alarms); and Jared Polis, Democrat of Colorado ($215 million, from the greeting card Web site Blue Mountain).Representative Scott Rigell, Republican of Virginia, also pushed for the provision. His estimated net worth is as high as $52 million, and he returns 15 percent of his Congressional paycheck each year.“One thing I’ve never called for is an outright reduction in salary, because I do appreciate that members come from different walks of life,” Mr. Rigell said. But as imperfect a solution as withholding pay might be, he said the concept was sound. “I am convinced that is a big enough lever to influence the institution,” he said, “and it needs it.”Since 1974, Congress has been required to pass a nonbinding annual budget. But the Senate has failed to pass a budget in the past three years, in part because Democratic leaders did not want to subject embattled members to tough spending votes.As moneyed as Congress is these days, some members would feel the pinch if they stopped receiving their paychecks. Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, has a reported net worth of no higher than $300,000, making him one of the few nonmillionaires to support the bill. That also makes him the fifth-poorest member of the Senate, according to the figures from the Center for Responsive Politics.In the House, more than a few members have an estimated net worth that is a negative figure, meaning their financial liabilities are greater than their assets.Disagreements about the provision’s effectiveness aside, some have raised questions about whether it is constitutional.The debt limit extension bill says that if either chamber of Congress fails to approve a budget resolution for the next fiscal year by April 15, members’ paychecks are to be held in an escrow account until a measure passes — or, if that never happens, until the end of the 113th Congress in early 2015.Opponents have argued that this may run afoul of the 27th Amendment, which says lawmakers cannot vary their compensation in a single Congress.“It’s clearly unconstitutional, and we shouldn’t do unconstitutional things,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of New York, who noted almost as a point of pride that he was one of the House’s poorest members.But Mr. Nadler said he had other issues with the plan as well, including that he felt it was coercive and could force members to vote for legislation they thought was flawed.And he said he was concerned about the precedent it would set. “If you want only millionaires to be in Congress,” he said, “this is a good idea.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/realestate/commercial/government-offers-to-swap-for-a-new-fbi-headquarters.html,"WASHINGTON — For nearly 40 years, the F.B.I. has had its headquarters in a massive example of Brutalist architecture on Pennsylvania Avenue. But the federal government hopes to swap the building and its prime location for a sprawling new home in the suburbs, and there seem to be plenty of developers eager to help make that happen.The General Services Administration, the federal government’s landlord, held an “industry day” this month to lay out its wish list for new F.B.I. headquarters, drawing more than 450 interested developers, architects, brokers and consultants.“The property on Pennsylvania Avenue is pretty much irreplaceable real estate,” said P. Brian Connolly, senior vice president of Akridge, a major Washington real estate development and management firm. “Real estate is all about location. It’s just a great location.”The G.S.A. meeting was the largest for any such offering in memory, administration officials said. Those in attendance included many well-known industry names, among them the engineering firm Greenhorne & O’Mara; the architectural firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill; Lockheed Martin; Booz Allen Hamilton; Siemens Government Technologies; Jones Lang LaSalle; Tishman Speyer; and Boston Properties.“Everybody is salivating for this,” said Ron Kendall, a real estate consultant representing a major local developer that did not want to be publicly identified.When the monolithic F.B.I. building was completed on Pennsylvania Avenue in 1974, it was, if not a bright light, then at least a glimmer of hope in what was a stagnant downtown in the nation’s capital. White flight from the shopping district had followed the 1968 racial riots, and private disinvestment had accelerated.If the new building was austere and unwelcoming, with no ground floor windows or retail space, it seemed nonetheless to meet the needs of the agency for space to store files and house its thousands of employees, who it was hoped would inject a modicum of consumer spending into a commercial district that had fallen on hard times.Today, the area around the building, named for the longtime director J. Edgar Hoover, is booming with new life — new restaurants, upscale shops and high-end residential apartments — in a stylish neighborhood now known as Penn Quarter. The building itself is deemed obsolete as headquarters for today’s Federal Bureau of Investigation.The G.S.A. hopes to find a developer willing to take over the 2.4 million-square-foot F.B.I. building, and the now highly valued land on which it sits, and build new, 2.1 million-square-foot headquarters on up to 55 acres in the Washington area.Though the idea is still in its infancy, it has set off a spirited regional competition to land the prestigious federal agency, with local officials fielding calls from prospective developers and others. Written expressions of interest are due March 24 and the administration expects to issue a formal request for proposals this year.The F.B.I. wants to consolidate its 11,000-employee headquarters staff, now scattered in 20 locations in the area, including the downtown building. For interested parties, it promises to be a high-stakes, long-term investment: any return could be years away, since the new headquarters must be built before the F.B.I. building is swapped. But enthusiasm still runs high.The overflow crowd at this month’s meeting “bodes pretty well for this project,” Daniel M. Tangherlini, acting administrator at the General Services Administration, told the group. “We’re looking at the interest of the market in doing this kind of business with us. The amount of interest has continued to grow.”The F.B.I. building, Mr. Tangherlini said, served its purpose. “It was developed as a giant file cabinet,” he said, “a disk drive before disk drives, to make storage and retrieval of paper easier. The F.B.I. is much less about that now; they’re stuck with a building representing the technology of a generation or two ago.”He said it would be too costly to renovate or to demolish and rebuild the F.B.I. building at its current site. “It costs too much to operate and diminishes the quality of downtown,” he said. “The neighborhood is completely different now.”But there is more to the project than the F.B.I.’s changing needs. A politically damaging scandal over conference expenses last year forced Mr. Tangherlini’s predecessor to resign and brought about a “top to bottom review” of the agency’s operations, Mr. Tangherlini said, leading it to tighten its belt by looking for new and more economical ways to house government agencies.Thus, the government wants to dispose of unused or underused properties and, in the case of the F.B.I., take advantage of the property to get a new headquarters building that will cost the government less. The G.S.A. is also seeking to sell an unused heating plant in Georgetown and several underused federal buildings in southwest Washington, but meetings on those projects each turned out only 100 interested parties.Politics could also play a part in the ultimate decision. Members of Maryland’s Congressional delegation, including both senators and Steny H. Hoyer, the House minority whip, have publicly supported a site in Prince George’s County, part of which is in Mr. Hoyer’s district. A Senate committee resolution said the new headquarters should be within two miles of a Metro station and two and a half miles from the Beltway, but Mr. Tangherlini said the G.S.A. would be flexible in applying those requirements.At the January meeting, David S. Iannucci, an economic development official in Prince George’s County, was seen chatting with representatives from the Atlanta office of Walton Development and Management, whose headquarters are in Calgary, Alberta.Mr. Iannucci said the firm had recently purchased 2,000 acres in his county, where land is cheaper than in some other jurisdictions. “We get phone calls practically every day from regional and national developers” interested in the F.B.I. project, he said. “All the jurisdictions in the area are focusing on this.”Steven A. Silverman, Mr. Iannucci’s counterpart in neighboring Montgomery County, Md., said: “We are all suggesting possible sites based on what the private sector is telling us. This is the largest real estate deal in the last 10 years, and of course we’re interested.”Officials in the District of Columbia and Northern Virginia are also in the game. Jim Herbert, economic development officer for Loudoun County, Va., home to Dulles International Airport, said his jurisdiction, in the suburban outer ring, offered a planned extension of the region’s commuter Metrorail system and more undeveloped farmland. “You get more for the dollar if you don’t have to deal with pre-existing structures,” he said. “We’ve got a lot of developers who are very interested.”Mr. Connolly, of Akridge, noted that more than land would be involved in meeting the agency’s requirements.“Anything the F.B.I. does is going to be a highly secured campus, is going to have a very sophisticated communications system, very sophisticated electronic demands and needs,” he said. “There will be plenty of redundancy built into the project, because the F.B.I. can never afford to lose power.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/business/global/india-lowers-benchmark-interest-rate-to-fuel-growth.html,"MUMBAI — India’s central bank lowered its key policy rate on Tuesday, as expected, for the first time in nine months to support an economy that is poised for its slowest growth in a decade, but signaled there was less room for aggressive cuts because of concerns over inflation.The Reserve Bank of India cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 of a percentage point to 7.75 percent, in line with a Reuters poll this month.The central bank unexpectedly also reduced the cash reserve ratio, the share of deposits banks must keep with the central bank, by 0.25 of a percentage point to 4 percent, which will pump an additional 180 billion rupees, or $3.3 billion, into the banking system.India’s headline inflation rate moderated to a three-year low of 7.18 percent in December, and the central bank said there was likelihood that inflation would remain around current levels heading into the 2013-14 fiscal year, which starts in April.“This provides space, albeit limited, for monetary policy to give greater emphasis to growth risks,” the central bank said in its quarterly monetary policy review.Bond and stock markets were largely unmoved as dealers had already priced in a quarter-percentage-point rate cut. The 10-year bond yield was flat at about 7.87 percent. India’s main NSE index was also flat, with the bank sub-index up 0.2 percent, paring initial stronger gains.The Indian rupee strengthened to 53.79 to the dollar from about 53.84 before the decision.“RBI has not abandoned its cautious stance, stressing on the ‘calibrated and limited’ nature of rate support,” said Radhika Rao, an economist at Forecast Pte in Singapore. “The scale of rate cuts is closely tied to the government’s sustained efforts to correct the twin imbalances and moderating inflation trajectory.”The central bank, however, reiterated its concerns over a bloated fiscal and current account deficits, adding that its pro-growth stance would be conditioned by the management of the risks posed by them.“Financing the CAD with increasingly risky and volatile flows increases the economy’s vulnerability to sudden shifts in risk appetite and liquidity preference, potentially threatening macroeconomic and exchange rate stability,” the bank said, referring to the current account deficit.Since a 0.5 percentage point cut in April, the central bank had kept interest rates on hold as inflation stayed stubbornly high, ignoring repeated calls from the government for a cut.Having grown at near-double-digit pace before the Lehman Brothers crisis, the economy has suffered a rapid deceleration.The central bank cut its G.D.P. growth forecast for Asia’s third-largest economy to 5.5 percent for the current fiscal year, from 5.8 percent previously, and lowered its projection for headline inflation in March to 6.8 percent from 7.5 percent earlier."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/business/judge-dismisses-suit-against-kaplan-over-hiring-practices.html,"A federal judge in Ohio has dismissed a lawsuit that accused the Kaplan Higher Education Corporation of discriminating against black job applicants.In a ruling issued on Monday, Judge Patricia A. Gaughan of the Northern District of Ohio granted partial summary judgment in a case in which the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission had contended that Kaplan in effect discriminated against African-American applicants by rejecting some job seekers because of their credit histories. The commission has asserted that rejections based on aspects of applicant’s credit histories, like falling behind on bill-paying, have a disparate effect on black applicants without being directly relevant to their future job performance.Judge Gaughan granted Kaplan’s motion to exclude an expert witness for the E.E.O.C., concluding that the way he determined which applicants were black was unscientific and unreliable. The expert witness had assembled a group of five “race raters” to look at photos of the job applicants and then say which ones they thought were black.In granting the motion to exclude the expert’s testimony, Judge Gaughan said the commission no longer had the evidence needed to make its case.Kaplan, which is a unit of The Washington Post Company, welcomed the ruling. “Kaplan maintained from the beginning that the E.E.O.C. lawsuit was without merit,” the company said in a statement. “Our practices mirrored what is standard practice for many private companies and some government agencies.”A spokeswoman for the E.E.O.C. said that the commission “is reviewing the district court’s decision carefully and is considering all options.” Several states, including Hawaii, Oregon and Illinois, have banned or limited the use of credit reports in hiring, partly out of concern that this practice could prevent unemployed, financially pressed Americans from getting back into the work force."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/business/north-american-results-bolster-ford-earnings.html,"DETROIT — Last year, Ford Motor broke ranks with other auto companies when it announced major cuts in its troubled European operations, including the closing of three factories, to address a sharp downturn in sales on the continent and an oversupply of vehicles.On Tuesday, Ford, the second-biggest American automaker, behind General Motors, startled the industry again by predicting that Europe, a critical market, would get worse before it begins improving later this year.Ford said European auto sales, including commercial vehicles, could fall as low as 13 million this year, and its own annual losses in the region could reach $2 billion. Europe is Ford’s second-largest market, after North America.“The industry did 14 million last year, and that was the worst in 20 years,” Bob Shanks, Ford’s chief financial officer, said in an interview. “But the industry is continuing to decline, and we think 13 million is the trough.”The dire predictions for Europe overshadowed what were otherwise positive fourth-quarter results, which Ford reported on Tuesday.The company reported a 54 percent gain in adjusted fourth-quarter profit as strong earnings in North America compensated for heavy losses in Europe. Ford said it earned $1.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012 compared with $1.03 billion a year earlier, excluding the impact of tax-valuation allowances in 2011. Those allowances inflated last year’s fourth-quarter net income to $13.6 billion.For the full year, Ford said it earned $5.67 billion, a 5 percent drop from $5.97 billion in 2011, not including the tax-valuation changes, which increased the 2011 earnings to $20.2 billion.The auto market in Western Europe remains abysmal, but some analysts agree with Ford’s assessment that sales may be close to their low point and could start to recover late this year as the euro zone crisis subsides.Analysts at Goldman Sachs forecast that European auto sales would fall an additional 2.2 percent in 2013, to 12.9 million vehicles. But they will rise 3.9 percent in 2014, Goldman predicted, as car buyers start to feel more secure about their economic prospects.In the meantime, though, companies like General Motors’ Opel unit and PSA Peugeot Citröen are trying to make broad reductions in jobs and production capacity.The recovery, if it comes, could be too late for many workers and even some of the manufacturers.The companies that have suffered the most are those that depend on the mass market and on southern Europe, including Fiat, Peugeot and Renault. Steady declines in sales since 2007 have left two-thirds of European auto plants operating at a loss, Goldman Sachs analysts estimated.North American sales have been a bright spot for the world’s automakers, and Ford is no exception. Ford’s overall revenue in the fourth quarter was $36.5 billion, a 5 percent increase from $34.6 billion in the same period a year earlier. For all of 2012, revenue was $134.3 billion, 1 percent less than $136.3 billion in 2011.Healthy sales of new vehicles in North America resulted in good profit margins, particularly in the United States, where the overall industry grew 13 percent last year.Ford said it had $1.87 billion in pretax earnings in North America during the quarter, a 110 percent increase from $889 million in the fourth quarter of 2011. For all of 2012, Ford had pretax profit of $8.34 billion in North America, compared with $6.19 billion in 2011.But the company’s European operations continued to struggle as overall demand plunged, particularly in southern Europe.Ford reported a $732 million pretax loss in Europe for the fourth quarter, compared with a $190 million loss in the same period in 2011.For all of 2012, Ford said it had a pretax loss of $1.75 billion in the region. By comparison, the company reported a loss of $27 million in Europe for all of 2011.Investors, apparently shaken by the scale of the losses and Ford’s dismal forecast for 2013, sent the automaker’s shares down nearly 5 percent to $13.14 in Tuesday’s trading.Industry analysts said Ford’s fourth-quarter European losses were higher than they had expected. They expressed doubt about how soon demand would recover in hard-hit markets like France, Italy and Spain.“Management indicated that Europe would be worse in 2013, suggested that the bottom has not necessarily been reached,” Matthew Stover, an analyst with Guggenheim Securities, said in a research note to investors.Ford plans to reduce its production capacity in Europe by 18 percent and eliminate 5,700 jobs by next year. The company will close an assembly plant in Belgium and two factories in England as part of that cost-cutting.Mr. Shanks said Ford was confident that the European industry would begin a steady recovery by 2014 and that Ford could again be profitable there by mid-decade.However, he did not rule out further cost-cutting measures if demand continued to deteriorate. “If we think we need to do more, we will do more,” he said.Other auto companies in the region are expected to post weak fourth-quarter results, starting with the Italian automaker Fiat, which is scheduled to report its 2012 earnings on Wednesday.G.M. is trying to accelerate the planned 2016 closing of an assembly plant in Bochum, Germany. But efforts to cut factory capacity have met resistance from labor unions. On Tuesday, the union representing Opel workers reiterated a demand that G.M. guarantee jobs at its German plants for another four years.While Europe is Ford’s most pressing trouble spot, the company also faces challenges in South America and Asia.Ford’s chief executive, Alan R. Mulally, said the company’s efforts to globalize its products have helped it weather the downturn in Europe while it expands in Asia and delivers new models in North America.The company’s strong performance in North America translated into hefty profit-sharing checks for its American workers. Ford said it would pay an average of $8,300 to each of its 45,800 hourly workers in March."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/nyregion/bloomberg-calls-for-spending-limits-but-no-tax-increases.html,"Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, proposing a New York budget for the 12th and last time, called on Tuesday for agencies across the city to cut costs as he seeks to keep spending flat despite the prospective loss of hundreds of millions of dollars in state education aid because of a labor dispute.Mr. Bloomberg offered no major new initiatives, but said the city would spend billions of dollars to rebuild after Hurricane Sandy. All of that money, he said, would be supplied by the federal government.The mayor proposed closing 20 firehouses, reducing thousands of city-financed child-care slots, and cutting thousands of teacher positions — all suggestions he had made in past years, but had dropped after resistance from the City Council.Over all, Mr. Bloomberg proposed a $70.1 billion budget for the 2014 fiscal year, which begins on July 1. That is $1.6 billion more than the one approved by the Council for the current fiscal year. But because of emergency city spending connected to the hurricane, the actual figure in the current fiscal year will be $70.4 billion — meaning that Mr. Bloomberg is proposing a slightly leaner budget.Much of the increase stems from costs that the city says it cannot control, like those of pensions, health care, Medicaid and debt service. But Mr. Bloomberg said an improving national economy, the recovery on Wall Street and the city’s increasingly diversified economy would cushion the blow.“We’ve done a lot,” he said. “You can always do more, but you can only fight so many battles at a time. We’ve gone through Sandy, we’ve gone through Irene, we’ve gone through a mortgage crisis, and yet with all of those things, the city’s budget is still in balance.”But looming large over the mayor’s budget was the uncertainty over an increasingly bitter dispute between the administration and the teachers union, the United Federation of Teachers, concerning a teacher evaluation system.On Monday, Mr. Bloomberg warned of imminent fiscal pain during testimony in Albany, where he urged the State Legislature to intervene so that the city did not lose hundreds of millions of state dollars because it missed a deadline this month to finish negotiating the evaluation system.And while he noted on Tuesday that the $13.9 billion budget for education he proposed was $8 billion more than when he took office, he also said that the loss of education money would have an impact on schools across the city.To make up for the lost money, the city would keep 700 fewer teachers on the payroll this school year, with staff reductions coming mainly through attrition, “as well as the reduction of funds for extracurricular activities and after-school programming,” according to a budget summary. An additional 1,100 teaching positions would be at risk in the 2014 fiscal year.After the mayor made his presentation, many city officials — including several hoping to succeed Mr. Bloomberg as mayor — expressed exasperation or anger over the education stalemate.Christine C. Quinn, the Council speaker, who has been a strong ally of Mr. Bloomberg, said she had “serious concerns” and that a failure to reach a deal would be “potentially devastating.” She also said that she was “concerned” about the mayor’s proposal, which he has made before, to close 20 firehouses, and make deep cuts to after-school programs.John C. Liu, the comptroller and a frequent critic of the mayor, said that the mayor wanted to “scapegoat” teachers and that “his reliance on one-shots and a ‘my way or the highway’ negotiation strategy” could mean that children “will pay the price.”And Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, who, like Ms. Quinn and Mr. Liu, is running for mayor, suggested that Mr. Bloomberg needed to demonstrate more leadership because “it’s the role of the mayor to bring people to the table.”There were also a few uncertainties in Mr. Bloomberg’s budget. He is counting on $600 million from a plan to sell 2,000 new yellow-taxi medallions that remains tied up in court.His spending plan also assumes that there will be no raises in labor contracts that expired after 2010 — something that might be difficult for his successor to swallow, especially if unions help a Democrat win the election.“The next mayor’s going to have some very, very serious problems — very,” said Carol Kellermann, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, referring to the expired contracts. “That is a very serious problem looming, and nobody seems to have an answer for it. The mayor is correct to say, ‘Look, there’s no money,’ but I don’t know that the next mayor is going to feel that that is a sufficient answer. I think it’s something we’re going to have to talk about in the course of the campaign.”When asked by reporters whether he would leave the city on sounder fiscal footing, as he promised when he took office in 2002 and inherited a $4.8 billion deficit in a $42.3 billion budget, he said, “I think so.”Later, when asked to reflect on how he felt presenting his final preliminary budget proposal, Mr. Bloomberg sounded wistful and hardly ready to move on.“I would be hard pressed to come up with anything that I have had to do in the last 11 years and almost one month that I did not enjoy and look at as a challenge,” he said. After all, he said, there were still 336 days left in his term, and he was planning to make the most of them."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"A report on growth served as a reminder on Wednesday that the American economy remained a long way from being healed, and it put the brakes on a January rally that pushed stocks close to record levels.Stocks started the day lower after a report showed that the economy had unexpectedly contracted in the fourth quarter, leading the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index to its biggest drop of the year.The Dow Jones industrial average fell 44 points, or 0.3 percent, to close at 13,910.42, logging only its second decline in nine days. The S.& P. fell 6 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,501.96, its biggest decline since Dec. 28. The Nasdaq composite fell 11 points to 3,142.31.The Commerce Department report covered the quarter from October through December, when the economy was hurt by the biggest cut in military spending in 40 years, fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles.The Federal Reserve acknowledged that the economy was still struggling to regain momentum in a statement Wednesday afternoon after its two-day meeting. The Fed said that growth had “paused in recent months.”The central bank took no new action and said it would continue spending on bonds as part of its plan to keep borrowing costs low to spur growth.“The Fed didn’t really say anything out of the ordinary, so you got the reaction you should’ve had in the morning,” said Joseph Saluzzi, a co-founder of the brokerage firm Themis Trading. “When you’ve spent this much money trying to prop up an economy and you still come up with a negative print, that’s bad news.”Still, stocks remain on track for a great January over all.The Dow Jones average has surged 6.2 percent since the start of the year, climbing close to 14,000 and within touching distance of its record level. The S.& P. 500 has gained 5.3 percent this month, close to its highest level in more than five years. Investors bought stocks after lawmakers reached a deal on taxes and spending and on optimism the American housing market was recovering and the jobs market was slowly getting better.United States gross domestic product, the volume of all goods and services produced, contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter, the growth report showed, a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate for the quarter from July through September.“To ignore this is folly,” said Douglas Coté, chief market strategist at ING Investment Management. “Certainly, this market could continue to move forward, but ignoring the fundamentals is not something I’d counsel my clients to do.”Positive reports of company earnings helped offset the disappointing news about the economy and stemmed a bigger decline on Wednesday.Amazon jumped $12.41, or 4.8 percent, to $272.76 after the world’s biggest online retailer showed improving profit margins when it posted fourth-quarter earnings late Tuesday.Boeing, currently trying to fix battery problems that have grounded its 787 Dreamliner passenger jets, gained 94 cents, or 1.3 percent, to $74.59 after it reported earnings that beat analysts’ expectations. Rising profits from commercial jets offset a smaller profit from defense work.A private survey showed Wednesday that United States businesses increased hiring in January compared with a revised December reading. The payroll processor ADP said that employers added 192,000 jobs in January.Inflation rates were steady. The benchmark 10-year Treasury note rose 2/32 to 96 24/32, and the yield, which moves inversely to its price, fell to 1.99 percent, from 2.00 on Tuesday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/technology/nintendo-warns-of-weak-wii-u-sales.html,"TOKYO — Nintendo said on Wednesday that it expected to sell far fewer units of its Wii U game console than it had anticipated, reducing the sales outlook for its flagship device just two months after its release.Nintendo has a lot riding on the Wii U, the successor to the Wii, which revolutionized the gaming industry seven years ago with a casual approach that brought video games to new audiences. The company is banking on the Wii U to revive its fortunes after the disappointing introduction in 2011 of its hand-held gaming machine, the 3DS, which prompted the company to reduce its price sharply to stoke demand.Nintendo executives had also said the Wii U would prove that dedicated game systems still had a future in a world now teeming with less expensive, more convenient mobile games played on smartphones and tablets.The latest numbers from Nintendo are not promising. The company said that it had sold 3.06 million Wii U games and that it expected sales to reach just four million units through March, almost 30 percent less than a previous projection of 5.5 million.Nintendo also downgraded its 3DS sales expectations, saying that it would sell 15 million units through March instead of the 17.5 million units it previously forecast, and that it expected to sell fewer games.“Nintendo needs a change in strategy,” said Michael Pachter, a gaming research analyst for Wedbush Securities, a Los Angeles-based investment firm. He said that Nintendo had botched the Wii U design — a touch screen used together with a television — and that the device was unimpressive for dedicated gamers and baffling for casual ones.Nintendo executives need to reorganize the company so it will continue to be profitable even with lower hardware sales, Mr. Pachter said. He also said the company should consider developing smartphone games, a move Nintendo has resisted.“Smartphones and tablets are nibbling away at the edges of the market for games,” he said. “If they can’t beat it, they should consider making money off it. Why can’t Mario be on the smartphone?”Still, Nintendo returned to profitability for the first nine months of its business year, largely thanks to the weakening of the yen. That lowers the costs of Japanese exporters and bolsters their earnings.Nintendo’s profit for the April-to-December period came to 14.55 billion yen, or $160 million, compared with a loss of 48.35 billion yen a year earlier, the company said in an earnings announcement that painted a mixed picture of its prospects.The company raised its profit forecast for the business year through March to 14 billion yen from 6 billion yen. Nintendo does not break out quarterly results."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/business/economy/fed-says-growth-has-paused-holds-steady-on-rates-and-strategy.html,"WASHINGTON — The Federal Reserve, noting that economic growth had “paused” in recent months, said Wednesday that it would continue its efforts to stimulate the economy for as long as it deemed necessary.The Fed attributed the pause in growth to the impact of Hurricane Sandy and other “transitory factors,” and it said that there were some signs of increased strength in areas including consumer spending and housing.It affirmed the stimulus program it announced in December, saying that it would hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent and expand its holdings of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities by $85 billion each month.“The committee expects that, with appropriate policy accommodation, economic growth will proceed at a moderate pace and the unemployment rate will gradually decline,” the central bank said in a statement released after the conclusion of a two-day meeting of its policy-making committee.The decision was supported by 11 of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee. Esther George, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, was the only dissenter, citing concerns about economic stability and inflation.The Fed announcement came hours after the government reported that economic growth was unexpectedly weak in the fourth quarter. The Commerce Department said that the economy contracted by 0.1 percent, the first decline since 2009.For the year, the economy grew by 2.2 percent – a decent pace in normal times, but not fast enough to help the millions of Americans still unable to find work.The central bank is trying to increase economic activity by holding down interest rates and reducing the availability of safe assets like Treasury bonds, pushing investors to take larger risks and reducing borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.Officials have pointed to increased sales of cars and homes as evidence that the policy is working, but they also have sought to temper expectations, warning in particular that monetary policy cannot offset reductions in government spending.Indeed, the unemployment rate has not declined since the Fed launched its latest round of purchases in September. The rate was 7.8 percent in December, the same as four months before. The government will report the rate for January on Friday.Fed officials also are wrestling with the potential costs of further expanding the central bank’s vast investment portfolio.Some critics warn that the Fed’s efforts will loosen its control over inflation, but those warnings so far have come to nothing. Inflation has actually fallen below the 2 percent annual pace that the Fed regards as healthy, leading some officials to argue the economy could use a little more inflation.Fed officials say that they are more concerned that asset purchases will destabilize financial markets, by removing safe assets from circulation, increasing the volatility of prices, or encouraging too much speculation.In December, the Fed said that it would purchase Treasuries at an initial pace of $45 billion a month, adding to the commitment it made in November to buy $40 billion a month in mortgage-backed securities.Mr. Bernanke underscored at a news conference following the announcement that the Fed might adjust the volume of purchases.“The committee intends to be flexible in varying the pace of securities purchases in response to information bearing on the outlook or on the perceived benefits and costs of the program,” Mr. Bernanke said then.At the time, some analysts saw evidence that the Fed already was contemplating the possibility that it was doing too much. That impression was reinforced by an account of the meeting released a few weeks later that said some officials wanted to reduce the pace of purchases by the summer.But it would be relatively easy for the Fed to do less. The more worrying possibility is that the economy might need additional help, forcing the Fed to consider whether it is able to do more – and whether it should."

Mr. Urdangarin and his main business partner, Diego Torres, as well as others involved in the sports and tourism events have denied wrongdoing.Mr. Urdangarin, a former professional handball player, became Duke of Palma in 1997 upon marrying Princess Cristina, the youngest daughter of the king. Investigators are seeking to determine if Mr. Urdangarin misused his royal credentials in securing contracts from regional authorities to organize sports events for children and other activities through his private Noós Institute and then siphoned off contract fees.Mr. Urdangarin has denied any link between his business activities and the rest of the royal family, and issued an apology last year for causing “serious damage” to the family. The royal household suspended him in late 2011 from attending official functions, declaring him persona non grata. He was removed from the royal family’s Web site this month.While the royal household has tried to distance itself from the case, the judge, José Castro, has extended his investigation and recently subpoenaed Carlos García Revenga, the personal secretary of the king’s daughters, Elena and Cristina. Mr. Revenga is expected to appear in court on Feb. 23, same day as Mr. Urdangarin."

They also searched several other offices that the doctor has in the area, according to a law enforcement official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was continuing. Dr. Melgen, 58, owns over a dozen Florida-registered companies.At the West Palm Beach office, agents from the F.B.I. were joined by the Office of the Inspector General of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, which investigates fraud in Medicare, Medicaid and other agency programs.At midmorning, investigators carried in a crowbar, and a locksmith arrived shortly after noon. A few hours later, they hauled away more than 30 cardboard boxes and placed them into the back of an unmarked van and into a white vehicle.Other than acknowledging that the F.B.I. was “conducting law enforcement activity” there, the agency declined to comment.“The government has not informed Dr. Melgen what its concerns are,” Lawrence Duffy, a lawyer for Dr. Melgen, said in a statement. “However, we are confident that Dr. Melgen has acted appropriately at all times.”Records show Dr. Melgen, who is best known for his association with Democratic politicians, including Senator Menendez, owes the Internal Revenue Service more than $10 million.The raid came just four days after a conservative Web site alleged that the F.B.I. was looking into accusations that Mr. Menendez and Dr. Melgen frequented under-age prostitutes in the Dominican Republic.The site included videos from alleged prostitutes and e-mail exchanges between an F.B.I. agent and a source in the Dominican Republic, who first referred the case to a nonprofit group in Washington.In a statement, the senator called the allegations involving prostitutes “false” and “manufactured by a politically-motivated right-wing blog.” The senator’s office said Wednesday night that Mr. Menendez had reimbursed Dr. Melgen $58,500 for two flights that he had taken aboard his private jet in 2010.The senator also called Dr. Melgen “a friend and political supporter.”Dr. Melgen told The New York Times last week, “I can assure you that all of the allegations are false.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/portland-bomb-plot-case-goes-to-jury.html,"PORTLAND, Ore. — Was hate speech by a young Somali-American who talked about the glories of jihad and the killing of American civilians the precursor to a life of violence and terror, or merely hot air from a confused and impressionable young man?That was the question posed to a federal jury here on Wednesday, as lawyers for the prosecution and the defense presented their final arguments in the closely watched case against Mohamed Osman Mohamud, 21, who is charged with attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction to bomb this city’s downtown at a Christmas tree lighting in November 2010. The bomb was not real; it was a replica constructed by the F.B.I. as part of an undercover operation.The devastating moment that might have been had the huge bomb been real barely registered mention in the final appeals to the jurors. Instead, the lawyers focused on the psychological path taken by Mr. Mohamud, a former college student who grew up mostly in Portland’s suburbs, that led to his pushing the detonator button on the night of the planned attack.Because Mr. Mohamud’s lawyers have claimed that he was entrapped and induced to commit the crime, the government has tried to to prove that he was on his course of action before he met the F.B.I. agents who posed as experienced international terrorists. That element of the case led both sides to focus on what Mr. Mohamud said and wrote in the months before the planned attack.“The seeds were sown,” said Assistant United States Attorney Ethan D. Knight. “This defendant was predisposed.”Long before Nov. 26, when upward of 25,000 people had gathered for the tree lighting and the truck carrying the device was parked, Mr. Knight told the jurors, Mr. Mohamud had “a substantive willingness to look to violence.”Mr. Mohamud’s lead lawyer, Stephen R. Sady, said the defendant’s discussions and writings about death and killing in the time leading up to the attack, while ugly, were not a crime. “He was a talker,” Mr. Sady said.The panel was sent out by Senior Judge Garr M. King of Federal District Court to begin deliberations late in the day, and immediately asked for exhibits to be sent in for examination. Mr. Mohamud faces up to life in prison if convicted of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction.In the summations, the jurors were asked by both sides to consider whether the defendant had been induced to commit a criminal act.Mr. Knight said the fact that the F.B.I. had built the bomb did not in itself mean that Mr. Mohamud was entrapped or manipulated. “Opportunity is not inducement,” the prosecutor said.He said Mr. Mohamud’s journals revealed a young man who was leading “a double life,” pretending to be a typical college student while concealing the attraction to a radical Islamic agenda that Mr. Knight said was clearly growing in his mind. Long before the night the plot fizzled and Mr. Mohamud was arrested, “the decision had already been made,” Mr. Knight said.Mr. Sady acknowledged that the journals included entries by Mr. Mohamud about not drawing attention to his radical beliefs, but the lawyer asked jurors to consider that many of the words were written after he had met the undercover agents. Those agents said in taped conversations that secrecy was vital.Evil can exist in all people, but the government pushed Mr. Mohamud to the course he took, Mr. Sady said.“You don’t put your thumb on the scale of evil,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/business/chrysler-earnings-soar.html,"DETROIT — Chrysler, the smallest of the American automakers, on Wednesday reported a big increase in 2012 earnings that helped its Italian parent company, Fiat, become profitable for the year as well.Chrysler said that its net income soared to $1.67 billion last year — about nine times as much as the $183 million it earned in 2011.The exponential increase underscored the company’s comeback from its government bailout and bankruptcy in 2009, when it was taken over by Fiat.In the fourth quarter alone, Chrysler said it earned $378 million, a 68 percent increase from $225 million in the same period in 2011. Revenue in the quarter was $17.2 billion, a 13 percent gain from $15.1 billion a year earlier.“Chrysler concluded a very successful 2012 with a robust fourth-quarter performance,” said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the auto research site TrueCar.com. “The company was the only domestic automaker to gain market share last year.”Chrysler also benefited from having little exposure to the deepening economic crisis in Europe, where vehicle sales have fallen to the lowest levels in nearly 20 years.The European problems, however, took a heavy toll on results at Fiat, which also reported earnings on Wednesday.Without Chrysler, Fiat said it would have lost 1.04 billion euros ($1.4 billion) in 2012. But instead, Chrysler’s results helped Fiat earn a profit of 1.41 billion euros for the year, about a 15 percent decrease from the 1.65 billion euros the Italian automaker earned in 2011, which included Chrysler after the middle of the year.In the fourth quarter, Fiat reported a profit of 388 million euros. Without Chrysler’s contributions, it would have lost 241 million euros.Analysts said Chrysler’s strong performance in the surging United States market should compensate for Fiat’s troubles for some time to come.“With Europe in the mess it is in, it’s going to be a tough slog for Fiat,” said Mike Wall, an analyst with the market-research firm IHS Automotive. “They need all the help Chrysler can give them.”Fiat currently owns a 58.5 percent stake in Chrysler, and has been consolidating the American company’s performance into its own results since June 2011.Chrysler has been growing steadily as it introduced new vehicles and revamped older models. Its revenue for 2012 was $65.8 billion, a 19.6 percent improvement from $55 billion the previous year.For the year, its global vehicle sales increased to 2.2 million, an 18 percent increase from 1.9 million the previous year, and its market share in the United States improved to 11.2 percent, up from 10.5 percent a year earlier.Sergio Marchionne, who serves as chief executive of both Chrysler and Fiat, said the turnaround at Chrysler was gaining momentum thanks to solid sales of core products like the Ram pickup and the Jeep Grand Cherokee S.U.V.“We pause for a moment to enjoy our accomplishments,” Mr. Marchionne said, “but we will not stop.”Mr. Marchionne forecast continued improvement for Chrysler this year. He said the company expected to earn net income of $2.2 billion in 2013, on revenue of $72 billion or higher.He also outlined plans on Wednesday to bring more Fiat and Alfa Romeo models to the United States, even as Chrysler delays the introduction of some of its own new products.The Alfa Romeo brand, which left the American market almost 20 years ago, will return with a sports car later this year. It is the first of several new Alfas destined for the United States over the next three years.Fiat will also add several new products for the American market, building on its first offering, the tiny Fiat 500 microcar.Mr. Marchionne said that a few Chrysler car models, mostly derived from Fiat platforms, would be delayed as a result.“The product plan is a living document,” he said, referring to changes in Chrysler’s vehicle timetable. “And we continue to rework that document.”Mr. Marchionne also said plans were fluid regarding an initial public offering of Chrysler stock. A health care trust for retired members of the United Automobile Workers union is seeking an I.P.O. to cash out its 41.5 percent ownership stake in Chrysler.Chrysler’s large profits in 2012 will directly benefit its current hourly work force. About 31,000 union members will receive average profit-sharing checks of $2,250, the company said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/us/officials-back-deep-cuts-in-atlantic-cod-harvest-to-save-industry.html,"PORTSMOUTH, N.H. — Fishery management officials meeting here on Wednesday voted to impose drastic new cuts to the commercial harvest of cod along the Atlantic coast, arguing that the only way to save the centuries-old cod fishing industry was to sharply limit it.In the 1600s, the lowly cod was so abundant in the cold North Atlantic waters that, along with boatbuilding and timbering, it provided the foundation of the New England economy. In the 1700s, a “sacred cod” was bestowed on the State House in Massachusetts, where it hangs to this day as a symbol of the importance of cod fishing to the region.But over recent decades, the once bountiful cod has been so depleted that government officials now say that it stands on the verge of extinction.At a grim daylong session here, a deeply divided New England Fishery Management Council voted to recommend reductions of 77 percent from last year’s catch for each of the next three years for cod in the Gulf of Maine.It also recommended cuts of 61 percent from last year for one year only to the cod catch on Georges Bank, a vast area off Cape Cod, which was named for the fish. The council’s recommendations are subject to approval by the federal government, which is expected to put them in place by May 1.“We are headed, slowly, seeming inexorably, to oblivion,” said John Bullard, the regional administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and a member of the council, as he explained his support for the catch limits. “I do not deny the costs that are going to be paid by fishermen, families, communities. They are real. They will hurt.”The problem, he said, is not government inflexibility, as fishermen have suggested, but the lack of fish. “It’s midnight and getting darker when it comes to how many cod there are,” he said. “There isn’t enough cod for people to make a decent living.”But opponents said the limits would not help save the industry.“Right now what we’ve got is a plan that guarantees the fishermen’s extinction and does nothing to ameliorate it,” David Goethel, a New Hampshire-based fisherman and biologist, said as he cast his vote against the plan.Fishermen were furious with the result.“I’m leaving here in a coffin,” said Carlos Rafael, who owns a commercial fishing business in New Bedford, Mass. “With all these cuts, I won’t be able to keep half of my fleet working. I’ll have to cut down from 20 groundfish boats to maybe 5or 6.”Before the vote, fishermen had crowded into the meeting room, many pleading that the limits not be set so low.“We have done everything that has been asked of us,” said Paul Vitale, who fishes commercially in Gloucester, Mass. “I don’t want to go anywhere else for work, as demented as that sounds.”The plan reduces the catch of cod in the Gulf of Maine down to 1,550 metric tons a year for the next three years; the limit was 8,000 metric tons a decade ago. The catch in Georges Bank would drop to 2,002 metric tons, down from 12,000 from a decade ago. “They’re huge, there’s no other way to describe it,” said Tom Nies, a fishery analyst for the council.At its last peak in 2001, Mr. Nies said, the industry made about $100 million. It made about $80 million last year. The new limits could cut the size of the industry for this year to about $55 million, for a loss of $25 million. But fishermen said the true impact of the cuts would go much deeper. “It’s 80 percent of a really small number to begin with,” Mr. Goethe said. He said the actual loss to the industry would be more like $60 million. “When you get down to cuts that small, there’s simply no place to go,” he said.Frank Mirarchi, a fisherman from Scituate, Mass., who primarily pursues groundfish, said that the proposed limits would deprive him of his living and that the cuts would ripple up and down the coast.“This whole economy in this region is a really small microbusiness economy,” Mr. Mirarchi said. “The fuel guy, the ice guy, the guy that drives the fish truck from the landing port to the processing center, fish cutters — a job here, a job there,” he said. “It’s not like closing a big factory. It’s little jobs on nondescript piers that just kind of disappear and nobody notices.”The limits come after years of what many scientists, managers and fishermen alike have said was mismanagement based on inconsistent or overly optimistic estimates of where fish stocks were, and how they could be rebuilt.“I think the reality is that our understanding of where the stock is has changed,” Mr. Nies said. “We last assessed these stocks back in 2008 and we thought they were growing quite well, and so the quotas were going up. And then when we assessed them this year, we find out that they in fact have not grown as we expected.”The United States has watched the near total collapse of cod stocks in Canada. The demise of the fish populations was hastened by the widespread use of big trawlers equipped with radar and sonar systems that enhanced the ability to catch the fish. They expanded the area and depths that could be fished and sped up the process, diminishing the ability of the remaining fish stocks to replenish themselves.The big trawlers also swept up other fish that had little commercial value but played important predator-prey roles in maintaining the ecological balance of the species. Today the cod stock in the Gulf of Maine is at 18 percent of what scientists deem to be a healthy population; in Georges Bank, it is 7 percent.While previous quota reductions have hurt fishermen, environmental advocates and even fishermen have said that, despite high groundfish prices, they are not landing their full quotas.“We’re looking at landings that are the worst on record,” said Tom Dempsey, a fisherman and council member who voted for the cuts. “The problem with Georges Bank codfish is that it is a resource that is on the verge of collapse. It scares the hell out of a whole lot of people who build their business on Georges Bank codfish.”According to NOAA’s Northeast Regional Office, fishermen have caught less than 30 percent of the 2012 allotment of Georges Bank cod to date and only slightly more than half of the allowable catch for the Gulf of Maine.But some fishermen and environmentalists said that overfishing was not the only reason for the paucity of cod, with some putting part of the blame on climate change.“We’re seeing a distinct ecosystem change,” Mr. Mirarchi said. “The water’s warmer. We’re seeing species that normally never come into the north lingering into the fall. Something else is going on besides just fishing.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/opinion/wal-marts-modest-steps-on-fire-safety.html,"Wal-Mart Stores last week adopted a “zero tolerance” policy for weak fire safety standards at foreign factories that make clothes sold by the company. The new policy, following a devastating fire in November that killed 112 workers at a Bangladesh factory, includes some positive changes like periodic safety audits, but it does not go far enough in imposing strict standards or in helping factory owners pay for improvements to protect laborers. Wal-Mart buys more than $1 billion in garments a year from Bangladesh alone, accounting for more than 5 percent of the country’s $19 billion in clothing exports. That gives it the power to demand reforms as well as the duty to ensure that they are carried out. The company says it will require all suppliers to disclose every factory they use and will cut them off if they use plants that do not meet updated standards, like having unobstructed exits that are not barred or locked and routine safety training and fire drills.But Wal-Mart needs to do much more. It should require fireproof exits or external fire escapes, which are the most effective way to get people out of a burning building safely. The company also needs to make some financial commitments. So far, it has not promised to help pay for improvements or offer higher prices for the clothes it buys to make it possible for factory owners to renovate. A Wal-Mart spokeswoman said that it is considering providing loans to suppliers, but that won’t help much unless those vendors make enough money to repay those debts.Wal-Mart and other Western companies have tried voluntary auditing and inspections to keep vendors honest about workplace conditions. But recent fires in Bangladesh, including one last weekend that killed seven women, show that this approach is not working.What’s needed is an independent and robust inspection system that is legally enforceable and run by safety professionals. In an ideal world, that responsibility would fall to governments, but it’s unrealistic to expect developing countries like Bangladesh to build that capacity quickly. That is why major multinational clothing retailers need to take the lead."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/food-companies-meet-to-weigh-federal-label-for-gene-engineered-ingredients.html,"With Washington State on the verge of a ballot initiative that would require labeling of some foods containing genetically engineered ingredients and other states considering similar measures, some of the major food companies and Wal-Mart, the country’s largest grocery store operator, have been discussing lobbying for a national labeling program.Executives from PepsiCo, ConAgra and about 20 other major food companies, as well as Wal-Mart and advocacy groups that favor labeling, attended a meeting in January in Washington convened by the Meridian Institute, which organizes discussions of major issues. The inclusion of Wal-Mart has buoyed hopes among labeling advocates that the big food companies will shift away from tactics like those used to defeat Proposition 37 in California last fall, when corporations spent more than $40 million to oppose the labeling of genetically modified foods.“They spent an awful lot of money in California — talk about a lack of return on investment,” said Gary Hirshberg, co-chairman of the Just Label It campaign, which advocates national labeling, and chairman of Stonyfield, an organic dairy company.Instead of quelling the demand for labeling, the defeat of the California measure has spawned a ballot initiative in Washington State and legislative proposals in Connecticut, Vermont, New Mexico and Missouri, and a swelling consumer boycott of some organic or “natural” brands owned by major food companies.Mr. Hirshberg, who attended the January meeting, said he knew of roughly 20 states considering labeling requirements.“The big food companies found themselves in an uncomfortable position after Prop. 37, and they’re talking among themselves about alternatives to merely replaying that fight over and over again,” said Charles Benbrook, a research professor at Washington State University who attended the meeting.“They spent a lot of money, got a lot of bad press that propelled the issue into the national debate and alienated some of their customer base, as well as raising issues with some trading partners,” said Mr. Benbrook, who does work on sustainable agriculture.For more than a decade, almost all processed foods in the United States — like cereals, snacks and salad dressings — have contained ingredients from plants with DNA that has been manipulated in a laboratory. The Food and Drug Administration, other regulators and many scientists say these foods pose no danger. But as Americans ask more pointed questions about what they are eating, popular suspicions about the health and environmental effects of biotechnology are fueling a movement to require that food from genetically modified crops be labeled, if not eliminated.Impending F.D.A. approval of a genetically modified salmon and the Agriculture Department’s consideration of genetically engineered apples have further intensified the debate.“We’re at a point where, this summer, families could be sitting at their tables and wondering whether the salmon and sweet corn they’re about to eat has been genetically modified,” said Trudy Bialic, director of public affairs at PCC Natural Markets in Seattle. “The fish has really accelerated concerns.”Mr. Hirshberg said some company representatives wanted to find ways to persuade the Food and Drug Administration to proceed with federal labeling.“The F.D.A. is not only employing 20-year-old, and we think obsolete, standards for materiality, but there is a general tendency on the part of the F.D.A. to be resistant to change,” he said. “With an issue as polarized and politicized as this one, it’s going to take a broad-based coalition to crack through that barrier.”Morgan Liscinsky, an F.D.A. spokeswoman, said the agency considered the “totality of all the data and relevant information” when forming policy guidance. “We’ve continued to evaluate data as it has become available over the last 20 years,” she said.Neither Mr. Hirshberg nor Mr. Benbrook would identify other companies that participated in the talks, but others confirmed some of the companies represented. Caroline Starke, who represents the Meridian Institute, said she could not comment on a specific meeting or participants.Proponents of labeling in Washington State have taken a somewhat different tack from those in California, arguing that the failure to label will hurt the state’s fisheries and apple and wheat farms. “It’s a bigger issue than just the right to know,” Ms. Bialic said. “It reaches deep into our state’s economy because of the impact this is going to have on international trade.”A third of the apples grown in Washington State are exported, many of them to markets for high-value products around the Pacific Rim, where many countries require labeling. Apple, fish and wheat farmers in Washington State worry that those countries and others among the 62 nations that require some labeling of genetically modified foods will be much more wary of whole foods than of processed goods.The Washington measure would not apply to meat or dairy products from animals fed genetically engineered feed, and it sharply limits the ability to collect damages for mislabeling.Mr. Benbrook and consumer advocates say the federal agencies responsible for things like labeling have relied on research financed by companies that make genetically modified seeds.“If there is a documented issue with this overseas, it could have a devastating impact on the U.S. food system and agriculture,” Mr. Benbrook said. “The F.D.A. isn’t going to get very far with international governments by saying Monsanto and Syngenta told us these foods are safe and we believed them.”Advocacy groups also have denounced the appointment of Michael R. Taylor, a former executive at Monsanto, as the F.D.A.’s deputy commissioner for food and veterinary medicine.Ms. Liscinsky of the F.D.A. said Mr. Taylor was recused from issues involving biotechnology.What has excited proponents of labeling most is Wal-Mart’s participation in the meeting. The retailer came under fire from consumer advocates last summer for its decision to sell a variety of genetically engineered sweet corn created by Monsanto.Because Wal-Mart is the largest grocery retailer, a move by the company to require suppliers to label products could be influential in developing a national labeling program.“I can remember when the British retail federation got behind labeling there, that was when things really started to happen there,” said Ronnie Cummins, founder and national director of the Organic Consumers Association. “If Wal-Mart is at the table, that’s a big deal.”Brands like Honest Tea, which is owned by Coca-Cola, have written to the association, which estimates 75 percent of grocery products contain a genetically modified ingredient, to protest its “Traitors Boycott,” which urges consumers not to buy products made by units of companies that fought Proposition 37. Consumers have peppered the companies’ Web sites, Facebook pages and Twitter streams with angry remarks.Ben & Jerry’s, the ice cream company, announced recently that it would remove all genetically modified ingredients from its products by the end of this year. Consumers had expressed outrage over the money its parent, Unilever, contributed to defeat the California measure.The state Legislature in Vermont, where Ben & Jerry’s is based, is considering a law that would require labeling, as is the General Assembly in Connecticut. Legislators in New Mexico have proposed an amendment to the state’s food law that would require companies to label genetically modified products.And this month, a senator in Missouri, home of Monsanto, one of the biggest producers of genetically modified seeds, proposed legislation that would require the labeling of genetically engineered meat and fish.“I don’t want to hinder any producer of genetically modified goods,” the senator, Jamilah Nasheed, who represents St. Louis, said in a news release. “However, I strongly feel that people have the right to know what they are putting into their bodies.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/technology/ericsson-sales-rise-on-spending-to-upgrade-mobile-networks.html,"BERLIN — Ericsson, the world’s biggest maker of mobile telephone network equipment, said Thursday that its sales and profit grew faster than expected in the fourth quarter as phone operators in the United States and Canada spent heavily to upgrade wireless networks.The company booked a net loss during the quarter as it wrote down the value of ST-Ericsson, an unprofitable smartphone component venture with the French chip maker ST Microelectronics.But investors apparently looked past that to focus on the underlying growth. Shares of Ericsson, based in Stockholm, rose almost 10 percent after the earnings report, which showed that demand from North America had helped lift Ericsson’s global sales of network equipment, the company’s main business, by 6 percent from a year earlier.Ericsson’s sales of equipment, software and services in the three months through December rose 5 percent to 66.9 billion kronor, or $10.5 billion.“This suggests the declining sales of network equipment we have seen for some time has finally begun to turn around,” said Hakan Wranne, an analyst at Swedbank in Stockholm.In North America, Ericsson said sales of mobile broadband and other network gear to U.S. and Canadian operators surged 86 percent to 9.4 billion kronor in the quarter from a year earlier, without providing a comparative figure. Sales of equipment rose 10 percent in Western Europe and 38 percent in India.The increase followed four quarters of declining global network sales.“We continue to believe the long-term fundamentals of this industry are attractive,” said Hans Vestberg, the Ericsson chief executive. “I think it is clear that society will be using mobile broadband and the cloud much more than they are now.”Ericsson said it took a charge of 8.6 billion kronor against earnings in the period for ST-Ericsson, which is based in Geneva and has generated about $2.8 billion in losses since February 2009. The charge caused Ericsson to report a loss of 6.3 billion kronor for the fourth quarter.Ericsson had warned investors of the charge on Dec. 20.ST-Ericsson employs 5,090 workers and makes processor modules and modems for some Samsung, Motorola and Sony smartphones.Mr. Vestberg said he had no new information on the future of ST-Ericsson, which reported a $71 million loss in the quarter on unchanged sales of $358 million. Last month, STMicroelectronics announced plans to leave the venture, and Ericsson said it had no intention of buying its partner’s stake.“We continue to believe that the modern technology in this venture is of strategic importance to the industry,” Mr. Vestberg said. “We are now in a discussion among the shareholders about our options going forward. We don’t exclude anything at this point.”Mr. Wranne, the Swedbank analyst, said he thought it was possible that Ericsson might simply resort to shutting down the joint venture sometime this year.“Both parents have essentially turned their back on the company, and what I think they have done is essentially killed it,” Mr. Wranne said. “At this point, it is not certain whether the venture will be operating six months from now.”With the charge against earnings, Ericsson has written off the entire value of its investment in ST-Ericsson, said Jan Frykhammar, the Ericsson chief financial officer. The business began to deteriorate after Nokia, its biggest client, announced plans in 2011 to halt its Symbian smartphone line, which had used many ST-Ericsson components.Ericsson’s main network equipment business, which made up 53 percent of its sales in the quarter, more than made up for the ST-Ericsson write-off. Sales of Ericsson’s equipment, software and services in North America rose 51 percent to 17 billion kronor.Excluding the ST-Ericsson charges, Ericsson’s operating profit in the quarter rose by 17 percent to 4.8 billion kronor.Sales in the quarter rose on an annual basis in all regions except Scandinavia, the Mediterranean region of southern Europe, China, the Middle East and Latin America.The gains are a harbinger a new phase of purchasing by global phone operators, Mr. Vestberg said, as they compete to sell mobile broadband services to the rapidly expanding ranks of smartphone users. Ericsson expects the number of mobile broadband users around the world to rise 40 percent to 2.1 billion by the end of this year from 1.5 billion in 2012.By the end of this year, 3 in 10 cellphone users around the world will be operating smartphones and subscribing to mobile broadband service, Ericsson predicted. Demand for fast wireless Internet will in turn lift demand for Ericsson’s networks, Mr. Vestberg said. In the past quarter, he said, 40 percent of all cellphones sold worldwide were smartphones.Operators, recognizing the strong consumer interest in mobile broadband, are stepping up their orders for new data networks that can handle the heavy traffic demands on their grids.“Operators and customers are focusing now on mobile broadband,” Mr. Vestberg said. “We are clearly seeing a change in their behavior.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/global/powering-the-philippine-economy-with-elvis-and-zeppelin.html,"MANILA — For more than 30 years, Josetoni Tonnette Acaylar has been singing and playing the piano throughout Asia.He has provided relaxing background music and taken requests for pop and jazz standards in more five-star hotel lobbies and smoky lounges than he can recall, in Brunei, China, Dubai, Hong Kong and other locales.In one job in Japan, he was told to take off his tuxedo and work in the kitchen, washing dishes and scrubbing floors. “Sometimes they would pull me out of the kitchen, give me a jacket and yell, ‘Play the piano!’ and I would have to perform,” Mr. Acaylar recalled with a laugh.Mr. Acaylar is just one of the thousands of musicians from the Philippines who are prominent in bars, lounges and clubs around Asia and the Middle East. But the band used to be much bigger.In 2002 alone, more than 40,000 entertainers left the Philippines to work overseas, primarily in Japan. After allegations of prostitution among some entertainers, however, the Japanese government found that many of the female musicians could not actually play a musical instrument, and that many of the vocalists did not have much of a voice.After the crackdown, the number of performers who left the Philippines to work overseas dropped to 4,050 in 2006, from 43,818 in 2004. The figure now hovers around 1,500 to 2,000 a year, government statistics show, with Japan remaining the top destination, followed by Malaysia, South Korea and China.“We only allow musicians and entertainers to work in legitimate establishments such as cruise ships and major hotels,” said Yolanda E. Paragua, a senior official with the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration. “Not in honky-tonk type places.”The musicians are among the millions of people from the Philippines who work overseas and help power the country’s economy with remittances. And the Philippine economy is indeed thriving: in 2012, gross domestic product grew 6.6 percent, surpassing the government’s forecast for growth of 5 percent to 6 percent, data released Thursday showed. The country had the second-highest growth rate in the world in 2012, after China, according to Reuters.Government expenditure in the Philippines jumped nearly 12 percent in 2012, while private spending, which was bolstered by remittances from abroad, was up 6.1 percent, Reuters reported.In the past, the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration held auditions to verify the legitimacy of musicians seeking to work overseas, said Celso J. Hernandez, the head of the agency’s operations and surveillance division.After the Japanese crackdown, however, the Philippine government discontinued the practice. These days, the government relies on vetting by licensed recruitment agencies, although it still examines the musicians’ paperwork.The Philippines has a rich music scene, with bands playing hard rock, reggae, jazz, blues and nearly every other form of music each night in numerous clubs around the country. Musicians in the country, as elsewhere, often dream of writing their own works, signing a deal with a major recording label and achieving fame and fortune. But many of those who do not succeed on that path can still find regular work overseas.Domingo Mercado Jr., who goes by the stage name Jojo, wrote and performed original music when he left high school, as part of a nine-piece band called Music and Imagination. Some of his friends have had a taste of fame, but he went in another direction.“I resigned from the band and took a job in Korea,” said Mr. Mercado, 45. “I gave up on my dream.”Mr. Mercado has performed across Asia as a singer and guitarist since 1994. He recently returned from a six-month job on a cruise ship.Although singers and musicians from the Philippines can be found performing in many hotel lounges around Asia, the field is actually quite specialized and highly competitive. “A hotel might need many waiters, cooks and housekeepers,” Mr. Hernandez of the overseas employment agency said. “But they only need one or two musicians.”According to the employment agency, about 1.6 million people left the Philippines in 2011 to work overseas. About 369,000 of them went to work on ships, with the remainder employed in a range of fields, including as nurses, waiters, welders, plumbers and caregivers.But the sector that draws the most people from the Philippines overseas is, by far, household services. In 2011, 142,486 people left the country to work as domestic helpers. Nurses made up the second-largest group, at 17,198.The Middle East draws the largest number of workers from the Philippines, with Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates as the top two destinations. But there is no guarantee of what awaits employees at any destination. “We experience a lot of problems with domestic workers going overseas, particularly to the Middle East,” Mrs. Paragua said. “They are vulnerable to exploitation.”The Philippine government began helping workers go abroad as a stopgap measure to address high unemployment in the 1970s. Today, it continues to say that the phenomenon is a temporary one. “We are not promoting overseas employment. We are managing it,” Mrs. Paragua said. “It would be best if workers could just stay here and earn a good salary.”The robust growth in the Philippines last year has not translated into significant job growth, according to government figures released Thursday. Unemployment was at 6.8 percent in October, up from 6.4 percent a year earlier, and the number of unemployed in the country rose to 2.76 million from 2.64 million.A person with a relatively basic education who comes from a rural area in the Philippines can earn the equivalent of about $400 a month, plus room and board, working overseas as a domestic helper. That amounts to a comfortable income in the Philippines that could put several children through private schooling in a rural part of the country.Musicians, meanwhile, can make as much as $2,000 a month working in five-star hotels, or $800 to $1,500 a month working on a cruise ship, according to performers and government officials. But they are also vulnerable to exploitation, Mrs. Paragua said, and some earn $400 per month.The money sent home by overseas workers is an important driver of economic growth in the Philippines. According to a report released by the central bank on Dec. 17, remittances from overseas reached $17.5 billion between January and October of 2012, up 5.8 percent from the year-earlier period.The movement of workers from the Philippines is not driven merely by unemployment in the country, however, and thus by a large supply of applicants. “There is a strong demand for Filipino workers,” Mrs. Paragua said. Employees from the country generally have a good command of English and a comparatively high level of education, and they have a reputation for maintaining good work relationships with their employers.Musicians from the Philippines are also in demand, said Maria Victoria Kinpanar, a booking agent. But she noted that the improved economy in the Philippines had created some lucrative options for musicians who wanted to stay or return home.“Overseas work is short-term contract work. It’s not stable,” Ms. Kinpanar said. “Some high-quality musicians are now able to find long-term work here in the Philippines.”Indeed, after spending 30 years working across Asia, Mr. Acaylar now has a regular job playing the piano in the lounge of the Hyatt Hotel & Casino in Manila. But he is still uncomfortable with the suggestion that he is a traveling lounge musician.“I don’t categorize myself as a lounge singer or lobby pianist,” he said. “That requires formal training. I just play the piano and sing songs.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/ups-posts-a-loss-and-forecasts-lower-profit.html,"United Parcel Service reported a fourth-quarter net loss on Thursday after taking a large pension-related charge and forecast weaker-than-expected profit for 2013 because of an uneven global economy.U.P.S. followed a stream of other big companies like Rockwell Automation and Northrop Grumman that were also weighed down by pension-related charges. A prolonged period of low interest rates is driving up companies’ pension costs.Even factoring out the $3 billion noncash pension charge, U.P.S., the world’s largest package-delivery company, reported a fourth-quarter profit that still missed Wall Street’s expectations.U.P.S. said it faced a $225 million rise in pension costs this year.“This will be a significant drag in 2013,” the chief financial officer, Kurt Kuehn, told investors in a conference call.The company expects earnings to rise 6 to 12 percent in 2013, from $4.80 to $5.06 a share, below the average Wall Street target of $5.11.“It’s going to come down to worldwide economic growth,” said Helane Becker, a Dahlman Rose analyst.U.P.S. posted a fourth-quarter net loss of $1.75 billion, or $1.83 a share, after the pension charge, in contrast to a net profit of $725 million, or 74 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.Revenue rose 2.9 percent, to $14.57 billion from $14.17 billion. U.P.S. said costs related to Hurricane Sandy, which pounded the New York metropolitan area in late October, sliced profit by 5 cents a share in the quarter.Factoring out one-time, noncash items, profit came to $1.32 a share, below the analysts’ average estimate of $1.38, according to Thomson Reuters.“We remain in a cycle of mixed growth and mixed signals,” the chief executive, D. Scott Davis, told investors in the conference call. “Fiscal uncertainty continues to erode business confidence and growth prospects.”A Morningstar analyst, Keith Schoonmaker, said one good sign in the quarter was the 7.7 percent rise in next-day air shipments in the United States.“We need to cut through the pension clutter and look at economic results,” Mr. Schoonmaker said. “This is a company that has tremendous operating capability, so when you feed them a little bit more volume into their system, this company is able to make hay with that.”U.P.S.’s largest American rival, FedEx, has been struggling with falling profits as customers increasingly send goods by ground, which is less costly and less profitable than by air."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/technology/stmicroelectronics-may-pay-500-million-to-exit-venture.html,"PARIS — STMicroelectronics, the biggest European chip maker, may have to spend up to $500 million this year to wind down the mobile chip-making joint venture with Ericsson that has been a ball-and-chain on its results, the company’s chief executive said Thursday.“We’re committed to going fast,” Carlo Bozotti, the chief executive, said during a briefing in Paris. “It’s important for us to move on, to become a leaner company.”Mr. Bozotti also said he had seen “encouraging signs” that the semiconductor market was improving this year after a rocky 2012, but “we’ll have to see if that’s sustainable.”Shares of STMicroelectronics closed up 3.5 percent in Paris trading. Analysts said positive outlooks issued by STMicroelectronics and the company’s German rival, Infineon Technologies, helped lift the stock price.STMicroelectronics, an Italian-French company with its headquarters in Geneva, and the Swedish mobile networking giant Ericsson bet big on chips to power smartphones. But their joint venture, ST-Ericsson, foundered as big customers like Nokia and BlackBerry were smashed by competition from Apple and Samsung, which rely heavily on chips made by Qualcomm. The venture has lost about $2.8 billion since 2009.Negotiations to sell or close down the company, which employs more than 5,000 people, will be a delicate matter. Complicating any deal, at a time of economic stagnation and fears for the future of European industry, is the fact that the French and Italian governments own a combined 27.5 percent stake in STMicroelectronics. At any rate, a near-term closure of the company is thought to be unlikely, as ST-Ericsson has long-term supplier contracts it has promised to fulfill.Mr. Bozotti said STMicroelectronics expected to dispose of its ST-Ericsson stake “during the third quarter of 2013,” though he gave no indication of how the company planned to do so. The cost would probably be in the range of $300 million to $500 million, he said, “including around $100 million in the first quarter.”STMicroelectronics is one of the biggest high-technology enterprises in Europe and an industry leader in areas with strong growth prospects, like sensors and microcontrollers. Its chip-making and research and development facilities around Grenoble are at the heart of the innovation cluster that serves as France’s answer to Silicon Valley.Mr. Bozotti spoke after STMicroelectronics announced late Wednesday a $544 million write-down of good will and other intangible assets on its share of ST-Ericsson, a charge that reduced the accounting value of the 50-50 joint venture to “a negligible amount” on its books. The charge led the company’s fourth-quarter net loss to balloon to $428 million from an $11 million loss a year earlier.STMicroelectronics said its full-year 2012 revenue slid nearly 13 percent, to $8.5 billion, largely because sales to Nokia fell. Just four years ago, the Finnish cellphone maker accounted for about a fifth of all its sales; STMicroelectronics did not disclose the current level but acknowledged that it was far lower.The bottom line was “horrible,” Thomas Becker, an electronics sector analyst at Commerzbank, said of the results, “but the underlying numbers were not that bad.”He said that shares of STMicroelectronics and Infineon — which forecast a rise in second-quarter sales and operating profit on Thursday — got a lift “because some investors may be hoping to get in on the upswing in the semiconductor cycle.”The company is refocusing its business, Mr. Bozotti said, and expects growth in 2013 to be driven primarily by sales of devices in its imaging, analog and microsensor, and microcontroller businesses. He said STMicroelectronics would cut its quarterly costs to $600 million to $650 million by 2014, from around $900 million currently."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/court-case-offers-a-peek-into-mortgage-security-pricing.html,"The private mortgage-backed securities market grew to be a virtually inscrutable giant. Each securitization contained thousands of mortgages and as many as dozens of different securities, some of which could emerge unscathed even if others produced total losses for investors.Five years after it began to blow up, that market can be seen as having failed twice — once before the housing crisis began and again when the crisis was at its peak. Investors put money into deals that never should have been financed, then panicked when the credit crisis arrived and dumped securities that really were likely to pay off. A market that had been full of foolish buyers had no buyers. The banks loudly proclaimed that prices were irrationally low, but few if any of them were willing to buy.It was the government that stepped in and saved the market, in a program — called PPIP, for Legacy Securities Public-Private Investment Program — that has turned out to be a success. The government put up most of the money to enable money managers to buy distressed merchandise. This week the Treasury Department reported that it had recovered all of the money it invested, with much more likely to come.That report came a couple of days after the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission filed criminal and civil charges against a former securities salesman who was accused of defrauding the institutional investors who invested their own and the government’s money in PPIP. He did that, the government said, by lying to them.Mortgage-backed securities “are generally illiquid and discovering a market price for them is difficult,” the S.E.C. said in its civil case against the broker, Jesse Litvak, who formerly worked for Jefferies & Company. “Participants trading in the M.B.S. market must rely on informal sources, including their broker, for this information.”How, I wondered, can that be? The corporate bond market used to be like that. But after Arthur Levitt, the S.E.C. chairman in the 1990s, complained, steps were taken to rectify the situation. Now you can learn from the Trace system operated by Finra, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, about trades in any bond.But no one at Finra seems to have given the mortgage-backed securities market even a moment’s worth of attention until 2009, when the market crashed. Even then, it was not until 2011 that Finra began to require brokers to submit every trade. Now if the S.E.C. wants to see every trade in a particular security, it can do so.But you and I cannot.Starting in July, more information about trading in mortgage securities guaranteed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac will become available, which is good but not nearly as important. We already have a pretty good idea of how those securities trade. But private-label securities — backed only by the mortgages in each securitization — are different from one another, and it is not as easy to estimate the value of one based on trading in a different one.Had trading data on such securities been public, institutional investors such as the ones that the government claims were defrauded would have been able to see the trades Jefferies made when it acquired the bonds it marked up and sold to them. Any lies, like those Mr. Litvak is accused of telling, would have been unmasked immediately.The Dodd-Frank law, by the way, requires more disclosure of trades in all kinds of swaps, including swaps based on mortgage-backed securities, and those disclosures are starting to appear as the Commodity Futures Trading Commission writes rules. But that law completely ignored the mortgage-backed securities themselves, so trading in them remains secret.Now that the S.E.C. and the Justice Department have officially asserted that investors in such securities are at the mercy of their brokers, perhaps they will press Finra to require release of the information.Doing so would be almost costless, since the data is already being gathered.But such a move would be fiercely resisted both by Wall Street and by some of the institutional investors that would be protected. The brokers’ opposition is easy to understand: profit margins always fall when the customers have better information. The brokers have also persuaded some money managers to oppose release, on the ground that their strategies would be revealed if everyone could see that there was more activity in a particular type of security.“We have not made a final determination of what we should put out that would be helpful for market participants in these private-label securities,” Steven Joachim, Finra’s executive vice president for transparency services, told me this week. He said there was no timetable on when any decision would be made.Perhaps more public information about the mortgage-backed securities market might have prevented the market’s second failure.By the time the market crashed in 2009, there was plenty of information available about specific issues — about the mortgages behind them and about how rapidly defaults were mounting. Analyzing that information was not easy, and many of the traditional players in that market — the banks — were short of capital anyway.The interesting question is whether easily available information about price and volume of individual securities would have led hedge funds and other sources of private capital to seek out relative bargains, and thus bring support to the market.As it was, the market was in chaos until Uncle Sam stepped in. PPIP provided capital to nine money managers, which put up 25 cents in capital for every 75 cents the government put up. Half the government capital was treated as debt, meaning it would be paid back before the fund manager got anything. No additional leverage was allowed, giving those funds the ability to hang tough if securities they bought continued to lose value. There would be no margin calls.It worked. The managers followed differing strategies, some buying quickly and some slowly, some focusing on residential mortgage-backed securities — the type that Mr. Litvak was selling — and some on commercial securities. All of them seem to have made good money. Over all, the government put up $18.6 billion, has gotten back $18.8 billion and seems likely to get at least another $3 billion.“The program helped to stabilize and restart markets that froze up during the crisis,” said Timothy G. Massad, the Treasury Department’s assistant secretary for financial stability. Now the program is being wound down, and most of the securities have been sold.The civil and criminal charges against Mr. Litvak provide insight into prices in some securities during the crisis. With that list in hand I was able to get the prices that one service advises its clients the securities are worth now. All have recovered some value, even though the news in some cases has continued to be bad.One example of how a mortgage securitization could have been a horrid one — and still work out O.K. for those who bought in 2009 — was a security known as INDX 2007-AR7 2A1.Here’s the bad news: It was backed by mortgages written by IndyMac Bank, a California institution whose 2008 failure cost the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation more than any other. Most of the loans required no principal repayments for five years and were made to borrowers whose income no one bothered to check. (In some cases, the bank did not even ask how much the borrower made.) The loans were concentrated in California, but there were also sizable blocks in Arizona and Florida — all areas where home values fell sharply. Defaults and foreclosures have been plentiful.On the other hand, these were “supersenior” securities that had been rated AAA when issued, in part because more junior securities would take the first losses. While the senior securities have now taken some losses, and are likely to take more, they are not going to become worthless. The current estimated value is around 66 percent of par value, far above the price of 42.25 percent that Mr. Litvak’s client paid in May 2009. The government claims that Mr. Litvak bought the security for 41.13 percent but lied to the customer by saying he actually paid a full percentage point more. Mr. Litvak’s lawyer says he did nothing wrong.It will be interesting to see if the government can persuade a judge and jury that, in the words of George Canellos, the deputy enforcement director at the S.E.C., “Brokers must always tell their customers the truth, particularly in complex securities transactions in which it is difficult for investors to determine market prices on their own.” It will also be interesting to see if the commission forces Wall Street to disclose those market prices."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/politics/extension-of-debt-limit-clears-congress.html,"WASHINGTON — The Senate gave final approval on Thursday to legislation suspending the statutory debt ceiling until May, officially turning Congress’s attention to the next budget showdown: $1 trillion in across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts set to begin on March 1.The 64-to-34 vote ended for now a clash that had threatened the full faith and credit of the United States government. But the next budget fight is just four weeks away. House Republican leaders insist that the across-the-board cuts, known as sequestration, are coming, even as senators in both parties scramble for short- and long-term remedies.Senate Democratic leaders hope to present legislation next week at a party retreat that would mix revenues and spending cuts to replace the first three months of indiscriminate cuts while longer-term negotiations continue.Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, is assembling his own proposal to replace the across-the-board cuts with the elimination of duplicative efforts in the federal government in areas like the promotion of environmentally friendly construction, science and technology education, and work force training.Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan and chairman of the Armed Services Committee, has drafted more ambitious legislation to raise nearly $200 billion for sequester replacement by closing off a variety of offshore tax shelters, ending preferential tax treatment for many private equity and hedge fund managers, and taxing the exercise of stock options more heavily.“The fiscal situation is grave enough, the threat of sequestration is so serious in terms of its impact on our domestic priorities and on our security, that I believe that if we can get this in front of the Congress, because it will have huge public support, it will pass,” Mr. Levin said in an interview.But even the architects of such efforts are pessimistic that they have time to win passage.“I think sequester’s going to happen,” Mr. Coburn said. “I think people want it to happen.”Yet the economic recovery remains weak, and unemployment high. This week, Washington got one of the first signs of how the sequester might play out in the economy, when government figures showed that the economy had contracted in the final three months of 2012, largely a result of a 22 percent drop in military spending.Economists cautioned that they did not expect such a precipitous decline to continue in the coming quarters. Moreover, the drop came after a surge in military spending in the third quarter, as offices rushed to spend money obligated to the 2012 fiscal year.Still, the automatic cuts have the potential to derail the recovery. Macroeconomic Advisers, a forecasting firm in St. Louis, estimated that if the sequester came into full effect starting in March, it would knock 0.7 percentage points from economic growth in 2013, dropping it to 1.9 percent. Economists say hundreds of thousands of jobs could be lost, if not more.With half of the sequester hitting military spending, the worst effects would be felt by the Pentagon and military contractors. Congress already cut half a trillion dollars from military spending in the 2011 Budget Control Act, and the sequester would cut a further half-trillion.Defense companies have been engaged in an extensive behind-the-scenes effort to sway lawmakers, and they have warned that the cuts might lead to serious job losses, while also threatening the country’s security. “We’re sounding a full-throated alarm about this,” said Marion Blakey, the president of the Aerospace Industries Association, a lobbying group. “It was never intended to take place. It is terribly bad public policy. And it would have a very negative effect on our economy.”Concerns about the sequester cast a shadow over corporate earnings season in January. Many businesses said they expected Congress to delay or reduce the cuts, but warned of a bleak outlook if they took full effect. “While we recognize that both parties are strongly opposed to allowing sequestration to happen, we remain deeply concerned that sequestration could occur as the default outcome if negotiations fail,” Marillyn A. Hewson, the chief executive of Lockheed Martin, told investors in January. “Sequestration not only puts at risk our defense industrial base, it also harms military readiness.”But with just four weeks to go, the search for any replacement for the across-the-board cuts seems to be stumbling out of the gate.Senator Barbara Mikulski, Democrat of Maryland and chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, said Thursday that she would try to enlist the White House to help stop her own leadership’s three-month bill. She wants any legislation to last at least a year.“I hope the White House is not colluding with the 90-day reprieve,” she said. “This is like appeals on death row.”Mr. Levin’s tax bill effectively pits the defense industry against other heavyweights, especially high-tech companies like Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and Facebook, all of which are singled out by the Levin bill as abusers of the tax code. Dan Stohr, a spokesman for the Aerospace Industries Association, said military contractors were not going to be drawn into that fight.With the price of failure so high, Mr. Levin and Mr. Coburn said this week that their longstanding quests to cull the tax code of egregious loopholes and cut overlapping government programs could finally succeed. Mr. Levin pointed to two cases in particular. Microsoft develops software in the United States, sells intellectual property rights to subsidiaries in low-tax jurisdictions offshore, then shifts the bulk of its profits from product sales to those tax havens by paying its own subsidiaries royalties. Hewlett-Packard, like many companies, pays no taxes on overseas profits until they are brought back to the United States, but it has been able to keep cash flowing home through a series of tax-free loans from its offshore subsidiaries to its California headquarters.In testimony in September to Mr. Levin’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard executives said they were following the letter of United States tax law, but also said that the law was putting their companies at a disadvantage with competitors from other countries. Mr. Levin conceded that that argument had been persuasive with colleagues for years, as he sought to tighten tax loopholes.In lieu of a deal, Republican senators are drafting legislation at least to give agencies the flexibility to make the cuts more selectively, Mr. Coburn said.“Necessity becomes the mother of invention,” he said. “We’ve got smart people in these agencies. They will do what’s most important and least expensive.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/global/royal-dutch-shell-posts-5-6-billion-profit.html,"LONDON — Royal Dutch Shell, the largest oil company in Europe, disappointed investors Thursday with fourth-quarter earnings that came in well below analysts’ forecasts.The company posted a profit of $5.6 billion after one-time items and inventory changes, up 15 percent from the fourth quarter of 2011. But analysts had expected earnings of around $6.3 billion.Stuart Joyner, an analyst at Investec Securities in London, described the results as “a substantial miss.” The company’s shares closed 2.8 percent lower on the London Stock Exchange.For the full year, Shell reported earnings of $25.1 billion, up 2 percent over 2011.“We see solid underlying performance in much of the business in these numbers,” Peter Hutton, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets in London, wrote in a research note.Perhaps more than any other energy company, Shell invests in huge oil and gas projects that it hopes will produce steady returns for decades. One example is Pearl GTL in Qatar, which takes natural gas from the emirate’s enormous North Field and converts it into liquid fuels like diesel.Peter Voser, the chief executive of Shell, said production at the gas-to-liquids facility exceeded 90 percent of capacity in the fourth quarter.Pearl GTL cost around $20 billion, but it looks like it will be a big moneymaker for decades to come. And because its products are pegged to oil prices, it gives Shell and Qatar a hedge against lower gas prices.“We are on track despite some headwinds in 2012,” Mr. Voser said during a call with analysts Thursday. Mr. Voser, who comes from a financial background, made his reputation helping to turn around the Swiss machinery maker ABB a decade ago. He was appointed Shell’s chief financial officer in 2004 and was named chief executive in 2009.Mr. Voser said his goal was to deliver $175 billion to $200 billion of total cash flow from operations for 2012-15, a 30 percent to 50 percent increase over the previous four-year period.Still, there are reasons to worry about Shell. The fourth-quarter letdown was largely due to lower earnings in Shell’s core exploration and production business, mainly because of weak performance in the Americas.Shell’s high-profile, multibillion-dollar Alaska drilling program has encountered several snags and delays, including the running aground of the Kulluk drilling vessel on an uninhabited island in late December. Mr. Voser said that the Kulluk had been damaged and that another drilling vessel required upgrades. Shell is still weighing its next steps in Alaska, he said.Shell is also being hurt by natural gas prices in the United States that have been pushed down by the boom in shale gas production. Declining prices have led it to switch strategies and drill for gas deposits that are rich in liquids, which bring in more money than gas.Low gas prices raise questions about Shell’s huge bets on the fuel. Mr. Voser said the low prices in North America appeared likely to persist, but were “an opportunity” for Shell’s so-called integrated gas business, which is devoted primarily to liquefied natural gas and gas-to-liquids projects. These fast-growing businesses earned $9.4 billion in 2012, up from $6.4 billion in 2011.Exploration and production earnings for the quarter were $4.4 billion compared with $5.1 billion the previous year, with the U.S. exploration and production business reporting a $69 million loss, partly because of low natural gas prices.In another disappointment, Shell estimated that it replaced only 44 percent of the reserves of oil and gas that it produced in 2012. That indicated that the company’s exploration effort, despite increased emphasis and spending in recent years, may still not be performing well. Shell said its bookings of reserves were severely reduced last year by U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accounting rules that required it to cut its estimates of its gas resources in America to reflect low prices. Shell’s production was essentially flat in 2012, at 3.2 million barrels a day.The company increased its capital investment forecast for this year by 10 percent, to $33 billion — another worry for the markets, as it suggests that Shell may be having trouble controlling costs. Mr. Voser said that spending were running high across the industry, but that Shell was having more success in controlling costs than rivals.Shell said that it was likely to increase its dividend in the first quarter of 2013 to 45 cents a share, a 4.7 percent increase over the first quarter of 2012.Shell also had cause for relief on Wednesday when a court in The Hague dismissed most aspects of lawsuits brought against it by Nigerian farmers and fishermen seeking damages for pollution from oil spills in the Niger Delta."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/growth-in-consumer-spending-slows.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — The number of Americans seeking unemployment aid rose sharply last week but remained at a level consistent with moderate hiring.Weekly applications for unemployment benefits leapt 38,000 to a seasonally adjusted 368,000, the Labor Department said Thursday. Applications plummeted in the previous two weeks to five-year lows; applications fell by a combined 45,000 in the second and third weeks of January.The volatility reflects the government’s difficulty adjusting the data to account for layoffs after the holiday shopping season. Job cuts typically spike in the second week in January as retailers dismiss temporary employees hired for the winter holidays. Layoffs then fall in the second half of the month.The department tries to adjust for such fluctuations but the January figures can still be volatile. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, ticked up to 352,000, just above a four-year low.Most economists weren’t concerned by the increase.“This just reverses some of the previous sharp falls without altering the gradual downward trend,” said Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics.On Friday, the government is scheduled to issue its January jobs report. Analysts forecast that it will show employers added 155,000 jobs, the same as in December. The unemployment rate is expected to remain at 7.8 percent for the third straight month.That’s consistent with the number of people seeking unemployment aid. Applications fluctuated between 360,000 and 390,000 for most of last year. At the same time, employers added an average of 153,000 jobs a month.That’s just been enough to slowly push down the unemployment rate, which fell 0.7 percentage points last year to 7.8 percent.The number of people continuing to claim benefits also rose. More than 5.9 million people received benefits in the week ended Jan. 12, the latest data available. That’s 250,000 more than the previous week.Steady hiring is needed to resume economic growth. The government said Wednesday that the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the October-December quarter, hurt by a sharp cut in military spending, fewer exports and sluggish growth in company stockpiles.The contraction points to what is likely to be the biggest headwind for the economy this year: sharp government spending cuts and continuing budget fights.Two important drivers of growth improved last quarter. Consumer spending, which accounts for 70 percent of economic activity, increased at a faster pace and businesses invested more in equipment and software.Homebuilders are stepping up construction to meet rising demand. That could create more construction jobs.Home prices are rising steadily. That tends to make Americans feel wealthier and more likely to spend. Housing could add as much as 1 percentage point to economic growth this year, some economists estimate.And auto sales reached their highest level in five years in 2012. That’s increasing production and hiring atAmerican automakers and their suppliers."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/jon-leibowitz-resigns-as-ftc-chairman.html,"WASHINGTON — Jon Leibowitz, the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, said on Thursday that he would resign effective mid-February. His departure will end a four-year tenure in which he pushed for online privacy protections and sought to restrain unfair competition, but stumbled in an attempt to rein in the Internet search practices of Google.Mr. Leibowitz, 54, said in an interview that he intended to move to the private sector and was likely to focus on competition policy and privacy. His departure was widely expected and had been talked about among antitrust lawyers since last summer.“I felt like this was a good time to leave because we got through a number of things that I wanted the commission to address,” he said, citing the blocking of several regional hospital mergers and cases brought against Facebook and Google for violating their own privacy policies.This spring, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in an F.T.C. case involving generic drug companies that agree to delay putting new products on the market in exchange for payments from brand-name pharmaceutical companies that market similar drugs.Mr. Leibowitz’s successor could come from within the commission, with Democratic commissioners Julie Brill and Edith Ramirez considered contenders. Other possible candidates are Howard Shelanski, an antitrust expert who is director of the commission’s bureau of economics, and Philip J. Weiser, a former aide to Joel Klein at the Justice Department’s antitrust division.Under Mr. Leibowitz, who was a commissioner for more than four years before being appointed chairman in 2009, the commission also worked to expand the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act and brought an enforcement action against Intel for unfair competitive practices in the microprocessor market.Senator Amy Klobuchar, a Minnesota Democrat who is the new chairwoman of the Senate antitrust subcommittee, said Mr. Leibowitz had been able to get bipartisan attention paid to issues like generic-drug competition and telephone billing practices in part because of his experience as a staff aide on Capitol Hill.“He’s done really aggressive work to stop these pay-for-delay settlements,” she said, referring to drug industry practices. He also drew attention to cramming, the addition of unauthorized, often-unnoticed charges to consumers’ phone bills, she said.Other Democrats, including some consumer advocates, were less generous in their assessment, although none of them wanted to speak on the record. They noted, however, a few areas where the F.T.C. did not block merger actions, including a $2 billion proposal to join the Universal Music Group and EMI, two large record labels.Last year, the commission also approved the $29 billion merger of two of the nation’s largest pharmacy-benefit managers, Express Scripts and Medco Health Solutions.If only because it was his last big effort, however, the Google case is likely to be the one that is foremost in people’s minds over the next few years. Mr. Leibowitz sought the case, winning a cordial but tense battle with the Justice Department’s antitrust division over the right to investigate Google’s search practices.Competitors, advertisers and some consumer advocates had complained that Google manipulated the results of its Internet searches to give top priority to results that featured companies in which it held an interest, while punishing those that were a competitive threat.It was a widely watched case, not only because Google was one of the country’s largest companies, a symbol of the enormous success that could be bred by the Internet, but also because Mr. Leibowitz had made anticompetition enforcement a high priority.In 2009, shortly after he took over as chairman of the commission, Mr. Leibowitz threw down the gauntlet at a conference of antitrust lawyers, saying he intended to push the F.T.C. to protect consumers “by expanding the use of our authority to prohibit unfair methods of competition.”That authority, laid out in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, allows the commission more leeway than do antitrust laws to sanction companies for actions that might not be antitrust violations but that are unfair and deceptive practices.But when the F.T.C.’s five commissioners looked closely at Google’s practices, they unanimously agreed that while some of its behavior was not beneficial to competitors, over all its actions improved its search results for the benefits of users. The commission did get Google to agree to voluntarily change some of its methods; critics of that agreement, including one commissioner who dissented on that part of the decision, said the voluntary agreement was essentially unenforceable because it did not have court authority behind it.The F.T.C. did bring formal charges against Google in another matter, reaching a settlement of charges that Google illegally refused to license some of its patents for cellular phone technology to companies, like Apple, whose products compete with Google’s Android operating system.“That would have been a much harder case to bring under antitrust law,” Mr. Leibowitz said.Asked if he felt the Google case was a failure, Mr. Leibowitz gave an unequivocal no.“You don’t take these jobs without wanting to bring a big case,” he said. “But I think we did our job there.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/business/global/nikkeis-best-weekly-run-in-54-years.html,"TOKYO — The year 1959 was in many ways remarkable. America granted Alaska and Hawaii statehood, Fidel Castro took power in Cuba and Singapore gained its independence from Britain. The Barbie doll and pantyhose went on sale for the first time; Miles Davis recorded “Kind of Blue” at a New York studio.Until Friday, 1959 was also the last time the Nikkei 225 stock index rallied for 12 straight weeks, driven by the quickening pace of Japan’s postwar economic boom. Now the index has repeated that feat, rising 0.47 percent to 11,191.34 on Friday to finish the week up 2.5 percent. The Japanese business media have been quick to jump on the historical tidbit, trumpeting the Nikkei’s best weekly run in 54 years. The rally in 1959 actually lasted 17 weeks.This time around, the Nikkei’s rally was motivated by the new Japanese prime minister, Shinzo Abe. Mr. Abe has galvanized markets by encouraging bold monetary measures to beat deflation, and hefty government spending to jump-start the economy. The result has been a weakening of the yen by 15 percent over the past three months, a boon for Japanese exporters, and a 25 percent surge in the stock market over the same period.“The expectations pinned on Prime Minister Abe’s drive to tackle deflation and the strong yen are the driving force pushing stocks toward this postwar record,” the Nikkei newspaper said.The market’s climb comes despite lackluster earnings by Japanese companies. Of the 54 companies on the Nikkei index that had posted results for the October-to-December quarter by Thursday, nearly two-thirds missed market expectations, according to Thomson Reuters StarMine, the investment research service. And for now, households have remained cool to the market buzz. Japanese household spending fell 0.7 percent in December from a year earlier in price-adjusted real terms, government data released Friday showed.Nevertheless, Mr. Abe’s policies, dubbed “Abenomics,” are having “a positive psychological effect” on investors and corporate executives, Yasushi Hoshi, director of capital markets at the Daiwa Institute of Research, wrote in a note published Friday. “And the exchange rate and stock prices, if sustained, could themselves push up corporate earnings, leading to better corporate and consumer sentiment in a positive cycle.”There are already signs that the weaker yen is bolstering some earnings. The video game maker Nintendo raised its profit forecast for its current financial year on Thursday even as the company reported disappointing sales of its game consoles.Overall investor optimism is giving companies the benefit of the doubt. Honda Motor surprised investors Thursday by trimming its profit outlook, citing sluggish demand in China and Europe, but they still snapped up Honda shares early on Friday, and the stock finished the day 0.3 percent higher.Still, there are budding concerns that Mr. Abe’s drive will bring about a dangerous bubble. “The results in the near term are an investment boom and bubble, but the longer-run consequences could be soaring inflation and fiscal crisis, followed by lengthy economic stagnation,” Ryutaro Kono, chief economist for Japan at BNP Paribas Securities, wrote in a recent report.From a historical perspective, the Nikkei index and other asset prices remain far below the heights seen during Japan’s last economic bubble, in the late 1980s. For many global investors, the recent rally has only begun to reverse a slump in Japanese equities that has taken them to levels seen as ridiculously low. Shares on Tokyo’s broader Topix index long traded below their book value, meaning that prices were less than what the companies would fetch if they were dissolved and their parts sold off.Now, foreign investors are leading the charge, having poured a net ¥248.6 billion, or $2.7 billion, into Japanese stocks in the fourth week of January alone.“We think there is latent demand because supply in this space has dwindled over the years and investors are thinking about coming back,” Patric de Gentile-Williams of Financial Risk Management, told the Hedge Funds Review on Wednesday, after making a $25 million investment in a Japanese equity fund run by Arena Capital Management. “If the new prime minister’s actions have a big effect, they might come back in a big way.”Is Japan, then, on course for a wider recovery?Not so fast, Yusuke Shimoda, an economist at the Japan Research Institute in Tokyo, wrote in a note to clients this past week. Japan’s recovery could sputter, he said, if the government cannot match its asset-inflating moves with growth strategies for the real economy. “It will be critical to put a growth strategy in action that will start a self-sustained recovery,” Mr. Shimoda said.Nevertheless, Japan forecast Monday that its economy would grow by 2.5 percent in the fiscal year that starts in April, raising an earlier projection of 1.7 percent — an impressive rate for the world’s third-largest economy after the United States and China. Impressive, that is, unless investors look back to Japan’s rate of gross domestic product growth in 1959, which was 12.1 percent."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/business/economy/for-markets-a-strong-january-is-a-good-sign.html,"AS January goes, so goes the year.That maxim of the American stock market would seem to bode well for the market this year. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index’s gain of 5 percent made the month the 12th best January since 1950, and the 19th opening month in that period when the index rose more than 4 percent.“If history repeats, we would expect a double-digit percentage increase in the upcoming 11 months,” said Richard Peterson, an analyst at S&P Capital IQ.Only once since 1950 has the market fallen in the last 11 months of a year when it rose 4 percent or more in January. That was in 1987, which began with the best January in the history of the index — up 13.2 percent — and ended including the worst single day ever for the index, a 20 percent plunge on Oct. 19.On average since 1950, January gains of at least 4 percent have been followed by rises of 15.1 percent in the remainder of the year. Gains were lower when January gains were smaller, and on average the market has made no headway in years after prices fell in January.There is, of course, no guarantee that history will repeat. In fact, during the Great Depression the opposite pattern existed. The market rose sharply during the first month of 1929, 1930, 1931 and 1934, only to plunge the rest of each year. Prices fell in the first month of 1935, which turned out to be an excellent year.The January gains this year reflected generally strong markets around the world. As can be seen in the accompanying charts, all but two of the 20 largest stock markets in the world rose in January, and six of them — Japan, China, Britain, Switzerland, Sweden and Italy — rose more rapidly than the American market did. The two that showed losses were Brazil and South Korea.The ranking of markets is based on World Bank calculations of total market capitalization of each market in 2011. More than half the capitalization of those 20 markets is in just the top three, the United States, Japan and China. The top five — Britain and Canada in addition to the other three — have two-thirds of the value.The United States market is one of 10 that have more than doubled from their credit crisis lows set in 2008 or 2009, the others being Brazil, Germany, India, South Korea, Hong Kong, South Africa, Russia, Sweden and Mexico.The only three countries in the group that are not at least 50 percent higher than their lows are all in the euro zone, where economies have been stumbling. They are France, Spain and Italy."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/business/economy/manufacturing-activity-rises-for-second-consecutive-month.html,"Manufacturing activity in the United States grew at a faster pace in January, driven by an increase in new orders and more hiring at factories.The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group of supply management professionals, said Friday that its index of manufacturing activity jumped to 53.1 in January from 50.2 in December. It was the highest reading since April, when the index hit 54.1.Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.In another positive economic report, the Commerce Department said spending on construction projects rose in December, ending a year in which construction activity increased for the first time in six years.The second straight monthly increase in the manufacturing index showed that activity was starting to grow again after struggling through most of 2012. Uncertainty about tax increases and deep government spending cuts led many companies to reduce orders for machinery and equipment earlier this year. And a weaker global economy dampened demand for American exports.The report was also encouraging because it showed that demand for factory goods increased while consumers started to pay higher Social Security taxes. That left them with less take-home pay, which could hurt consumer spending.The survey came hours after the Labor Department reported that employers added 157,000 jobs in January. Manufacturers added 4,000 jobs last month, the fourth straight monthly increase.“There’s a fair bit of optimism here to start the year,” said Dan Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG LLC, a trading firm based in New York.Mr. Greenhaus said the solid manufacturing gains, especially in new orders and employment, suggested that “the larger story remains intact, of a moderate, ongoing recovery.”The I.S.M. report showed that 13 of the 18 industries surveyed had an increase in activity last month. They included manufacturers of plastics and rubber, textiles, furniture, printing, and apparel. Four industries reported contraction: minerals, computers and electronics, wood and chemicals.The survey’s new orders index returned to growth, rising to 53.3 in January from 49.7 in December. Companies reported adding to their inventories in January after two months of declines, a sign that factories are preparing to increase production.Slower growth in stockpiles was a major reason the economy shrank at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the quarter from October to December, the first contraction in three and a half years.Construction spending rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $885 billion in December, up 0.9 percent from November when spending increased a revised 0.1 percent. For all of 2012, construction spending totaled $850.2 billion, a gain of 9.2 percent from 2011, when construction spending had fallen 3.3 percent. Even with the increase, construction activity is 27.2 percent below its high of $1.17 trillion in 2006 at the peak of the housing boom.Construction has been posting a slow recovery, led by housing gains. In December, housing and nonresidential construction posted gains but spending on government projects fell."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/technology/ftc-suggests-do-not-track-feature-for-mobile-software-and-apps.html,"WASHINGTON — In a strong move to protect the privacy of Americans as they use the Internet on their smartphones and tablets, the Federal Trade Commission on Friday said the mobile industry should include a do-not-track feature in software and apps and take other steps to safeguard personal information.The staff report, which was approved by the commission, is not binding, but it is an indication of how seriously the agency is focused on mobile privacy. As if to emphasize that, the commission on Friday separately fined Path, a two-year-old social networking app, $800,000. It charged the company with violating federal privacy protections for children by collecting personal information on underage users, including almost everyone in users’ address books.Together the actions represent the government’s heightened scrutiny of mobile devices, which for many Americans have become the primary way of gaining access to the Internet, rather than through a laptop or desktop computer.“We‘ve been looking at privacy issues for decades,” said Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman. “But this is necessary because so much commerce is moving to mobile, and many of the rules and practices in the mobile space are sort of like the Wild West.”The report lays out a clear picture of what sort of activities might bring a company under investigation — like, for example, conveying the impression that an app will gather geolocation data only one time, when, in fact, it does so repeatedly.For companies like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and BlackBerry (formerly Research in Motion), the suggestions essentially carry the weight of policy.But the F.T.C. also has its sights on thousands of small businesses that create apps that smartphone users can download for a specific service. The introduction of the iPhone created a sort of gold rush among start-ups to create apps featuring games, music, maps and consumer services like shopping and social networking.“This says if you’re outside the recommended behavior, you’re at a higher risk of enforcement action,” said Mary Ellen Callahan, a partner at Jenner & Block and former chief privacy officer for the Department of Homeland Security.Morgan Reed, executive director of the Association for Competitive Technology, a trade group representing app developers, said that the organization generally supported the commission’s report but that it had some concerns about what he called “unintended consequences.”If app stores are worried about their own liability over whether they have adequately checked the privacy protections of a mobile app they sell, they might err on the side of caution and not screen for privacy at all, he said.The federal recommendations follow a similar set of guidelines issued last month by the California attorney general, whose tips effectively set the standard for technology companies nationwide, given the state’s huge consumer market.The trade commission and the Obama administration last year issued separate sets of recommendations for safeguarding consumers’ online privacy, and the subject has attracted growing concern in Congress.But most of the focus to date, particularly with do-not-track policies, has been on Internet browsers commonly used at home but not on cellphones. Do-not-track features let users request that their footsteps not be followed as they move around online.The commission and the administration have begun to focus on mobile data privacy partly because smartphones let so many entities gain access to personal information, including wireless service providers, mobile operating system developers, handset manufacturers, app companies, analytics outfits and advertisers — “a degree unprecedented in the desktop environment,” the report said.The activities of Path, a company in San Francisco, illustrate some of the F.T.C.’s concerns. The company developed a social networking app that allows people to keep an online journal about moments in their lives, including written entries, photos, music to which they are listening and their location. A user can share a journal with up to 150 people. The app has been installed more than 2.5 million times.The F.T.C. asserted that Path, without alerting its users, had engaged in deceptive practices because it routinely collected and stored information about the contacts in users’ address books. The privacy policy that Path provided to consumers said it collected limited, mainly technical information about users’ devices.In fact, the commission said, Path was collecting personal details including addresses, phone numbers, usernames for Facebook and Twitter, as well as dates of birth.The company also collected some of that information from users who, in signing up for the service, indicated that they were under age 13 without permission of their parents or disclosure of how it would use the information — violations of rules adopted under the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act.Path, without admitting or denying the accusations, agreed to pay an $800,000 fine and to comply with the children’s privacy act, destroy already collected children’s information, follow its own stated privacy policy and have its privacy efforts monitored by an outside party.In a statement posted on its Web site, Path said that “there was a period of time where our system was not automatically rejecting people who indicated that they were under 13.” But even before the F.T.C. contacted the company, Path said, “we discovered and fixed this sign-up process qualification and took further action by suspending any underage accounts that had mistakenly been allowed to be created.”The F.T.C. staff report, which was approved by a 4-to-0 vote, with one commission member not participating, recognized that steps were already being taken to adopt best practices for privacy protection. Among them is the creation of a group, Moms With Apps, which developed a badge icon to alert parents to the advertising and data-collection practices of apps aimed at children.Even before this report, “the F.T.C. has not been meek,” said Lisa J. Sotto, managing partner of Hunton & Williams in New York. “They have brought a number of enforcement actions,” she said. “Those in the mobile ecosystem know they’re in the regulators’ sights.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/business/economy/us-adds-157000-jobs-unemployment-rate-edges-up-to-7-9.html,"Political gridlock over fiscal policy didn’t push the economy off a cliff. But it certainly isn’t helping anything, either.Despite the chaos and uncertainty hovering over tax rates and government budget cuts at the turn of the year, job growth accelerated at the end of 2012 and was even faster than originally estimated, the Labor Department said on Friday. Job growth also continued at a steady if modest pace in January, with employers adding 157,000 payroll positions, though the unemployment rate ticked up to 7.9 percent.Better readings on construction spending, manufacturing and consumer sentiment released on Friday also allayed fears that had arisen from a sour report on the nation’s economic growth earlier in the week.The upward revisions to job growth, in particular, encouraged traders on Wall Street, sending the Dow Jones industrial average over 14,000 for the first time since 2007.“The economy, sales, employment and the stock market are all higher in spite of the bickering and rancor in Washington,” said Bernard Baumohl, the chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. The latest numbers “all point to an economy that is building steam and a private sector that seems almost dismissive to the sequestration and debt ceiling threats from Washington.”Still, job growth has been modest compared with previous recoveries, and the unemployment rate has been stuck just below 8 percent since September. And Washington is gearing up for yet another showdown over fiscal policy, with severe spending cuts kicking in on March 1 if Congress fails to reach a budget bargain, just as Americans are starting to notice the larger tax bite in their paychecks from higher payroll and income taxes.“Negotiations over the debt ceiling and the budget resolution and sequestration have the potential to be very messy and very extended,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. Businesses still seem “very vulnerable to surprises. I don’t think we’ve got the solidity and robustness and willingness to look beyond these short-term disturbances yet,” he said.Within January’s employment report, construction was one of the more encouraging areas, adding jobs in each of the last four months. This was probably the result of rebuilding from Hurricane Sandy, unseasonably warm weather that led to fewer work stoppages and the nascent housing recovery, said Joshua Shapiro, chief United States economist at MFR.Retailing, health care and the wholesale trade also added positions in January, while the government again shed jobs. Government payrolls shrank in most months over the last four years. The pullback in government spending, especially on the military, led to a slight contraction in fourth-quarter gross domestic product, reported on Wednesday. The decline in military spending was partly caused by uncertainty over the fiscal impasse, which eased temporarily with a compromise in Washington at the start of the year.Friday’s employment report was “a reminder of the importance of the need for Congress to act to avoid self-inflicted wounds to the economy,” Alan B. Krueger, the chairman of President Obama’s Council of Economic Advisers, said in a statement. Republican leaders countered with attacks on Mr. Obama’s economic track record, with Representative Kevin Brady, the incoming chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, saying that “a run-in-place jobs report and unemployment stuck near 8 percent” is “Obama’s new normal.”The revisions for the fourth quarter would seem to disprove accusations that the Obama administration inflated job growth ahead of the November election, since the original estimates were recalculated to show there was even more growth. The economy added 335,000 more jobs than originally estimated during all of 2012, including an additional 150,000 in the last quarter of the year. That was on top of the previously reported fourth-quarter job growth of 453,000 and 2012 growth of 1.8 million.Still, hiring growth has been uninspiring in the last year, trudging along just barely fast enough to keep up with population growth but not nearly quickly enough to put a major dent in unemployment. A backlog of 12.3 million idle workers remains. The average worker who is unemployed has been pounding the pavement for 35 weeks.“I have been working for 40 years and I have looked for jobs many times in the past, including in bad economies, and I’ve never experienced anything like this,” said Mary Livingston, a human resources professional in Wayland, Mass. She was laid off two years ago on Friday.She said she believed that employers were reluctant to hire her because of her age — she is 63 — and because she hadn’t held a permanent job in so long. But she said they also seemed unwilling to hire anyone.“I’ve seen positions posted two years ago that still have not been filled,” she said. “There seems to be this tremendous fear of making a decision. A lot of my colleagues will go for 15, 20, 23 interviews with the same company.”Uncertainty over fiscal policy and the fragility of the economy still seem to be holding back employers, despite a number of underlying sources of growth in places like the housing market and auto sales. Economists are forecasting job growth of around 170,000 a month for the rest of 2013, comparable to job growth over the last year.Exactly what this pace of job growth means for the unemployment rate depends on whether many of the workers sitting on the sidelines decide to join, or rejoin, the labor force. Right now, labor force participation rates — that is, the share of people of working age who are working or looking for jobs — is 63.6 percent, close to a 30-year low.Only those who are actively looking for work are counted as unemployed, so if labor force participation stays low, even modest job growth can cause the unemployment rate to fall quite a bit. It has come down several percentage points since peaking at 10 percent in October 2009.“The decline in the unemployment rate really masks how protracted the crisis really is,” said Christine L. Owens, the executive director of the National Employment Law Project, a labor research and advocacy group. “It’s coming down largely for the wrong reason: because people are dropping out of the labor market or not entering it.”For the long-term unemployed — who now represent nearly 40 percent of all jobless workers — the opportunities still seem few and far between. Millions have exhausted their unemployment benefits, and many more will roll off the government’s system in the coming months with no options in sight.“Who are these people who are getting jobs? Where are they? I don’t know them,” said Karen Duckett, 51, who was laid off from her job as director of housekeeping at a retirement community in late 2011. She recently received a letter saying her benefits would end in two weeks because the unemployment rate in Maryland, where she lives, had fallen below 7 percent, so the state no longer qualified for the third tier of federal emergency benefits.“I am just so angry right now,” said Ms. Duckett, who has been invited for only two job interviews despite submitting dozens of applications. “How do you expect for me to find a job in two weeks if I haven’t been able to find one in a year and a half?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/business/economy/as-growth-lags-some-press-the-fed-to-do-still-more.html,"WASHINGTON — In the five months since the Federal Reserve started a campaign to increase growth and reduce unemployment, the economy has slowed and unemployment has increased.The Labor Department said on Friday that the jobless rate rose to 7.9 percent last month, up from 7.8 percent in December, in the latest evidence that the economy still is not growing fast enough to repair the damage of a recession that ended in 2009.Some economists found the disappointing data an indication the Fed had reached the limit of its powers, or at least of prudent action. But there is evidence that the Fed is not trying as hard as it could to stimulate growth: it is allowing inflation to fall well below the 2 percent pace it considers most healthy.Inflation, unlike job creation, is something the Fed can control with some precision. Higher inflation could accelerate economic growth and job creation by encouraging people to spend more and make riskier investments.Yet annualized inflation fell to 1.3 percent in December, and asset prices reflect an expectation that the pace will remain well below 2 percent in the next decade.“By their own framework, they’re not doing enough,” said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Michigan. “They said that they were going to expand the economy and keep inflation around 2 percent, and they just haven’t done it.”The rest of the government is making that task more difficult. Federal spending cuts, tax increases and the prospect of further cuts March 1 are hurting growth. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, has warned repeatedly that monetary policy cannot offset such fiscal austerity.And it is likely that the latest economic data does not reflect the full impact of the Fed’s efforts. Despite the rise in unemployment, job creation has increased in recent months, consumer spending has strengthened and the housing market is healing. Partly because monetary policy is slow-acting, most forecasters expect modest growth this year.But the Fed also is acting with a clear measure of restraint. Mr. Bernanke and other officials have made clear that they believe the central bank could do more to increase the pace of inflation and bolster growth and job creation. They simply are not persuaded that the benefits outweigh the potential costs — in particular, the risk that their efforts will distort asset prices and seed future financial crises.The Fed is constrained in part because it already has done so much. The central bank has held short-term interest rates near zero since December 2008, and it has accumulated almost $3 trillion in Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities to push down long-term rates and encourage riskier investments.Under its newest effort, announced in September and extended in December, it will increase its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds by $85 billion a month until the job market improves. The Fed also said that it planned to hold short-term rates near zero even longer, at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent.In normal times, the Fed would respond to flagging inflation and growth by cutting interest rates. At present, it could still increase the scale of its asset purchases. The two policies work in a similar way, stimulating economic activity by reducing borrowing costs and encouraging risk-taking. But asset purchases are a less direct method to reduce rates, and the available evidence suggests that the effect is less powerful.The Fed’s holdings of mortgage bonds and Treasuries also are growing so large that it could begin to distort pricing in those markets, and some transactions could be disrupted by a dearth of safe assets. Some Fed officials are concerned that asset prices for farmland, junk bonds and other risky assets are being pushed to unsustainable levels. As a result, Mr. Bernanke has said, the Fed is doing less than it otherwise would.“We have to pay very close attention to the costs and the risks and the efficacy of these nonstandard policies as well as the potential economic benefits,” Mr. Bernanke said last month, in response to a question about the low pace of inflation. “Economics tells you when something is more costly, you do a little bit less of it.”The Fed to some extent may be a prisoner of its own success in persuading investors over the last three decades that it was determined to keep inflation below 2 percent. It said in December that it would let expected inflation in the next two to three years rise as high as 2.5 percent. But expectations have not budged.The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland calculated in a January report that average expected inflation over the next decade was just 1.48 percent per year.Fed officials themselves generally expect somewhat higher inflation, but their most recent predictions, published in January, still show that none of the 19 policy makers expected inflation to exceed 2 percent over the next two years.“It’s been harder to create expected inflation than I thought before this crisis,” said Mark Thoma, a professor of economics at the University of Oregon. “Probably because of their own credibility, nobody believes them even if they say it.”But Professor Thoma and others also note that the Fed could be trying harder. Mr. Bernanke and other Fed officials have been careful to say that they will tolerate inflation expectations above 2 percent while also insisting that it is not a Fed goal to push expectations above 2 percent.At the meeting of the Fed’s policy-making committee last week, none of the 12 voting members supported stronger action to increase inflation or growth. One member voted in opposition to continuing the existing efforts.“They are doing $85 billion a month in purchases. Well, there’s a number that’s twice as large as 85 and twice as large as that,” said Professor Wolfers. “It’s clear that they can do more. But they keep saying one thing and doing another.”That reluctance ultimately reflects the enduring conviction of many Fed officials that their most important responsibility is maintaining stable inflation in the long run.When inflation rises unpredictably, it disrupts economic activity by making it impossible for companies to tell the difference between increased demand for their products and generally higher prices. High inflation also taxes wealth, rewarding borrowers at the expense of lenders by eroding the value of fixed payments.“We, the Federal Reserve, have spent 30 years building up credibility for low and stable inflation, which has proved extremely valuable in that we’ve been able to take strong accommodative actions in the last four, five years,” Mr. Bernanke said last year, when asked why the Fed would not push inflation higher to hasten the pace of the economic recovery. “To risk that asset for what I think would be quite tentative and perhaps doubtful gains on the real side would be, I think, an unwise thing to do.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/business/car-sales-continue-their-climb.html,"DETROIT — Automakers said new vehicle sales in the United States rose sharply in January, indicating that the industry’s steady recovery is not slowing despite weak job growth and an uncertain economy.A total of 1.04 million cars and trucks were sold during the month, a 14 percent increase from January 2012, according to the research firm the Autodata Corporation.Analysts said the strong demand surpassed their expectations. They cited improved sales of pickup trucks as a sign that construction contractors and other businesses were optimistic about the economy.“Sales were at the high end of the forecast,” said Jesse Toprak, an analyst at the auto research site TrueCar.com. “The main reason was the truck segment outperformed for the most part.”In 2012, the industry turned in its best performance in five years, with sales of 14.5 million vehicles — a 13 percent increase over 2011.Auto executives and analysts are forecasting sales this year as high as 15.5 million vehicles. They attribute the positive outlook in part to consumers’ need to replace aging vehicles, a factor that has driven strong industry sales since last year, and in part to improvements in housing starts.While Toyota had the best month among the major automakers, all of the Detroit car companies reported solid gains.General Motors, the largest of the Detroit manufacturers, said it sold 194,700 cars and trucks in January, a 16 percent increase from a year ago. All four of the company’s domestic brands — Chevrolet, Cadillac, GMC and Buick — had double-digit increases for the month, it said.G.M. has also rebounded from tepid sales of its core pickup trucks in recent months. It said sales of its Chevrolet Silverado pickup increased 32 percent from January 2012, and sales of the GMC Sierra improved 35 percent.“The year is off to a very good start for General Motors,” said Kurt McNeil, head of G.M.’s United States sales operations. “There’s a sense of optimism among our dealers that only comes when you pair a growing economy with great new products.”Ford Motor, the second-biggest American automaker, said its sales in January rose 22 percent, to 166,500 vehicles. The company’s passenger cars did particularly well, with an increase for the month of 34 percent. Sales of the recently redesigned Ford Fusion midsize sedan, which had been hampered by safety recalls, rose 64.5 percent.“Much hand-wringing has taken place over early recalls of the Ford Escape and Ford Fusion,” said Michelle Krebs, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com. “But that doesn’t appear to matter to consumers, who bought those models in big numbers.”Executives at Ford said the company expected consumer demand to grow consistently in 2013.“The biggest driver of the year is going to be replacement,” said Kenneth M. Czubay, Ford’s United States sales and marketing chief.Chrysler, the smallest Detroit car company, said it sold 117,700 vehicles in January. That was a 16 percent increase from the same month in 2012, and it extended Chrysler’s year-over-year sales gains to 34 consecutive months.The company said sales of its cars rose about 50 percent, while sales of its sport utility vehicles and trucks increased 3 percent. Its new small car, the Dodge Dart, had its best performance since being introduced in June.Toyota, the biggest Japanese automaker, said its sales in January grew 26.6 percent, to 157,700 vehicles. Its bellwether car models generated much of the increase, with a 32.4 percent gain for the Corolla compact sedan and a 36.5 percent rise in sales of the Prius line of gas-electric hybrids.Toyota also expects to gain market share with edgy redesigns of previously lackluster models like the Avalon sedan, which had a 50.4 percent increase in sales in January.The other two large Japanese auto companies, Honda and Nissan, lagged the overall industry gains.Honda said it sold 93,600 vehicles, an increase of 12.8 percent from a year earlier. Nissan struggled even more to keep pace, reporting a 2 percent increase in sales, to 80,900.Sales also cooled for the German automaker Volkswagen, which was one of the industry’s best performers in 2012.Last year, combined sales of the company’s Volkswagen and Audi brands grew more than 30 percent in the United States. In January, however, it reported that sales increased just 7.1 percent.“The disappointment in the month was probably Volkswagen,” Mr. Toprak said. “It’s probably not a major worry, as long as these numbers aren’t sustained for several months.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/us/crow-indians-suit-against-federal-agent-allowed.html,"Two families from the Crow Indian Reservation in Montana can proceed with a lawsuit against an F.B.I. agent that accuses him of failing to properly investigate crimes against American Indians on and around the reservation, the United States Supreme Court has ruled.The court declined last month to reverse a 2010 federal court ruling that said the F.B.I. agent, Matthew Oravec, did not have qualified immunity from legal action, a protection usually given to government employees when acting in an official capacity — and a status sought by the Justice Department, which had appealed the ruling by the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.“The decision puts federal and state law enforcement agents on notice that they may be held personally liable if they discriminate against Indians in investigating crimes against them,” said Patricia S. Bangert, a Denver lawyer who is representing one of the families.The Supreme Court’s decision was dated Jan. 14, but lawyers were only recently made aware of it.Mr. Oravec, who remains an F.B.I. employee, investigated the deaths of two men, Robert Springfield and Steven Bearcrane, who died in unrelated episodes on the reservation in 2004 and 2005, respectively.Federal prosecutors did not file charges in either case, and the men’s families sued, accusing Mr. Oravec of conducting a second-rate investigation, which they said was part of a wider problem of discrimination against Indian crime victims on the reservation.The lawsuit also asserted that Mr. Oravec had sought to intimidate family members, made derogatory remarks about Indians and had refused to carry out basic investigative tasks, including interviewing potential witnesses or taking crime scene photographs.The Justice Department, which is representing Mr. Oravec, declined to comment.The rate of violent crime on Indian reservations has for decades been far higher than in the rest of the nation. Most tribes, including the Crow Nation, rely on the federal government to investigate and prosecute serious crime because states generally lack jurisdiction there, and because tribes are prohibited from imposing sentences longer than three years.But many Indians say that the crime problem  is connected to the failure of F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors  to take violent acts on reservations as seriously as they do crimes elsewhere.The lawsuit is being closely watched around Indian country. Filed in 2009, it maintains that federal officials violated the Fifth Amendment, guaranteeing equal protection and due process rights. In its 2010 ruling, the Ninth Circuit Court dropped several other F.B.I. agents and federal prosecutors from the lawsuit but allowed the claim against Mr. Oravec to continue.Mr. Bearcrane, 24, was fatally shot on a ranch on the reservation in 2005, but federal officials determined the shooting had been committed in self-defense and declined to prosecute. But Mr. Bearcrane’s parents, Earline Cole and Cletus Cole, said that Mr. Oravec had conducted only a cursory investigation before arriving at his conclusion.Ms. Bangert, who is representing the Bearcrane-Cole family, said they had offered to dismiss the lawsuit if the federal government agreed to allow a third party to investigate independently, but that the government had declined.“All the Bearcrane-Cole family has wanted is for Steven’s death to mean something,” Ms. Bangert said. “The government’s continuing action in brushing it off as a nonevent that can just be ignored is the continuing fuel for much of the family’s anger and anguish.”In the other case that prompted the lawsuit, Mr. Springfield failed to return from a bow hunting trip on the Crow reservation in 2004. His wife, Veronica Springfield, said the F.B.I. had not looked for him, and his body was found more than a year later."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/your-money/exchange-traded-funds-grow-in-complexity.html,"THIS week was the 20th anniversary of the creation of the first exchange-traded fund, the Standard & Poor’s Depositary Receipts E.T.F., which tracks the performance of the S.& P. 500 index and is bought and sold like a single stock. Even now, what is known as the SPDR S.& P. 500 remains the largest, with nearly $130 billion in assets.Its selling point is its simplicity: the shares are liquid, the fees are low and the holdings are easy to see. It and the many exchange-traded funds that followed were the foundation for the movement toward low-cost, passive investing that aims to increase returns by eliminating the inconsistent performance of many active investors: the fund will track whatever index it is following.At a lunch to observe the anniversary, Jim Ross, a senior managing director at State Street Global Advisors and one of the creators of the Standard & Poor’s E.T.F., which trades as SPY, said that the funds would continue over the next 20 years to be vehicles that allow people to invest in increasingly sophisticated ways.The funds now represent a nearly $2 trillion industry, which promotes itself as easy for the average investor to understand but, as Mr. Ross indicated, is becoming ever more complex.HISTORY The genesis of SPY was a report on the causes of the 1987 stock market crash that said that a way to trade a marketbasket of stocks would have lessened the impact of the crash. From that, an executive at the American Stock Exchange got the idea to bring together a group of commodity traders, index managers, accountants, economists and a specialist trading firm to work out the logistics of trading an entire index as if it were a single stock.After State Street created SPY, iShares followed three years later with a host of funds that tracked different indexes in large economies, like Britain, Japan and Australia. State Street countered in 1998 with a series of funds that invested in sectors, like technology and energy, and the race was on.Today, there are over 1,200 exchange-traded funds in the United States alone, and another 1,700 in Europe, according to ETF Global, a data provider. Many track indexes or baskets of stocks for a particular country or industry.The funds have allowed clients and advisers to easily take a broad position. Pooneh Baghai, a senior partner at McKinsey & Company, said that simplicity had allowed advisers to act more like chief investment officers, focused on asset allocations, and not stock pickers in search of a couple of winning investments.Like most financial products, exchange-traded funds started out simple and have grown complex. The newest innovations are funds that offer enhanced returns — known as levered, or leveraged, funds — and manage volatility. The E.T.F. label gives the funds the veneer of simplicity, but they can produce outcomes that investors did not expect.One example is a fund that resets its leverage each day. Greg Peterson, director of research at Ballentine Partners, said he showed clients how they could end up losing more money than they expected.Consider a regular S.& P. 500 E.T.F. and an S.& P. 500 E.T.F. that doubles the gains or losses. Both have $100 on Day 1. On the second day, the S.& P. index drops 25 percent. The regular fund is down to $75; the levered one is down to $50. The following day the S.& P. is up 50 percent. The regular fund rises to $112.50, and the levered one is at $100. On the fourth day, the S.& P. drops 10 percent. The regular fund is down to $101.25, while the levered one is at $80. “You’ve got to know what you’re buying,” Mr. Peterson said. “The E.T.F. will do what it says it will do. But people don’t know what to expect.”ADVANTAGES Low fees and no distribution of taxes are two of the selling points that distinguish exchange-traded funds from mutual funds. But there are caveats.Exchange-traded funds that allow people to invest in securities that may be less liquid or more complex would be expected to charge higher fees, and they do. The AdvisorShares Active Bear E.T.F., which focuses on betting against securities, charges 1.68 percent of the amount invested, while the average fee for most E.T.F.’s is 0.6 percent, according to ETF Global.But even funds doing simple things charge differently. Vanguard’s S.& P. 500 E.T.F. charges 0.05 percent. The iShares version costs 0.07 percent. But the State Street SPY, which is triple the size of the other two combined, charges the highest fee, 0.0945 percent. (The fee 20 years ago was 0.2 percent.)“If you hold it for five years, that cheaper E.T.F. may make more sense,” Mr. Ross said. “But it’s like going into the drugstore: the generics are always cheaper, but they may not be better.”The funds are also appealing because most of them do not make capital gains distributions the way a mutual fund investing in similar securities does, and so have lower taxes.A simple way to think about why this is, is that when you buy an exchange-traded fund, you’re buying a share of one thing, like a stock, on an exchange. When you buy mutual fund shares, you’re buying a basket of other securities that are being bought and sold and thus generating capital gains and losses.Of course, if you eventually sell E.T.F. shares at a gain, you will pay a capital-gains tax on them. And there are exceptions to the tax efficiencies, like certain fixed-income funds and more esoteric funds that invest in commodities and currencies through futures contracts.ADVANCES AND CAVEATS There are several trends in exchange-traded funds that could confuse average investors. One is creating portfolios of the funds that are actively managed. Whereas average investors think of the funds as a cheap way to invest in an index, active managers are using them to take positions just the same as any active manager.“If you have a view of how monetary easing in Japan is going to play out, you can work with a provider to express that view,” said Pete Quinn, president and chief operating officer of the Riverfront Investment Group, which manages $3.4 billion in E.T.F. strategies.Another is using the funds to follow trends in the markets. David Kreinces, founder and portfolio manager of ETF Portfolio Management, said his small fund used an algorithm to essentially make investments based on the direction of a market.Then, there is the complexity of the funds themselves. ETF Global seeks to make sense of the relative merits of various exchange-traded funds, from fees and size to what a fund said it would do versus what it actually did. The goal, said Dan Hickey, a member of the research policy committee at ETF Global, is to provide support to investors overwhelmed by the proliferation of choices.“For the average investor who wants to be in stocks, buying the SPDR is a great thing,” he said. “When you get into the more esoteric products, it requires more knowledge on the part of the person buying them. There are a lot of E.T.F.’s that are troublesome.”Mr. Peterson at Ballentine said he recalled a social media fund that had only 10 stocks, five of them Chinese media companies. But he said investors also needed to examine the holdings of big players. The largest holding of the iShares MSCI Emerging Markets Index Fund, the fourth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets, is Samsung, the Korean electronics multinational. While the moves in Samsung’s stock price could help or hurt the index, Mr. Peterson said the reasons Samsung would go up or down might not be the same as the reasons that other companies in the index, which get more of their business from the growing middle class in the emerging markets, would move.“E.T.F.’s have been so successful that people have engineered E.T.F.’s that don’t follow the same functions as the original ones,” Mr. Peterson said. “Those original E.T.F.’s were broad, stock-based index-traded funds that were really efficient ways to gain core exposure to core markets.”There is nothing wrong with these advances, of course, as long as investors know what they’re getting."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/sports/football/for-bill-parcells-a-career-with-many-stops-but-one-true-home.html,"Most members of the Pro Football Hall of Fame have two or three team logos in their past, but Bill Parcells was elected Saturday with five on his résumé: coach of the Giants, the Patriots, the Jets and the Cowboys before joining the Dolphins as director of football operations.Because of Parcells’ success in leading all five to the playoffs, each of those franchises is entitled to list him as what the Hall of Fame considers a primary contributor to its history, compared with someone who had a brief secondary role.With the Giants, he earned two Super Bowl rings with victories over the Broncos after the 1986 season and the Bills after the 1990 season. His 1996 Patriots team went to the Super Bowl before he departed to the Jets as coach and chief of football operations.At the Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, N.Y., the bronze facial plaque of a player or manager features the cap of his predominant franchise. At the pro football shrine in Canton, Ohio, the bronze bust of each inductee has no helmet, no uniform, no franchise identification.But if Parcells, who has a 183-138-1 record as a coach, could select a logo for his bust, he would surely choose the Giants’ “NY.” Growing up in northern New Jersey, Parcells was a Giants fan going back to when the team played at Yankee Stadium. As a Wichita State linebacker, he was drafted by the Lions and cut, then coached at several colleges before taking over as head coach at Air Force. He moved to the Patriots as an assistant coach, then joined the Giants as a defensive coordinator in 1981 and was named head coach in 1983. His 1986 and 1990 Super Bowl teams established his Hall of Fame credentials well before his travels to the Patriots, the Jets, the Cowboys and the Dolphins.Parcells is the Giants’ 19th primary member of the Hall of Fame along with 9 secondary members. Only three teams have more primary members — the Bears with 27, the Packers with 22 and the Steelers with 20.If asked, Parcells could probably name many, if not most, of the Giants’ primary members. The honor roll includes the owners Tim Mara, who founded the Giants by buying a New York franchise for $500 in 1925, and his son Wellington, who died in 2005 after supervising the franchise for more than six decades. (The other father-son Hall of Fame members are the Steelers’ Art and Dan Rooney).Steve Owen, a two-way tackle on the champion 1927 Giants, who held their opponents to 20 points, a record low for a season, coached the Giants from 1930 to 1953, building a 155-108-17 record with two titles. He was credited with devising the A-formation offense and the umbrella defense.Two of Parcells’ linebackers in Super Bowl victories, Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson, were the most recent Giants inductees.Running back Frank Gifford, defensive back Emlen Tunnell, tackle Roosevelt Brown, defensive end Andy Robustelli, linebacker Sam Huff and quarterback Y. A. Tittle starred on some, if not most, of the Giants teams that won the 1956 championship and five divisional titles from 1958 to 1963.Old-timers will remember the eight-time All-Pro center/linebacker Mel Hein, quarterback Benny Friedman (pro football’s first pure passer), running back/kicker Ken Strong (who came over from the disbanded Staten Island Stapletons), running back Tuffy Leemans and end Red Badgro.The Giants also count Fran Tarkenton and Arnie Weinmeister among their primary Hall of Famers. Tarkenton, obtained in a trade with the Vikings, was the Giants’ quarterback in the often dismal seasons from 1967 to 1971 before returning to Minnesota. Weinmeister was an All-Pro defensive tackle from 1950 to 1953.Among the Giants’ secondary Hall of Famers, those who appeared for a season or two, are fullback Larry Csonka, end Ray Flaherty, running back Joe Guyon, tackle Fats Henry, quarterback Arnie Herber, tackle Cal Hubbard, wide receiver Don Maynard, running back Hugh McElhenny and, surely surprising to some, Jim Thorpe.Yes, that Jim Thorpe, the Sac and Fox American Indian from Oklahoma who put Carlisle (Pa.) Indian Industrial School on the college football map, won the Olympic decathlon gold medal at Stockholm in 1912, popularized pro football with the Canton Bulldogs and was a major league outfielder with baseball’s New York Giants.The first president of the N.F.L. (known as the American Professional Football Association) in 1920, Thorpe was a running back in five games for the Giants in 1925, their first season — his only Giants statistic at the Elias Sports Bureau, the N.F.L.’s record-keeper.The Giants like to include Vince Lombardi and Tom Landry on their “Giants in the Hall of Fame” list; each was an assistant coach in the 1950s who went on to be a renowned head coach, Lombardi with the Packers and Landry with the Cowboys. But the Canton shrine does not count assistant coaches on a franchise’s primary or secondary list.As for Parcells, don’t be surprised if, when nobody’s looking during his Aug. 3 induction, he slaps a Giants logo on his bronze bust."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/jobs/amber-alerts-chief-on-early-lessons-in-self-reliance.html,"I’M the oldest of six. My dad was an engineer at Xerox and started his own medical technology company on the side, which was ahead of its time and did well. When I was an adolescent, we moved from Rochester to Arizona, where he started a second company, which sold an oil-based product used in items like sinks and bathtubs.   That company failed as a result of the 1970s oil embargo.It was a difficult time for my family. I had to help with my siblings and eventually buy my own clothes and a car, but it gave me a sense of inner strength. I realized I’d always be able to take care of myself and that no job was beneath me. I also believed that no job was above me, so I didn’t put any limits on myself.In 1983 I graduated from Northern Arizona University with a degree in political science, then attended George Washington University Law School. While job-searching during my final year, I interviewed with five harried partners of a New York law firm over lunch; they peppered me with questions. When I scooped up some cantaloupe, it flew off my spoon and hit a nearby diner in the face. All five partners turned as one to look, then turned back in unison. No one said a word or even smiled. I wrote them off because they were working so hard that they’d forgotten how to laugh.After graduating in 1986, I joined a different law firm, then called Brown & Bain, working in corporate law. In 1992, my friend Anthony Bonacci and I started our own law firm, Colombo & Bonacci. I focused on corporate investment opportunities in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America. In 2000, we started another company, Axon Capital, to provide business advisory services in the United States and Latin America.We dissolved Axon Capital in 2007, and we don’t practice law anymore, either. But I’ve stayed involved in international economic development.While at Brown & Bain, I led a trade mission to bring together several United States C.E.O.’s with Carlos Salinas de Gortari, then Mexico’s president, to discuss the North American Free Trade Agreement. In the last 20 years, I’ve served in more than 10 organizations involving public policy and trade. Currently, I’m the Arizona representative to the Office of the United States Trade Representative and serve on its Intergovernmental Policy Advisory Committee.I learned about Amber Alert GPS when a friend introduced me to Russ Thornton, who founded it after his young son became lost in an amusement park for the better part of an hour. Tony Bonacci and I invested in the company, and in 2011 I became chairwoman of the parent, Alert GPS Holdings. That year, Russ asked me to become C.E.O. of Alert GPS Holdings and Amber Alert GPS so he could focus efforts on mobile applications for the company.Our global positioning device fits into a child’s backpack or is attached to his or her clothing. Parents can either log into a portal on our Web site to monitor their child’s whereabouts, or do so from a Web-enabled smartphone. Children can signal their parents by pressing an S.O.S. button on the device.The year I joined, we bought most of the assets of Amberalert.com, which included a technology called LEAP, for Law Enforcement Alerting Portal. It enables law enforcement organizations to issue  Amber Alerts when a child is missing. We provide the technology free to coordinators in participating states.Our headquarters are in Utah, but I live in Arizona and often work at home when I’m not in our corporate office. I’ve had a huge learning curve in this job because it’s in a new industry for me. It was a bit terrifying, but I realized that you can’t allow technology to intimidate. You just have to jump in, which is actually part of the fun."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/business/the-ar-15-the-most-wanted-gun-in-america.html,"PASADENA, Md.THE phone rings again at Pasadena Pawn and Gun, and a familiar question comes down the line: “Got any ARs?”The answer is no. Pasadena Pawn and Gun, a gun retailer and pawnshop 15 miles south of Baltimore, is pretty much sold out of America’s most wanted gun, the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle. Since the massacre in Newtown, Conn., in December, the AR-15, the military-style weapon that the police say was used in the shootings, has been selling fast here and across the nation.Before Newtown, the rifles sold for about $1,100, on average. Now some retailers charge twice that. At Pasadena Pawn, on the wall behind glass counters of handguns, are three dozen or so AR-15-style rifles. Dangling from nearly every one is a tag that says “Sold.”“The AR-15, it’s kind of fashionable,” says Frank Loane Sr., the proprietor. His shop has a revolving waiting list for the rifles, and a handful of people are now on it. “The young generation likes them, the assault-looking guns.”On one level, what is happening here and elsewhere simply reflects supply and demand. The gun industry has spent decades stoking demand for the AR-15 and rifles like it. Now, after the mass killings in Aurora, Colo., and Newtown, President Obama wants to reduce the supply. He has asked Congress for tougher controls, including a ban on what are commonly called “military-style assault weapons”; the Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on gun violence last Wednesday. Many enthusiasts are rushing to buy one of the rifles now, in case the president prevails.But how did gun makers stir up the demand for these particular guns in the first place? The answer is a story of shrewd advertising, aggressive marketing and savvy manufacturing — a virtual recasting of the place of guns in American life. With speed and skill, firearms manufacturers transformed a niche market for the AR-15 and similar rifles into a fast-growing profit center.When certain rifles and features were banned under federal law from 1994 to 2004, gun makers tweaked their manufacturing specifications — and introduced more AR-15-style rifles than ever. With ads celebrating the rifle’s military connections, they lured a new and eager audience to weapons that, not long ago, few serious gun enthusiasts would buy.It might seem remarkable, given the national conversation about gun control, but guns are a relatively small business in the United States. Sales of commercial guns and ammunition — as opposed to those sold to the military and police — amounted to about $5 billion in 2012. That’s less than half of the profits that Apple earned in the final 13 weeks of last year. But despite the headlines, and partly because of them, commercial gun sales are growing. Last year, they were up 16 percent industrywide, according to estimates from the National Shooting Sports Foundation, an industry trade association. Semiautomatic rifles like the AR-15 are responsible for a significant share of that growth.By now, many Americans probably recognize the AR-15, whether or not they recognize the term. Unlike its military counterpart, the M-16, the civilian AR-15 cannot spray a continuous stream of ammunition with one pull of the trigger. But, as a semiautomatic, it can fire individual bullets as fast as the trigger can be squeezed. By design, it looks and feels like something commandos might carry. That is part of its appeal, and of manufacturers’ pitch.On one level, marketing military-style weapons to civilians is not so different from pitching professional sports equipment to high-school athletes. Garry James, the senior field editor at Guns & Ammo, says a military pedigree inspires consumer confidence in a gun’s reliability.“Credibility of performance is what appeals to the firearms enthusiast,” Mr. James wrote in an e-mail.Yet marketing combat-derived weapons to civilians is a risky business, particularly now. The industry itself has promoted the guns by using battle imagery and words like “assault” and “combat.” Bushmaster Firearms, a leading maker of AR-15-style guns, and whose rifles have been used in several mass shootings, features the Bushmaster ACR, short for adaptive combat rifle, on its Web site. “Forces of opposition, bow down,” part of the site says. All the same, gun makers say customers buy these weapons with peaceable intentions.The AR-15 isn’t the first military-style weapon to gain a consumer following. After World War II, some people bought surplus German service rifles made by Mauser and repurposed them for hunting and competitive shooting. But the selling of the AR-15 represents the first mass marketing of a military-style semiautomatic rifle made by a number of different gun makers. Its success has led to an increasing militarization of the entire consumer firearms market, says Tom Diaz, a gun industry researcher and gun control advocate.“It speaks to the fact that there are a lot of young men in the U.S. who will never be in the military but feel that male compulsion to warriorhood,” says Mr. Diaz, the author of “The Last Gun,” a forthcoming book on the industry. “Owning an assault weapon is a passport to that.”A  REMINGTON MODEL 870, a classic pump-action shotgun with an all-steel receiver and walnut stock, sits on a brown gingham tablecloth along with a slice of apple pie, a mug of coffee and an issue of the Old Farmer’s Almanac.This is how guns were marketed in 1981. That year, the Remington 870 was featured on the back cover of the July issue of Guns & Ammo, in an ad that emphasized quality and durability. “The 870,” the ad read. “Still as American as apple pie.”The front cover of the same issue showed something very different: a photograph of two gleaming black rifles, with the cover line: “The New Breed of Assault Rifle.”That breed’s military antecedent, the M-16, developed by Colt, had been an American staple of the Vietnam War; soldiers had nicknamed it the “black rifle” for its anodized coating. But, by the 1980s, with the war ended and military orders waning, the industry was eager to find a market for the civilian AR-15. Many gun makers were under pressure as traditional customers like hunters were aging and young Americans were taking up other pursuits like computers and video games. Net domestic gun sales fell from more than five million guns in 1980 to fewer than four million in 1987, according to a report in 2000 from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.Some gun makers responded by advertising handguns for women. Others found success in adapting combat weapons for civilians. Colt, which had introduced an updated version of the M-16 for the military, began selling a similarly tweaked AR-15 for the consumer market. Some parts manufacturers started selling AR-15 parts to consumers who wanted to piece together their own rifles. Other companies imported semiautomatic Uzis, a version of the Israel Defense Force weapon, for civilian use.The look and the gas-powered mechanisms of the new black rifles offended some gun enthusiasts, who viewed them as mere high-powered toys. Even magazines like Guns & Ammo, the Vogue of firearms, had to acknowledge the initial wariness of some readers.“The dyed-in-the-wool deer hunter watching his domain being infiltrated by these black and gray guns assumes these ‘new generation’ hunters are merely fantasizing ‘war games’ and are playing ‘soldier,’ ” Art Blatt, a writer at Guns & Ammo, said in that 1981 issue. Mr. Blatt, now deceased, covered all types of firearms for the magazine and was himself a shotgun enthusiast.But the gun media found ways to appeal to readers. In that 1981 article on the Colt AR-15 and similar firearms, Mr. Blatt invoked the rifles’ military pedigree, “spawned in the crucible of war.” He spoke of their military-level durability, speed and accuracy. In a 1983 cover article on “Bushmaster assault systems,” he noted that in tests on a human-size silhouette target 10 yards away, a Bushmaster with a full 30-round magazine could be “rapidly emptied into the lethal zone.”The new rifles used ammunition — .223 caliber — that was considered too small for big-game hunting in most states. Before long, consumers were buying the guns for small game — “varmint hunting” — as well as recreational shooting called “plinking.”Some gun writers were not entirely comfortable with the rifles. In his article on Bushmaster, Mr. Blatt wrote that the guns seemed “a mite too powerful and penetrating” for home defense. He recommended the Bushmaster for police SWAT teams “in close-quarter encounters with evildoers.”Despite such reservations, the AR-15-style rifle — which is fast, modern, ergonomically designed, relatively easy to handle and produces little recoil — soon found a wide audience, be it Vietnam War veterans who had used the military version or first-time gun buyers.“End users with minimal firearms exposure can learn to quickly become safe and proficient with the platform regardless of prior firearms experience,” Mr. James, the editor at Guns & Ammo, wrote in an e-mail.Another feature of the AR-15 is that it can be easily personalized and accessorized.“You can take the whole gun apart and replace any part you want to without special tools, without knowing a whole lot,” says Tim McDermott, a range officer at the Personal Defense and Handgun Safety Center in Raleigh, N.C. “They are Legos for guys.”IN 1976, Richard Dyke, a Korean War veteran, bought a bankrupt gun maker in Bangor, Me., for $241,000. That business grew into Bushmaster Firearms, which quickly earned a following after target shooters began winning competitions with its rifles.“That did give us prestige,” Mr. Dyke said in an interview with The New York Times in 2011. “Then we won law-enforcement contracts and started getting recognition in the trade press.” (Mr. Dyke later sold Bushmaster and started another gun company, Windham Weaponry. He declined to comment for this article).Then, in 1994, the AR-15 hit a speed bump. Congress passed a 10-year ban on “assault weapons,” which legislators defined as semiautomatic rifles that included two or more specific features, like pistol-type handle grips and metal mounts, called bayonet lugs, to which bayonets could be attached. People who already owned such rifles were allowed to keep them.The ban made the rifles only more desirable for some consumers. To meet the demand, gun makers removed prohibited features, like bayonet lugs, and marketed them as legal alternatives.“It was unfortunately an industrywide event where companies were openly bragging about their ability to sell guns in circumvention of the law,” says Josh Sugarmann, executive director of the Violence Policy Center, a research and gun-control advocacy group in Washington.The industry produced an estimated one million modified AR-15-style rifles during the ban — more than it had produced of the original version in the previous decade — says Gary G. Mehalik, a former marketing executive at the National Shooting Sports Foundation and at Taurus USA, a handgun maker in Miami. He denied that gun makers circumvented the law.“If you drive 40 miles an hour in a 40-mile-an-hour zone, are you exploiting a loophole or following the law?” Mr. Mehalik asked.After the ban’s expiration, gun makers simply restored the once-prohibited features. Some companies added muscle to the rifles — to enthusiastic reviews in the gun media.“Scoffed at for being a ‘poodle shooter,’ the AR has grown fangs and is now available in a variety of calibers including big bores,” said an article in Guns & Ammo in 2005. “Today’s ARs ride in an increasing number of patrol cars,” the article said, adding that the guns’ military counterparts “are turning live terrorists into dead ones in Iraq and Afghanistan.”Combat allusions increased in ads as well. In a 2008 issue of Guns & Ammo, an ad for Stag Arms, a leading AR-15-style rifle and parts maker, showed a photo of two policemen wearing bulletproof vests and helmets, carrying the black rifles. “Stag Arms rifles meet the highest standards of engineering precision and reliability,” the ad said. “Just ask these guys.”An article about Stag Arms in the same issue described one of the company’s models as “a southpaw’s dream” and invoked “the role this rifle plays in combat.”Mark Malkowski, the president of Stag Arms, declined to comment.Mr. James, of Guns & Ammo, said his magazine devoted many articles to AR-15-style rifles because manufacturers over time had improved the guns and introduced a variety of accessories, thereby attracting readers’ attention.“Guns & Ammo’s role in popularizing the platform is purely a function of reader interest and the platform’s unique adaptability for a wide range of sporting purposes,” Mr. James wrote.Pressured by investors in the wake of Newtown, Cerberus Capital Management, a private investment firm that bought Bushmaster from Mr. Dyke and has built the nation’s largest gun company, the Freedom Group, announced that it would sell its gun interests. It has yet to find a buyer.A  WOMAN wearing mirrored aviator sunglasses and a make-my-day smirk aims a hefty black semiautomatic Benelli rifle at an unseen predator. “This baby handles prairie varmints or the kind that come uninvited through your door,” the Benelli Web site says of the rifle. “Chosen by the United States Marine Corps.”Gun makers seem to be competing to roll out the next civilianized combat weapon. Today, one trendsetter in handguns is a new generation of semiautomatic pistols with large-capacity magazines and other features. An ad for a pistol from Taurus USA promoted it as “the extreme-duty next-generation handgun, created for Special Operations Personnel.”Such marketing aside, the industry disavows a link between military-style guns and gun violence. Industry representatives, like the National Rifle Association, often fault news outlets for demonizing and mislabeling the rifles.“As you should know, but your non-gun-owning friends probably don’t, the guns our opponents call ‘assault weapons’ are not ‘high-powered’ when compared to other firearms,” Chris W. Cox, the executive director of the N.R.A.’s Institute for Legislative Action, wrote in a 2009 article in American Rifleman, a monthly N.R.A. publication.Some marketing executives take a different view, suggesting that the industry include warnings the way alcohol and cigarette ads do. In a blog post last month on Adage.com titled “In a Culture of Mass Shootings, the Ad Industry Shares the Blame,” David Morse, a contributor, recommended that gun makers develop “more responsible ways” to present their products.“Should we be holding manufacturers accountable?” Mr. Morse, the C.E.O. of New American Dimensions, a multicultural marketing research firm, asked in a phone interview. “The marketing messages do share in the blame because the messages are picked up and misinterpreted by the wrong kind of people.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/business/banks-at-least-had-a-friend-in-geithner.html,"TIMOTHY F. GEITHNER left the Treasury Department last week after four years as secretary. So how did he do?As financial adviser to the president in the tumultuous years immediately after the credit crisis, Mr. Geithner had immense sway over the government’s approach to all things economic. For everyday Americans, his major tasks included responding to the home foreclosure mess, unwinding federal bailouts under the Troubled Asset Relief Program and tackling the problem of financial institutions that are too big to manage and too interconnected for America’s good.But in scanning these agenda items, a pattern of winners and losers emerges. Let’s just say the financial institutions that dominate the United States were rarely on the losing end in the Geithner years.I wanted to speak with Mr. Geithner to allow him to respond to his critics and to get his take on his years in the job. A spokeswoman said he was on vacation and unavailable.So I turned to the Treasury’s Web site, where I found a list of 75 facts about Mr. Geithner’s tenure. Among other things, I learned that on his watch the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network assessed its two biggest penalties against banks for money-laundering and that the Treasury Department cracked down on offshore tax evasion. I also found he has logged more than 600,000 miles on international trips, played basketball in China and cricket in India, and has his signature on $17 billion of United States currency.Clearly, Mr. Geithner was busy. He had to deal with severe financial troubles overseas, navigate relationships with China and Europe and negotiate with Congress on contentious tax matters.Mr. Geithner has spoken to other journalists about the work that he and his colleagues did in the aftermath of the financial crisis. He said that this work “was incredibly effective for the broad interest of the economy and the financial system,” and that he believed his financial reform efforts “will significantly reduce the probability and the intensity of crises for a long period of time.” He also denied that bankers have too much political influence in Washington.That’s news to Jeff Connaughton, who was chief of staff to Ted Kaufman, a former Democratic senator from Delaware. Mr. Connaughton, author of “The Payoff: Why Wall Street Always Wins,” said he believed that Treasury’s kid-glove treatment of the big banks would have the lasting effect of ensuring future crises.While banks recovered quickly and the Dow is around 14,000, he said last week, “the economy is still sputtering for millions of Americans whose livelihoods were devastated by the financial crisis.” He added: “The legal and regulatory framework that Geithner leaves behind for preventing a future financial crisis inspires little confidence, especially amid scandals emerging almost weekly at banks too big and complex to manage, regulate, police and fail.”How did Treasury favor the banks? Consider its answer to the foreclosure mess. After promising to help four million borrowers, its Home Affordable Modification Program at last count had helped about one-quarter of that number.One reason for this is that the program was flawed from the start.First, the Treasury made the program voluntary, awarding funds to participating banks but failing to penalize those that did not. The program was all carrot, no stick.Worse, the initial plan didn’t require the banks to write down second liens they may have held — like home equity lines — from borrowers whose original loans were modified. This let the banks put their interests ahead of both borrowers and those who held the first mortgages.Unwinding the Troubled Asset Relief Program was another area where the department fell short. Eager to trumpet the success of TARP and other bailout programs, for example, Treasury boasted last spring that taxpayers would likely make money on them.Such a claim, said Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, should “immediately discredit the teller.”Treasury’s accounting for TARP and the other programs didn’t factor in the below-market rates the recipients paid on these loans. “We did them an enormous favor,” Mr. Baker said in an interview last week, “at a time when liquidity commanded an incredible premium.”Neither, critics say, was Treasury transparent about TARP or willing to provide data to Congress on the program’s progress. “Under Secretary Geithner’s leadership, Treasury consistently overstated the results of its actions, painting a rosier picture than reality,” said Senator Charles E. Grassley, the Iowa Republican who is the ranking Republican on the Senate Finance Committee. “Without the special inspector general, the public wouldn’t have a clear, numbers-driven point of view on TARP.” FINALLY, there’s the matter of Treasury’s response to the weightiest issue of all: banks that are too large to succeed.Back in 2010, Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio, and Mr. Kaufman were co-sponsors of the Safe Banking Act, which proposed placing tough limits on banks’ size. If it had passed, it would have imposed a strict 10 percent cap on any bank holding company’s share of United States deposits and set a 6 percent limit on leverage.The act was a way to begin reining in the huge institutions that had caused so much trouble in the credit debacle. It could also have protected taxpayers from having to make future rescues.A good thing for Main Street, in other words.But it was not to be. Among the bill’s most aggressive opponents was, yes, the Treasury.“We were disappointed,” Mr. Brown said in an interview on Thursday. “Not only did Treasury oppose it, but they proudly opposed it. If the Treasury had spoken out for it we could have gotten very close to winning.”Thankfully, Mr. Brown has not given up on the idea of reducing big banks’ size and threat to taxpayers. He and Senator David Vitter, a Louisiana Republican, have asked the Government Accountability Office to quantify the size of the advantages — and implied taxpayer subsidies — that large financial institutions enjoy over their smaller brethren. The study is expected to take about a year to complete.“I like Tim personally,” Mr. Brown said of Mr. Geithner. “But he was better at putting out the fire than preventing the next one.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/your-money/world-economy-is-far-from-safe-a-canadian-economist-says.html,"WHEN you see a car being driven firmly within its lane and well under the speed limit, there’s nothing to worry about.Or is there?If you’re David A. Rosenberg, the glass-half-empty economist, there most certainly is. He says the world economy is like that car. And where others see stability and recovery, he sees “a car being driven by a drunk, lurching from side to side on the road, narrowly avoiding the ditches each time.”At this particular moment, he says, the car happens to be in the middle of the road. But he can’t help but ask, “Is that because the driver has sobered up, or is it because the car is just passing through the middle on its way to the ditch on the other side?”Mr. Rosenberg isn’t certain of the answer. But despite the cheer pervading the stock market and the relatively upbeat perspective of most economists, he says he isn’t convinced that the car will remain safely out of those ditches.Formerly the chief North American economist at Merrill Lynch, and now proudly back in his native Canada as chief economist and strategist at Gluskin Sheff in Toronto, Mr. Rosenberg writes a market newsletter that is always provocative, often cantankerous and frequently out of step with the Wall Street consensus. He has been called a “permabear,” a label that he says is exaggerated but not entirely without merit.“I’d say I’m as pragmatic as possible and not locked into one position,” he says, “but I do understand that I have a much better record forecasting rain than in predicting the return of sunshine.”His record bears that out. Mr. Rosenberg correctly called the start of the last two recessions. But he was late in recognizing the strength of what has become a long bull market. In May 2009, when the stock market was in an early stage of its climb, his worries about the economy made him resolutely bearish on stocks. “I’d lock in my gains right now,” he told me then.But his clients have generally done very well if they’ve followed his cautious advice, which called for buying fixed-income securities early in the bond market’s long boom. His mantra is “safety and income at a reasonable price.”For a gimlet-eyed perspective on the current stock market joy, I called him last week and asked him what, exactly, has been propelling shares higher.His answer, in two words, was “the Fed” — the Federal Reserve and its monthly $85 billion purchases of bonds and mortgage-backed securities, which are being piled on top of a balance sheet that swelled to a gargantuan $3 trillion last week.Other analysts have pointed to a recent surge in stock mutual fund purchases by individuals, as opposed to the big institutional investors like pension funds, endowments and other money managers. The earnings season has been reasonably strong, and, at least in recent weeks, there has been no outright global economic disaster emanating from Washington, the euro zone, Tokyo or the oil fields of the Middle East.These factors are all relevant, he allows, but they pale next to the direct and powerful relationship between the growth of the Fed’s balance sheet and the stock market.The Fed’s control of short-term interest rates has always had a major impact on the markets, and the adage “Don’t fight the Fed” is a bit of Wall Street wisdom that has stood up for decades. But since the Fed lowered its benchmark Fed funds rate to near zero in December 2008, short-term rates have ceased to be a meaningful indicator because they cannot be lowered any further.Instead, to provide further monetary stimulus to the economy, the Fed has embarked on a series of quantitative-easing measures — direct purchases of financial assets.Mr. Rosenberg says his calculations show that there is now an 85 percent correlation between the growth of that Fed balance sheet and the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index. If that relationship continues — and he’s not certain that it will — the market could keep rallying, though he says he believes it’s due for a correction. On Wednesday, the Fed reiterated its pledge to keep interest rates low and to keep making asset purchases for what effectively will be many months to come.The Fed’s expansionary policies are contingent on weakness in the labor market and the overall economy. Well, the unemployment rate in January rose to 7.9 percent, the Labor Department announced on Friday. And the Fed says that as long as inflation is below 2.5 percent — and it is well below that level now — and unemployment is above 6.5 percent, it will keep rates ultralow. In addition, the gross domestic product declined at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the last quarter of 2012, the first decline recorded since 2009.MR. ROSENBERG says he does not believe that we are in a recession now but that we are very close to one. “Anemic growth is my baseline scenario,” he says. A shock could undermine the economy. And there is no assurance, of course, that the Fed can keep propping up equity asset prices.So he advises that for diversification alone, investors should keep holding onto bonds and other carefully selected fixed-income instruments; in addition, there is a great likelihood that inflation will stay low and longer-term rates will be constrained, which would be beneficial for fixed-income prices.He recommends playing the equity markets cautiously by seeking high-dividend-paying stocks of well-managed companies. At the moment, he says, those include Blackstone, the asset manager, and Merck, the drug maker, among United States stocks. And he suggests that United States citizens hedge their bets by keeping 20 percent of their assets in Canada, which, he says, is fiscally sound and is likely to have higher growth and lower inflation than its southern neighbor. He advises holding Brookfield Infrastructure, which owns and manages utilities, energy and timber assets, and Crescent Point Energy, an oil and gas exploration company.Above all else, he says, preserve your assets and your safety. Watch out for reckless behavior in the economy as well as on the roads. You never know what is about to come hurtling your way."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/jobs/maybe-a-management-job-isnt-your-style.html,"IF you asked all your friends, your family and — I regret to say — your co-workers to talk about their jobs, I think you’d conclude that there is no shortage of bad bosses in this world. Studies have shown that poor managers can cause good employees to leave and, ultimately, can seriously reduce productivity in a workplace.You can point to any number of reasons for this situation: insufficient training, poor communication, etc. But I say a bad boss is born each time someone goes into management without knowing whether he or she is truly suited to the role. When people are offered a managerial job, they may become intoxicated by the idea of more power and a bigger salary. Refusing such an offer can seem out of the question.“It’s hard to stop and think rationally when you’re being offered a promotion,” said a former client, whom I’ll call Phil. “You’re flattered. Your boss is telling you it’s a great opportunity, not to mention that it’s really good for the team and will help him a lot. Are you really going to tell him you that you’re not sure if you want it, or that you’ll need some help learning to manage the team and the new responsibilities? I don’t think so.”Phil, a sales star for a sizable Midwestern manufacturer thought it better to charge ahead and accept his promotion as head of sales for a newly formed territory, rather than to politely decline, even temporarily, or to ask his boss for more time to consider it. The risk that his boss would think that he wasn’t prepared for the job or, worse, that he didn’t want more responsibility, was too great.Move ahead a year. Phil’s effort at leading the territory proved to be a nightmare. The interpersonal dynamics, the 24/7 monitoring and a near coup in the department made him realize that he disliked managing people and had no talent for it. Maybe if his company had given him more than eight hours of management training, or had coached him through his first three to six months, he would have developed an affinity for the role. Instead, both he and the team floundered.Many newly minted leaders rarely stop to think about the enormous time commitment and learning curve as they transition from successful individual contributor to manager of a group of diverse people. They often fail to consider the demands of an expanding work schedule; the complexities of hiring, training, supervising and firing workers; or the needs to develop a vision and a tactical strategy, to create budgets or to be accountable for others’ productivity.THE lesson is this: When offered a management position, talk to your future boss, to the person you’d be replacing, to team members and to anyone else who can tell you what the job entails. Assess your strengths and limitations by scrutinizing your performance reviews and asking your boss, mentors and trusted colleagues for feedback.Reflect on your motivations, then ask yourself these questions: Do I enjoy working with people, helping them to grow and to become successful? Do I handle uncertainty well, and do I mind making decisions without knowing the entire picture? Do I communicate well, in good times and bad? Do I have the time to take this on? If your answers are yes, then you could well have the makings of a good boss.On the other hand, do you need for everyone to like you? Want immediate and constant reinforcement? Feel nervous about having legal and financial responsibilities for others? Balk at the idea of evaluating or firing someone? Then it’s possible that you’re just not cut out to be a boss.Before deciding, find out what kind of leadership training the company offers, especially if you are new to management. Will you receive training at this level and for this job? How about mentoring support along the way?If you decide to take the plunge, accept that being a great manager, or even a good one, is a learned skill. Like many talented professionals, whether N.B.A. players or opera divas, you will become successful by honing the right skills with huge amounts of practice.Remember, you don’t have to say yes. Depending on your field and your company, there are ways besides management to further your career. One thing is certain: the more you are perceived as really good at what you do, the more options you’ll have to carve out the path you want — whether in management or not."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/business/budget-sequestration-how-to-do-it-right.html,"UNLESS lawmakers act by March 1, the budget sequestration process will start cutting government spending automatically — reductions that would amount to $1.2 trillion by 2021. Congress and the White House agreed in 2011 to the sequestration, and many people see it as a kind of political gimmick.But I believe that it can turn out to be a very good thing — and that most of these cuts should proceed on schedule, though with some restructuring along the way.One common argument against letting this process run its course is a Keynesian claim — namely, that cuts or slowdowns in government spending can throw an economy into recession by lowering total demand for goods and services. Nonetheless, spending cuts of the right kind can help an economy.Half of the sequestration would apply to the military budget, an area where most cuts would probably enhance rather than damage future growth. Reducing the defense budget by about $55 billion a year, the sum at stake, would most likely mean fewer engineers and scientists inventing weaponry and more of them producing for consumers.In the short run, lower military spending would lower gross domestic product, because the workers and resources in those areas wouldn’t be immediately re-employed. Still, that wouldn’t mean lower living standards for ordinary Americans, because most military spending does not provide us with direct private consumption.To be sure, lower military spending might bring future problems, like an erosion of the nation’s long-term global influence. But then we are back to standard foreign policy questions about how much to spend on the military — and the Keynesian argument is effectively off the table.On a practical note, the military cuts would have to be defined relative to a baseline, which already specifies spending increases. So the “cuts” in the sequestration would still lead to higher nominal military spending and roughly flat inflation-adjusted spending across the next 10 years. That is hardly unilateral disarmament, given that the United States accounts for about half of global military spending. And in a time when some belt-tightening will undoubtedly be required, that seems a manageable degree of restraint.The other half of sequestration would apply to domestic discretionary spending, where the Keynesian argument against spending cuts has more force.But here, too, much of the affected spending should be cut anyhow. Farm support programs would be a major target, and most economists agree that those payments should be abolished or pared back significantly. Regulatory agencies would also lose funds, but instead of across-the-board cuts, we could give these agencies the choice of cutting their least valuable programs — or, for that matter, we could cut farm subsidies even further.Of course, much discretionary spending goes toward useful projects — building or repairing roads, for example, or research toward medical innovation. Limiting these investments would bring the Keynesian argument into play, and perhaps harm productivity, too. So we should look to substitute some areas for others — and turn to Keynesian macroeconomics for guidance.THE Keynesian argument suggests that spending cuts do the least harm in economic sectors where demand is high relative to supply. Thus, the obvious candidate for the domestic economy is health care, and the sequestration would cut many Medicare reimbursement rates by 2 percent. We could go ahead with those cuts or even deepen them, because America has had significant health care cost inflation for decades.We already have huge demand in our health care system, along with a corresponding shortage of doctors. And the coverage extension in the Affordable Care Act will add to the strain. In this setting, cutting Medicare reimbursement rates wouldn’t result in fewer health care services over all. Yes, doctors might be less keen to serve Medicare patients but might be more available for others, including the poor and the young. In the long run, the improved access for those groups would yield much return on investment, and would move the health care system closer to many of the European models.In any case, these Medicare cuts would be unlikely to bring a macroeconomic debacle, and would ease long-term fiscal pressures. We could address the shortage of doctors by removing some barriers to entry into the profession, and, in possible new legislation for immigration, easing the way for more medical professionals to come to the United States.Most generally, there is an issue of global investor perceptions. As the credit rating agencies have noted, some investors wonder whether spending cuts of any kind are possible in the nation’s current political environment. And even if the economic recovery is causing budget deficits to shrink, there are plenty of negative signals about our political ability to address longer-term fiscal concerns, which will become more severe as the population ages.Simply accepting the automatic spending cuts of the sequestration, without modification, could look like more dysfunctional politics, too. Though many of the reductions have merit, others need orderly renegotiation so the resulting cuts aren’t just necessary acts of fiscal restraint, but also net pluses for the economy."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/world/europe/iceland-prosecutor-of-bankers-sees-meager-returns.html,"REYKJAVIK, Iceland — As chief of police in a tiny fishing town for 11 years, Olafur Hauksson developed what he thought was a basic understanding of the criminal mind. The typical lawbreaker, he said, recalling his many encounters with small-time criminals, “clearly knows that he crossed the line” and generally sees “the difference between right and wrong.”Today, the burly, 48-year-old former policeman is struggling with a very different sort of suspect. Reassigned to Reykjavik, the Icelandic capital, to lead what has become one of the world’s most sweeping investigation into the bankers whose actions contributed to the global financial crisis in 2008, Mr. Hauksson now faces suspects who “are not aware of when they crossed the line” and “defend their actions every step of the way.”With the global economy still struggling to recover from the financial maelstrom five years ago, governments around the world have been criticized for largely failing to punish the bankers who were responsible for the calamity. But even here in Iceland, a country of just 320,000 that has gone after financiers with far more vigor than the United States and other countries hit by the crisis, obtaining criminal convictions has proved devilishly difficult.Public hostility toward bankers is so strong in Iceland that “it is easier to say you are dealing drugs than to say you’re a banker,” said Thorvaldur Sigurjonsson, the former head of trading for Kaupthing, a once high-flying bank that crumbled. He has been called in for questioning by Mr. Hauksson’s office but has not been charged with any wrongdoing.Yet, in the four years since the Icelandic Parliament passed a law ordering the appointment of an unnamed special prosecutor to investigate those blamed for the country’s spectacular meltdown in 2008, only a handful of bankers have been convicted.Ministers in a left-leaning coalition government elected after the crash agree that the wheels of justice have ground slowly, but they call for patience, explaining that the process must follow the law, not vengeful passions.“We are not going after people just to satisfy public anger,” said Steingrimur J. Sigfusson, Iceland’s minister of industry, a former finance minister and leader of the Left-Green Movement that is part of the governing coalition.Hordur Torfa, a popular singer-songwriter who helped organize protests that forced the previous conservative government to resign, acknowledged that “people are getting impatient” but said they needed to accept that “this is not the French Revolution. I don’t believe in taking bankers out and hanging them or shooting them.”Others are less patient. “The whole process is far too slow,” said Thorarinn Einarsson, a left-wing activist. “It only shows that ‘banksters’ can get away with doing whatever they want.”Mr. Hauksson, the special prosecutor, said he was frustrated by the slow pace but thought it vital that his office scrupulously follow legal procedure. “Revenge is not something we want as our main driver in this process. Our work must be proper today and be seen as proper in the future,” he said.Part of the difficulty in prosecuting bankers, he said, is that the law is often unclear on what constitutes a criminal offense in high finance. “Greed is not a crime,” he noted. “But the question is: where does greed lead?”Mr. Hauksson said it was often easy to show that bankers violated their own internal rules for lending and other activities, but “as in all cases involving theft or fraud, the most difficult thing is proving intent.”And there are the bankers themselves. Those who have been brought in for questioning often bristle at being asked to account for their actions. “They are not used to being questioned. These people are not used to finding themselves in this situation,” Mr. Hauksson said. They also hire expensive lawyers.The special prosecutor’s office initially had only five staff members but now has more than 100 investigators, lawyers and financial experts, and it has relocated to a big new office. It has opened about 100 cases, with more than 120 people now under investigation for possible crimes relating to an Icelandic financial sector that grew so big it dwarfed the rest of the economy.To help ease Mr. Hauksson’s task, legislators amended the law to allow investigators easy access to confidential bank information, something that previously required a court order.Parliament also voted to put the country’s prime minister at the time of the banking debacle on trial for negligence before a special tribunal. (A proposal to try his cabinet failed.) Mr. Hauksson was not involved in the case against the former leader, Geir H. Haarde, who last year was found guilty of failing to keep ministers properly informed about the 2008 crisis but was acquitted on more serious charges that could have resulted in a prison sentence.Meanwhile, an investigative commission appointed by Parliament first reported to it in April 2010 and later published a nine-volume account of the financial crash, including a study of what philosophers charged with investigating ethical issues behind the crisis called a “moral void” at the heart of Icelandic finance.Vilhjalmur Arnason, a philosophy professor at Iceland University who worked on the study, described the exercise as “very important for reasons of justice and for reconciliation” in a society traumatized by a crash so severe that it threatened to capsize the country. But, he added, bankers alone were not responsible, as “the whole society was so intoxicated” by values that put profit ahead of morality, the law and even common sense.After the crash, the new government pushed to restructure the failed banks, purging their former management and owners and prodding them to write off a big chunk of their loans to homeowners burdened with big mortgages. The government declined to bail out foreign bondholders, who lost about $85 billion. Iceland now has a growing economy.But it is not entirely clear that Iceland deserves its reputation as a warrior against Wall Street orthodoxy. In time, Iceland won praise from the International Monetary Fund for sharp cuts in spending and tax increases that slashed the government’s deficit and helped put the country back on an even keel.Certainly Iceland, in contrast to the United States and most other countries, has pursued not only little-known financiers but also many of the country’s biggest names in banking and business. “We have been aiming at the upper levels rather than the lower levels,” Mr. Hauksson said.His biggest scalp so far is that of Larus Welding, the former chief executive of Glitnir, one of the trio of banks that failed in 2008. Mr. Welding and a second former Glitnir executive were found guilty of fraud over a $70 million loan to a company that owned shares in the bank.Mr. Welding, who is now standing trial in a second case along with one of the country’s most prominent business tycoons, Jon Asgeir Johannesson, was sentenced in December to nine months in prison, six of which were suspended.The light sentence enraged many Icelanders, but, Mr. Hauksson said, “the important thing is that we got a conviction.” By contrast in Ireland, which put taxpayers on the hook for tens of billions of dollars owed by failed banks, the former chief of the failed Anglo Irish Bank has been charged with financial irregularities but so far no senior bank executive has yet been found guilty of a crime.Prosecuting bankers was never going to be easy, particularly in a country like Iceland, which is so small that nearly everybody in the capital has a friend or family member who worked at one time in finance. When Iceland’s Justice Ministry first advertised for applicants for the new post of special prosecutor, nobody responded.Mr. Hauksson, an outsider with no network of friends and relatives in Reykjavik, was then urged to apply during a second attempt to fill the post and was given the job.“I thought this was something that had to be looked into,” Mr. Hauksson said. “If we prosecute small cases we also have to look into big cases.” But, he added, this risks “opening up a Pandora’s box” that can escalate even relatively simple cases “into something very big.”The high stakes have also left some investigators vulnerable to temptation: two former members of Mr. Hauksson’s staff were placed under criminal investigation last year for selling confidential information for 30 million Icelandic krona (around $233,000) to the administrator of a bankrupt company who was trying to locate missing assets.That episode has not dented Iceland’s heroic image among antibanker campaigners abroad. Mr. Sigfusson, the minister of industry, said he was regularly invited to speak on how Iceland dealt with its banking crisis. Iceland, he said, has “no magic solution” but has managed to push through unpopular cuts in spending in part because it managed to curb public anger by pushing for the prosecution of its bankers.Today, Iceland’s bankers are both mocked for their recklessness during the boom years and reviled for pushing the country to the brink of economic ruin.Mr. Sigurjonsson, the former Kaupthing banker, said a “big umbrella of suspicion” has opened up over anybody who worked in finance and unfairly stigmatized “highly educated and very able people who can lend a hand in resurrecting the country.”He said he was shocked recently when he heard the young daughter of a friend, also a former banker, ask, “Daddy, why are bankers all criminals?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/education/edlife/the-complicated-world-of-higher-education-for-troops-and-veterans.html,"THE class was humanities, the book under discussion Mary Shelley’s “Frankenstein.” Suddenly an alarm blared and 20 students, some calm and some not, filed out of the makeshift classroom. Kandahar Airfield in southern Afghanistan was under rocket attack, again.The students, most of them uniformed troops, repaired to a cramped bunker where a few continued discussing the book. There, they waited for an hour until the all-clear sounded. Class was over. “We’ve been through so many of those that you grow callous to it,” Chief Warrant Officer Justin Hutchinson recalled via Skype. “For most of us, it was like a cigarette break.”The incident typifies the untypical world of higher education for active-duty troops and veterans. This year, more than one million service members, veterans and their families will take college courses financed with federal tax dollars. Their experiences will be more complicated than those of their fresh-faced civilian peers.As often as not, they float in and out of college like nomads, juggling deployments, families and jobs. If they are in service, they take classes at night or on weekends, studying between combat patrols and 12-hour duty schedules. If they are veterans, they are probably in their late 20s or early 30s and relearning the rules of civilian life after years of martial discipline. Some have physical injuries or mental health issues that can strain their ability to study. And with 15 years to use their post-9/11 G.I. Bill benefits, many will take their time graduating.Many will be like Mr. Hutchinson, who has been taking classes for 12 years in multiple countries and is just now nearing completion of a bachelor’s degree in cybersecurity through the University of Maryland University College, an arm of the University System of Maryland that has been educating troops on bases (and now online) under contract with the Pentagon since 1949.In Washington, questions abound about how all these students are faring. The White House went so far as to issue an executive order last year in response to reports that colleges, particularly for-profits schools, were cashing in on the G.I. Bill by aggressively marketing to veterans and not providing the support they needed to complete their studies. Last month, President Obama signed into law legislation requiring colleges to be more transparent about how they serve veterans. The call to action: provide students with better information before enrolling, and get them through once they do.It doesn’t help that figures on graduation and retention for veterans are spotty. Surveys show that a majority of colleges don’t break out the data. If they do, they don’t release it. And the government has not tracked when, or whether, military and veteran students actually graduate.“There is very little data as relates to persistence and completion for veterans,” said Bryan J. Cook, director of the Center for Policy Analysis at the American Council on Education. “The primary source of data for all students is one that looks at a small sample of first-time, full-time students, a group which most veterans do not fall into.”That may soon change. In January, the Department of Veterans Affairs announced a partnership with the National Student Clearinghouse, an independent agency, and the Student Veterans of America, an advocacy group, to collect data on veteran students. Federal agencies are also creating new metrics that reflect military and veteran students’ tendencies to attend multiple colleges and to take more than four to six years to graduate.That data is becoming more crucial as Congress enters a contentious debate this year over reducing the federal deficit, a debate that may include talk of trimming spending on veterans’ education. Since the G.I. Bill took effect in 2009, 877,000 people, mainly veterans and their dependents, have received benefits costing the government $23.7 billion. More than $10 billion is expected to be spent this year on veterans, plus about $560 million on tuition assistance for active-duty troops.So it is that Eric K. Shinseki, the secretary of veterans affairs, has been imploring veterans to “graduate, graduate, graduate,” as he recently told a conference of the Student Veterans of America in Florida. “If I sound like your dad, I am. I’m paying most of your bills.”The question remains: What works?With the flood of veterans onto campuses and online, colleges of all types — public and private, for-profit and nonprofit, virtual and brick-and-mortar — are setting up an array of services. They are hiring specialized counselors, opening centers, and offering vets-only classes. “We know institutions across the country are increasing support services,” said Meg Mitcham, director of veterans programs at the American Council on Education. “We don’t know the effectiveness of those programs and services.”Still, many initiatives have one principle at heart: that veterans have a common bond of language and experience, and sharing it can ease the transition and so improve chances of staying the course. Just as campuses provide a way station for adolescents moving into adulthood, they play a crucial role in reintegrating service members into civilian life.THE WALLS of Veteran House, the veterans residence at San Diego State University, are plastered with military memorabilia: flags from Iraq and Afghanistan beside photos of present and former residents on tour on the streets of Baghdad, Kabul and Mosul. A bulletin board is pinned with badges and braids, and above the front door hang uniforms donated by residents from every wing of the armed forces.It sits on Fraternity Row, somewhat incongruously for a house for older students “who don’t want to hang out and get drunk every night,” said Gwen Notestine, the university’s senior director of development. Six three-bedroom units overlook a courtyard draped with a camouflage net and equipped with the usual dorm paraphernalia: a barbecue, a smoker and picnic tables that have seen their fair share of both revelry and emotion.“Sometimes you’ll see two vets out here, and you’ll see that one of the guys is crying,” said Adam Goodson, 32, who is studying psychology after serving nine years in the Marine Corps. “We’ll just say: ‘Keep inside, leave those guys alone. This guy needs someone to talk to.’ ”In the common area, Thursday night is movie night, a double bill of comedy or horror, accompanied by pizza and maybe a few cans of beer. Upstairs, there’s an air hockey table, pool table and arcade machine where veterans can unwind, gradually getting used to life as a civilian.“It’s definitely nice to be around a bunch of guys who’ve been in the same situation, chewed the same dirt, been around the block,” said 24-year-old Andrew Lovick, who served for four years in the Marines. “We’re the same demographic. It’s kind of hard relating to someone who’s 18 and their parents are paying for everything. You’ve been to Afghanistan and stuff and someone’s like, ‘Oh, my God, my dad won’t pay the phone bill!’”San Diego State, in a city with one of the heaviest concentrations of veterans in the country, has one of the earliest and most extensive college programs, including special mentoring for engineering majors, veterans-only classes and, the heart of its program, an endowed center in the student services building. While the university’s data sample is small, veterans as a group seem to perform a bit better than its general population.A 2011 report by the American Council on Education, “Promising Practices in Veterans’ Education,” found that services that made veterans feel at home on campus seemed to make a difference. It cited training faculty in military culture and in identifying the symptoms of post-traumatic stress, as well as specialized academic advising and counselors to handle questions about the G.I. Bill and other federal benefits. Also important was having all this under one roof. And so campuses from Minnesota State to the University of Southern Florida to the University of Alabama have veterans centers.When students walk into San Diego’s Joan and Art Barron Veterans Center, they are immediately greeted by a veteran who can direct them to the appropriate service. The lounge is known as the Bunker, a place to play video games and to swap stories military and academic.Mr. Lovick explains the importance of a veterans community: “We try to be our brother’s keeper, just look out for each other,” he said. “Just saying, ‘Hey, have you done your homework?’ ”Travis L. Martin is a driving force behind the veterans movement at Eastern Kentucky University, whose vet population has more than doubled since 2010, to more than 1,200. A college dropout before two tours of duty in Iraq, he graduated with honors and now teaches there. As an undergraduate, he formed a student veterans organization and lobbied for better services; as a graduate student, he introduced an orientation course for incoming vets, encouraging them to write about their war experiences. He later published those essays in a journal.He is also an adviser on a program in which incoming veterans take math, English and other courses together. The program has an average retention rate of 85 percent. But such segregated courses are not for everyone, he acknowledged. “Some feel as if it will isolate them from the greater community,” he said. “Others might feel as if they need a break from military culture for a while.”Mr. Martin, 28, is working to expand a veterans studies program aimed at equipping students, vet and nonvet, with the knowledge to improve services and help with the transition. A new minor links a course he teaches, “Introduction to Veterans Studies,” with others on subjects like war in literature, and politics and terrorism. Of the 17 students in his intro course last semester, only four were veterans. The students did research projects on issues including military mental health problems, the history of obscure wars and veterans in popular culture. When the projects were done, the class opened the presentations to the entire campus.To Mr. Martin, the presentations were an example of how college can help veterans return to society, not only by making them feel at home but also by bringing them into meaningful contact with nonveterans. “I’ve learned that creating community was key for the veterans,” he said. “Those relationships will keep them in school.”JOHN L. BARBATO, 60, exemplifies the global reach of the University of Maryland University College. For 22 years, he has taught marketing and finance for the university on five continents, including four times in Afghanistan. Last spring, he taught a management course in Kandahar and gave four-day seminars at combat outposts around the country, including for a special operations team.On several occasions, he recalled, his students received cellphone calls before dashing out the door to waiting helicopters. Despite such distractions, his combat-zone students often seemed more focused than his students in Germany, where he is based. “One student told me: ‘I work 16-hour days, I walk the perimeter and I’m scared,’” he said. “‘But for three hours I get to come to your class and we talk about Walmart or McDonald’s, and it just takes my mind off of what I’m going through.”Though University College has classes on bases around the world and at its main campus outside Washington, a majority of its 50,000 military students — active-duty service members, veterans and their families — take classes online.It’s a pivotal time for the university. Some of its contracts to educate troops will be up this year. It has faced fierce competition for students from for-profit schools. And when its president stepped down unexpectedly last year amid increased spending on marketing, it raised questions. The Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions was interested particularly in whether the university was spending excessively on recruiting veterans and military, the very criticism leveled at for-profit schools. “When you are serving adults, you have to reach the adult where the adult is,” the current president, Javier Miyares, said, explaining why 7 percent of the budget goes to marketing.After a series of exchanges, the committee ended its review, apparently satisfied.The university reports a five-year graduation rate of 53 percent for military students who transferred in with at least nine credits, but it has only recently started tracking veterans’ progress.If a key to keeping veterans in school is building community, online courses face particular challenges. Without a vet center how do you foster camaraderie? How do you help with post-traumatic stress on a virtual campus?Two counselors are assigned full time to University College’s Washington campus, part of a Veterans Affairs initiative that places counselors on 32 campuses around the country.Shonda McLaughlin, who has a doctorate in rehabilitation research and education, was sitting recently in the small office she shares at University College with her fellow counselor, where she fields phone calls and e-mails about, say, applying for disability benefits or, once, finding a place to live for a temporarily homeless student. “Initially developing that rapport can be difficult,” she said. “But I believe whatever I do face to face I can do online.”Among efforts to keep students from quitting, the university offers a special orientation program for veterans. Once a month prospective and new students can get a taste of the virtual classroom to see if it’s for them. Over five days, they test-drive a course with a mock syllabus, get tips on turning in assignments and interact with counselors and other veterans. Late last year, the university added the Veterans Club, a social media site on which students can share advice among themselves.Veterans trust the advice of other veterans more than civilians’, Gregory Barber said. After 20 years in the Air Force, he should know. While deployed in the United States, Korea, England and Germany, he took courses online, on bases and at community colleges. Now 47, he is working as a military contractor and studying with University College for a master’s in cybersecurity. “A lot of veterans are afraid to go to school,” he said. “They’ve been in the military so long, they don’t know if they can do the schoolwork. It helps them to talk to veterans who have done it. It makes them think: ‘He did it. Maybe I can do it.’ ”It can be difficult for online schools to form student organizations, something experts say is critical to recreating the camaraderie of the small-unit culture of the military. Last year, the Student Veterans of America revoked charters for 26 for-profit schools, many of them online, after learning their chapters were run by administrators instead of, as required, student veterans.With online students so geographically scattered and time constrained, even the nonprofit University College struggles to get a group going. The key is a leader who will keep it vital, and University College hopes it has found that person in Mr. Barber. He has begun contacting a small group of veterans about meet-ups beginning this spring, in Washington and online. “Some veterans need a place,” he said. “They’re waiting for it.” "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/business/americans-closest-to-retirement-were-hardest-hit-by-recession.html,"Young graduates are in debt, out of work and on their parents’ couches. People in their 30s and 40s can’t afford to buy homes or have children. Retirees are earning near-zero interest on their savings.In the current listless economy, every generation has a claim to having been most injured. But the Labor Department’s latest jobs snapshot and other recent data reports present a strong case for crowning baby boomers as the greatest victims of the recession and its grim aftermath.These Americans in their 50s and early 60s — those near retirement age who do not yet have access to Medicare and Social Security — have lost the most earnings power of any age group, with their household incomes 10 percent below what they made when the recovery began three years ago, according to Sentier Research, a data analysis company.Their retirement savings and home values fell sharply at the worst possible time: just before they needed to cash out. They are supporting both aged parents and unemployed young-adult children, earning them the inauspicious nickname “Generation Squeeze.”New research suggests that they may die sooner, because their health, income security and mental well-being were battered by recession at a crucial time in their lives. A recent study by economists at Wellesley College found that people who lost their jobs in the few years before becoming eligible for Social Security lost up to three years from their life expectancy, largely because they no longer had access to affordable health care.“If I break my wrist, I lose my house,” said Susan Zimmerman, 62, a freelance writer in Cleveland, of the distress that a medical emergency would wreak upon her finances and her quality of life. None of the three part-time jobs she has cobbled together pay benefits, and she says she is counting the days until she becomes eligible for Medicare.In the meantime, Ms. Zimmerman has fashioned her own regimen of home remedies — including eating blue cheese instead of taking penicillin and consuming plenty of orange juice, red wine, coffee and whatever else the latest longevity studies recommend — to maintain her health, which she must do if she wants to continue paying the bills.“I will probably be working until I’m 100,” she said.As common as that sentiment is, the job market has been especially unkind to older workers.Unemployment rates for Americans nearing retirement are far lower than those for young people, who are recently out of school, with fewer skills and a shorter work history. But once out of a job, older workers have a much harder time finding another one. Over the last year, the average duration of unemployment for older people was 53 weeks, compared with 19 weeks for teenagers, according to the Labor Department’s jobs report released on Friday.The lengthy process is partly because older workers are more likely to have been laid off from industries that are downsizing, like manufacturing. Compared with the rest of the population, older people are also more likely to own their own homes and be less mobile than renters, who can move to new job markets.Older workers are more likely to have a disability of some sort, perhaps limiting the range of jobs that offer realistic choices. They may also be less inclined, at least initially, to take jobs that pay far less than their old positions.Displaced boomers also believe they are victims of age discrimination, because employers can easily find a young, energetic worker who will accept lower pay and who can potentially stick around for decades rather than a few years.“When you’re older, they just see gray hair and they write you off,” said Arynita Armstrong, 60, of Willis, Tex. She has been looking for work for five years since losing her job at a mortgage company. “They’re afraid to hire you, because they think you’re a health risk. You know, you might make their premiums go up. They think it’ll cost more money to invest in training you than it’s worth it because you might retire in five years.“Not that they say any of this to your face,” she added.When older workers do find re-employment, the compensation is usually not up to the level of their previous jobs, according to data from the Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.In a survey by the center of older workers who were laid off during the recession, just one in six had found another job, and half of that group had accepted pay cuts. Fourteen percent of the re-employed said the pay in their new job was less than half what they earned in their previous job.“I just say to myself: ‘Why me? What have I done to deserve this?’ ” said John Agati, 56, of Norwalk, Conn., whose last full-time job, as a merchandise buyer and product developer, ended four years ago when his employer went out of business.That position paid $90,000, and his résumé lists stints at companies like American Express, Disney and USA Networks. Since being laid off, though, he has worked a series of part-time, low-wage, temporary positions, including selling shoes at Lord & Taylor and making sales calls for a limo company.The last few years have taken a toll not only on his family’s finances, but also on his feelings of self-worth.“You just get sad,” Mr. Agati said. “I see people getting up in the morning, going out to their careers and going home. I just wish I was doing that. Some people don’t like their jobs, or they have problems with their jobs, but at least they’re working. I just wish I was in their shoes.”He said he cannot afford to go back to school, as many younger people without jobs have done. Even if he could afford it, economists say it is unclear whether older workers like him benefit much from more education.“It just doesn’t make sense to offer retraining for people 55 and older,” said Daniel Hamermesh, an economics professor at the University of Texas in Austin. “Discrimination by age, long-term unemployment, the fact that they’re now at the end of the hiring queue, the lack of time horizon just does not make it sensible to invest in them.”Many displaced older workers are taking this message to heart and leaving the labor force entirely.The share of older people applying for Social Security early spiked during the recession as people sought whatever income they could find. The penalty they will pay is permanent, as retirees who take benefits at age 62 — as Ms. Zimmerman did, to help make her mortgage payments — will receive as much as 30 percent less in each month’s check for the rest of their lives than they would if they had waited until full retirement age (66 for those born after 1942).Those not yet eligible for Social Security are increasingly applying for another, comparable kind of income support that often goes to people who expect never to work again: disability benefits. More than one in eight people in their late 50s is now on some form of federal disability insurance program, according to Mark Duggan, chairman of the department of business economics and public policy at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.The very oldest Americans, of course, were battered by some of the same ill winds that tormented those now nearing retirement, but at least the most senior were cushioned by a more readily available social safety net. More important, in a statistical twist, they may have actually benefited from the financial crisis in the most fundamental way: prolonged lives.Death rates for people over 65 have historically fallen during recessions, according to a November 2011 study by economists at the University of California, Davis. Why? The researchers argue that weak job markets push more workers into accepting relatively undesirable work at nursing homes, leading to better care for residents."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/nyregion/police-department-flouts-surveillance-guidelines-lawyers-say.html,"Civil rights lawyers have asked a federal judge to appoint an independent monitor to review the New York Police Department’s counterterrorism efforts. The lawyers said the police’s tactics have placed Muslim communities under surveillance in violation of longstanding federal court guidelines.In papers filed on Monday in Federal District Court in Manhattan, the lawyers claimed that in searching for potential terrorists, the department’s Intelligence Division has infiltrated Muslim institutions, including mosques, student associations and cafes, and retained records of what police officers and informers overheard in such locations.The surveillance has mostly focused on innocent Muslims, the lawyers claimed.“The N.Y.P.D. is continuing a massive, all-encompassing dragnet for intelligence concerning anything connected with Muslim activity through intrusive infiltration and record-keeping about all aspects of life, politics and worship,” the court filing stated. “The N.Y.P.D. operates on a theory that conservative Muslim beliefs and participation in Muslim organizations are themselves bases for investigation.”The legal motion sets the stage for a new battle in a long-running lawsuit that resulted in the Handschu agreement, named for a plaintiff, Barbara Handschu, in a 1971 lawsuit over harassment of political groups by the police’s so-called Red Squad. Over the years, the lawsuit has led to a complex and shifting set of regulations governing police investigations that intersect with political or religious activity.Following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the federal judge overseeing the regulation, Charles S. Haight Jr., relaxed a set of 1985 guidelines to give the police more latitude to seek out terrorist threats. No longer would the police have to notify an oversight panel when investigating a political group for criminal activity, as previously required.And for the purposes of detecting terrorist activities, the police were authorized to visit places and attend events on the same terms as members of the public, although they were not allowed to retain information unless relevant “to potential unlawful or terrorist activity,” according to the relaxed rules.But with Monday’s legal filing, the lawyers are seeking to convince Judge Haight that the police have ignored the regulations still in place.“The N.Y.P.D. has deceived this court and counsel, as well as the public, concerning the character and scope of its activities in violation of the guidelines,” the legal filing, signed by one of the lawyers, Paul G. Chevigny, stated.The legal motion cited a series of investigative news reports by The Associated Press and an online police columnist, Leonard Levitt, that examined the activities of a small unit within the Intelligence Division that was at one point named the Demographics Unit and later renamed the Zone Assessment Unit.The unit dispatched plainclothes officers to Muslim institutions and places of business.City police officials have defended the department’s efforts and insisted that they were not in violation of the Handschu guidelines or any civil rights laws. They disagreed with any characterization that their efforts amounted to spying or surveillance.“The N.Y.P.D. adheres to the Constitution in all it does, and specifically the Handschu guidelines in the deployment of undercover officers to help thwart plots against New York City and to identity individuals engaged in support of terrorism,” the department’s chief spokesman, Paul J. Browne, said in a statement released on Monday. “Since the destruction of the World Trade Center in 2001, terrorists have tried to attack New York City on 16 different occasions that we know of, including plots to attack everything from the Brooklyn Bridge to the Federal Reserve Bank and to kill American soldiers returning home to New York.”Last year, in a speech defending the Intelligence Division, the police commissioner, Raymond W. Kelly, said undercover investigations “begin with leads, and we go where the leads take us.”In an affidavit filed in a separate state case in January, the deputy commissioner in charge of the Intelligence Division, David Cohen, said: “It is the unbending policy of the N.Y.P.D. that information-gathering by its Intelligence Division conforms to the protections accorded by the Constitution, and the requirements imposed by law or N.Y.P.D.’s patrol guide.”He said the plainclothes officers had several goals in mind, including gaining a better understanding of ethnic neighborhoods to “identify locations where an individual radicalized to violence — coming from overseas or homegrown — might go to blend in.”The lawyers who filed the motion on Monday were given access to more than 1,200 pages of investigative reports that detail visits by Zone Assessment Unit officers to stores, cafes and other businesses.The reports, the lawyers claimed, include descriptions of conversations “mostly of a religious-political character,” as well as the ethnicity and professions of other patrons and the presence of hookahs and prayer areas."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/nyregion/turkish-authorities-seek-killer-of-tourist-from-si.html,"ISTANBUL — It was her first trip overseas, but in many ways Sarai Sierra was the epitome of a modern young tourist — alone yet constantly connected.She struck out for Turkey from New York last month, trailed by a digital horde of hundreds, who followed her online postings, and by her family, who spoke to her regularly by Skype on her iPad. She went online to rent the room where she stayed — in a rundown area of Istanbul not known to attract casual visitors.She disappeared on the day that she was to leave.The feverish search for Ms. Sierra — by the Turkish police, American investigators and, later, her husband and her brother — ended over the weekend with the grim discovery of her body alongside a busy coastal road outside the walls of Istanbul’s old city, about three and a half miles from where she was staying.By Sunday, the Turkish authorities had questioned nearly two dozen people in connection with the death of Ms. Sierra, who was 33 and lived in the Stapleton neighborhood of Staten Island. No one had been formally arrested.Istanbul’s police chief, Huseyin Capkin, told reporters that based on a preliminary examination of her body it was “certain that she was killed by a blow to her head.”Mr. Capkin dismissed reports in the Turkish press that Ms. Sierra had been acting as something other than a tourist, perhaps as a courier or a foreign agent. “She was a tourist, walking around by herself,” he said.Hundreds of Turkish police officers were said to be poring over surveillance footage taken in and around the area where her body was found. Her earrings, ring, watch and a bracelet were found on her body. The Anatolian News Agency, however, citing Turkish authorities, said on Sunday that her iPhone and iPad had not been located.Investigators were examining a blanket found nearby for signs it might have been used to move the body, which was near a pedestrian walkway.A female witness told the police late Saturday that she had spotted a woman’s hand as a middle-aged man tried to pull something out of the back seat of a white car near where Ms. Sierra’s body was found, the Anatolian News Agency reported.Ms. Sierra communicated with at least one person in Turkey before her arrival and during her stay, a man the Turkish police identified only by his first name, Taylan. The two met on the Internet and both used the photo-sharing site Instagram. Ms. Sierra, according to both Turkish and American officials, was in touch with him on the day she vanished.“I’ll be across from the Galata Tower in a while, will you come?” Ms. Sierra reportedly wrote in an e-mail sent on Jan. 21 at 11 a.m., referring to a popular tourist attraction in downtown Istanbul. The text of the message was reported in the Turkish paper Vatan.The tower is a short walk from the building in the Tarlabasi district where Ms. Sierra had rented a room.Ms. Sierra sent another message at 11:33 a.m., saying, “I’m leaving, call me if you want to reach me.”Taylan replied at 12:45 p.m., writing, “I’ll come there, hope you have wireless.”He was questioned by the police and released, according to the local reports.The State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, which has assisted the Turkish authorities in the inquiry, declined to comment on Sunday.A man who said he had rented Ms. Sierra a room, Yigit Yetmez, told the Milliyet newspaper that he had not seen her since the day before she disappeared. “She stayed alone and made advance payment for the 13-days stay over the Web site,” he said, not naming the site.It was unclear how she found the room or how she settled on one in Tarlabasi, a run-down neighborhood that has few tourist sites.Ms. Sierra’s final moments remained a painful mystery for her relatives and those who followed her movements online. As she traveled the city, making side trips to Amsterdam and Munich, she updated friends and new followers online with photographs of sunsets, train stations and minaret-filled skylines — anything that caught her eye.“I planned it on a whim, so glad that I did,” she said, commenting on an early photo from Istanbul posted to her Instagram page on Jan. 9. “Having a blast so far.”Her last photo appeared on Jan. 20, of a winding river believed to be somewhere in the Netherlands.After her death, that same collection of photos — well-done tourist shots mixed with an occasional New York City vista — became a mournful message board for hundreds of notes.Outside the family home in Staten Island on Sunday, relatives and family friends remained in a state of shock.“She lived for her sons and her husband,” said Vicki Vega, 57, a longtime friend of Ms. Sierra’s mother. “She was so loving and caring. She never treated anyone badly.”The mother of two boys, aged 9 and 11, Ms. Sierra worked part-time in a chiropractor’s office. Her husband, Steven Sierra, has said he remained in contact with her until her disappearance.Marty Tursi, the executive pastor of the International Christian Center church on Staten Island, which Ms. Sierra had attended since she was a child, said on Sunday that when other children were running and playing, she was usually talking to needy people who came to the church for food.“She was like a furnace,” Mr. Tursi said. “On the outside she seemed quiet and placid. But underneath she had this burning passion for her family, faith and photography.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/world/europe/oil-tax-forces-greeks-to-fight-winter-with-fire.html,"ATHENS — Even in the leafy northern stretches of this city, home to luxury apartment buildings, mansions with swimming pools and tennis clubs, the smell of wood smoke lingers everywhere at night.In her fourth-floor apartment here, Valy Pantelemidou, 37, a speech therapist, is, like many other Greeks, trying to save money on heating oil by using her fireplace to stay warm.Unemployment is at a record high of 26.8 percent in Greece, and many people have had their salaries and pensions cut, but those are not the main reasons so few residents here can afford heating oil. In the fall, the Greek government raised the taxes on heating oil by 450 percent.Overnight, the price of heating a small apartment for the winter shot up to about $1,900 from $1,300. “At the beginning of autumn, it was the biggest topic with all my friends: How are we going to heat our places?” said Ms. Pantelemidou, who has had to lower her fees to keep clients. “Now, when I am out walking the dog, I see people with bags picking up sticks. In this neighborhood, really.”In raising the taxes, government officials hoped not just to increase revenue but also to equalize taxes on heating oil and diesel, to cut down on the illegal practice of selling cheaper heating oil as diesel fuel. But the effort, which many Greeks dismiss as a cruel stupidity, appears to have backfired in more than one way.For one thing, the government seems to be losing money on the measure. Many Greeks, like Ms. Pantelemidou, are simply not buying any heating oil this year. Sales in the last quarter of 2012 plunged 70 percent from a year earlier, according to official figures.So while the government has collected more than $63 million in new tax revenue, it appears to have lost far more — about $190 million, according to an association of Greek oil suppliers — in revenue from sales taxes on the oil.Meanwhile, many Greeks are suffering from the cold. In one recent survey by Epaminondas Panas, who leads the statistics department at the Athens University of Economics and Business, nearly 80 percent of respondents in northern Greece said they could not afford to heat their homes properly.The return to wood burning is also taking a toll on the environment. Illegal logging in national parks is on the rise, and there are reports of late-night thefts of trees and limbs from city parks in Athens, including the disappearance of the olive tree planted where Plato is said to have gone to study in the shade.At the same time, the smoke from the burning of wood — and often just about anything else that will catch fire — has caused spikes in air pollution that worry health officials. On some nights, the smog is clearly visible above Thessaloniki, Greece’s second-largest city, and in Athens, where particulate matter has been measured at three times the normal levels.“Places that in 2008 wouldn’t even think about using their fireplaces for heating, now they are obliged to do so,” said Stefanos Sabatakakis, a health supervisor with the Hellenic Center for Disease Control and Prevention. He said the rise in pollution could cause eye irritation and headaches in the short term and far more serious problems in the long term. The air is particularly bad for asthma sufferers.The agency has asked that anyone who is lighting living-room fires just for the aesthetics give them up. It has also uploaded information on its Web site about what not to burn — anything that is painted or lacquered, for instance. But in these times, Mr. Sabatakakis acknowledged, people are not that picky.Government officials say it is too early to judge the new tax. The winter is not yet over. It has not been particularly cold, they say, and many people may have stocked up on fuel oil last season. In the north of Greece, temperatures often dip to freezing at night, while in Athens they are more likely to stay in the low 40s.“This is a very complex environment,” said Harry Theoharis, the secretary general of the Ministry of Finance, adding that many factors were affecting people’s behavior. “It is not easy to isolate and say: ‘O.K., this tax, this is the effect it had.’ ”He said there were no clear indications yet that the tax had discouraged illicit sales of heating oil as diesel, though he had detected a slight change in buying patterns that might indicate some change.It is impossible not to notice the stacks of wood for sale all over Athens this year. Not far from Ms. Pantelemidou’s place is a wood lot run by Valantis Topalis, 44, who used to own an interior design company. He started selling wood last year, eager to have a business that was not reliant on people paying their bills.Last year, he made some money. But this year, he said, everybody is selling wood — some of it stolen from national parks — and business is not so good. Even in this wealthy area, a lot of the customers come in for only 20 euros, or $27, worth of wood on colder days.“The worst part is not the lack of money,” Mr. Topalis said of his life today. “The worst part today is the mood that people are in.”Those who can afford to, like Ms. Pantelemidou, are using a combination of their fireplaces and electric heaters, unsure what this will do to their electric bills. But that is likely to bring some unpleasant surprises, as the government recently announced an increase in the cost of electricity that, depending on consumption, could be as much as 20 percent.Still, oil suppliers are glum about their prospects. Elias Bekkas, who provides oil to 65 buildings around the city, said that many of his clients had not ordered any oil, and that some who had could not pay the bill. Last winter, he said, his company sold a little more than a million gallons. This season, it has sold only about 65,000 gallons, and he doubted the total would get to 225,000.Tenant meetings to decide whether to buy oil, he said, have gotten ugly. A year ago, two buildings covered the costs for people who could not pay. But this year there is only bickering.“There is anger, bitterness between neighbors who can afford oil and those that cannot,” Mr. Bekkas said. “That is what Greece is like now.”Hes said he had detected a third class of people as well this winter. “There are those who are just making a political statement,” he said. “They are just angry about the taxes.”Ms. Pantelemidou, like many others in newer buildings, has a fireplace that was designed largely for decorative purposes. It hardly heats her living room, let alone the rest of her apartment. She has pulled a chair close to it so she can stay warm.In a working-class area of town, Aggeliki and Christos Makris are also making do without heating oil. They bought their three-bedroom apartment in 2009, when they had a combined income of $63,400 for a family of five.Since then, the salary of Mrs. Makris, 45, who works as a cleaner for the government has been cut to about $1,100 a month from $1,750 a month. Mr. Makris, 42, who runs heavy machinery at a mining company, lost all of his overtime. They are behind on their taxes and, after mortgage payments, living on less than $340 a week. To cut down on the electric bill, Mrs. Makris has even reduced the ironing she does.Paying for heating oil was out of the question. This year, Mr. Makris went north to his village to cut firewood himself. He said no one in his building wanted to buy heating oil. “The super did not even bother to ask,” said Mr. Makris. “We are all in debt.”The Makrises said they were at least lucky that they had made a good choice in upgrading the fireplace when they bought the apartment. It burns efficiently and warms much of their living space.Mr. Makris said it was far worse for the pensioners he saw, who really need central heating and do not have the strength, the energy or the money to get good firewood. Instead, they pick up scraps of wood left on the street, whether it is painted or not.“There is an old man I see at the market, and every week there is less and less in his grocery bag,” he said. “I cannot blame him, no matter what garbage he burns.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/business/united-states-and-mexico-reach-deal-on-tomato-imports.html,"The United States and Mexico have reached a tentative agreement on cross-border trade in tomatoes, narrowly averting a trade war that threatened to engulf a swath of American businesses.The agreement, reached late Saturday, raises the minimum sales price for Mexican tomatoes in the United States, aims to strengthen compliance and enforcement, and increases the types of tomatoes governed by the bilateral pact to four from one.“The draft agreement raises reference prices substantially, in some cases more than double the current reference price for certain products, and accounts for changes that have occurred in the tomato market since the signing of the original agreement,” Francisco J. Sánchez, the United States under secretary of commerce for international trade, said in a statement.The agreement will be open for public comment until Feb. 11. The Commerce Department estimated it would take effect March 4.Estimates are that nearly half of tomatoes eaten in the United States come from Mexico. Last fall Florida tomato growers asked the Commerce Department to end a 16-year-old agreement that had suspended an antidumping investigation that began in the mid-1990s. The agreement had been amended several times over the years, but Florida growers contended it set the minimum price of Mexican tomatoes so low that the Florida growers could not compete.The Florida growers said the new agreement addressed their three main concerns: pricing of Mexican tomatoes, the number of growers covered and enforcement.“We believe that the Department of Commerce and Mexico have struck a deal that meets those three tests, and we’re hopeful and optimistic that we’ll be able to compete under fair trade conditions,” Edward Beckman, president of Certified Greenhouse Farmers, a trade association, said in a statement. “Much work remains to have the agreement fully and faithfully implemented, and continuous monitoring and enforcement will be critical.”Martin Ley, a Mexican tomato producer who was on the negotiating team, said the agreement required significant concessions from the growers he represents.“Even though no dumping or injury to the U.S. industry was demonstrated by our competitors, over the last year our growers worked with our government to overhaul the whole Mexican industry, broaden the coverage and develop tough enforcement schemes,” Mr. Ley said.He said the agreement will be discussed by more than 600 Mexican growers this week. “While concessions on price will impose hardships on our industry, we are hopeful that over the long run we will be able to continue to supply the United States with what are acknowledged to be the best tomatoes in the market,” Mr. Ley said.The new agreement covers all fresh and chilled tomatoes, excluding those intended for use in processing like canning and dehydrating, and in juices, sauces and purées.It raises the basic floor price for winter tomatoes to 31 cents a pound from 21.69 cents — higher than the price the Mexicans were proposing in October — and establishes even higher prices for specialty tomatoes and tomatoes grown in controlled environments. The Mexicans have invested billions in greenhouses to grow tomatoes, while Florida tomatoes are largely picked green and treated with a gas to change their color.The Mexican and United States governments will both carry out mechanisms to increase enforcement of the new agreement.The dispute unfolded in the heated politics surrounding the presidential election, with Mexican growers charging that the Commerce Department was courting voters in the important swing state of Florida. Instead, the timing of the negotiations ensured that the government could win those votes and bring the controversy to a conclusion satisfactory to the Mexicans after the election was over.The Mexicans enlisted roughly 370 American businesses, including Wal-Mart Stores and meat and vegetable producers, to argue their cause. Those businesses feared a bitter trade war like the one the Mexicans waged over trucking, which imposed stiff tariffs on American goods headed south.If the old agreement had expired, it would effectively have led to the resumption of the antidumping investigation, and so Mexico fought hard for a new agreement, offering to substantially raise the minimum price and increase the number of Mexican growers covered by it."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/world/asia/india-approves-tougher-rape-laws.html,"NEW DELHI — India’s government on Sunday approved tough new laws to deter sexual violence against women, including the death penalty in certain rape cases, as leaders moved to respond to public outrage over a recent gang rape case in the national capital.The new package of laws, signed on Sunday by President Pranab Mukherjee after earlier approval by the cabinet, amends India’s penal code and, for the first time, will apply the death penalty to rape cases in which the victim dies. The new measures also made crimes such as voyeurism, stalking, acid attacks and the trafficking of women as punishable under criminal law.India’s coalition national government has been criticized for its clumsy handling of the protests that erupted after the brutal Dec. 16 gang rape of a young woman, who later died. The new ordinance takes effect immediately, though it must be approved by India’s Parliament within six months.Reaction has been mixed. Even as some legal advocates praised the changes as overdue, leaders of different women’s groups on Saturday held a news conference appealing to the president not to sign the measure, which they considered incomplete.“This is a piecemeal and fragmented ordinance, which seems to be more of an exercise to make an impact,” said Kirti Singh, a lawyer who specializes in women’s issues. “After 20 years of not doing anything, they seem to be in a tremendous hurry to do something or the other to appease public sentiment.”Last month, a special three-member committee led by a former Supreme Court chief justice, J. S. Verma, completed a far-reaching report that urged the government to act on a broad range of measures, including changes to criminal penalties, but also placing an emphasis on education and a holistic solution.While the new measures followed some of the recommendations by the Verma committee, others were ignored, including the panel’s call for criminal penalties in cases of marital rape, as well as the prosecution of military personnel who commit sexual assaults. In addition, the Verma committee pointedly rejected the death penalty in cases of rape.India’s cabinet approved the new measures on Friday, as leaders spoke about their desire to send a signal to the public after the New Delhi rape case. Included in the changes were provisions to improve police investigations of sex crimes, such as requiring the presence of female officers to help interview rape victims.The new provisions include varying degrees of punishment, ranging from a minimum of seven years in prison to the death penalty, in those cases where the victim dies or is left in a vegetative state. Many advocates, while welcoming some of the changes, objected to the introduction of the death penalty.“Every country is moving toward the elimination of death penalty, and India is strengthening the legislation for the death penalty,” said Kavita Srivastava, the national secretary for the People’s Union for Civil Liberties. “Here we are still looking for an eye for an eye framework.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/us/politics/obama-says-loopholes-could-factor-in-budget-deal.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama said in a televised interview on Sunday that he could foresee a budget deal in Congress that did not include further increases in tax rates but instead focused on eliminating loopholes and deductions.Mr. Obama has generally insisted that all revenue options, including higher rates, should be considered to slow the rise of federal budget deficits. But in the interview with Scott Pelley of CBS News, he said, “I don’t think the issue right now is raising rates.”Having just raised rates on people earning more than $450,000 a year, Mr. Obama said the focus now should be on targeted spending cuts and changes to the tax code, which he said favored the wealthy.“Can we close some loopholes and deductions that folks who are well connected and have a lot of accountants and lawyers can take advantage of so they end up paying lower rates than a bus driver or a cop?” Mr. Obama said in the 10-minute interview in the White House.“If you combine those things together,” Mr. Obama said, a budget deal could reduce the deficit “without raising rates again.”Still, Mr. Obama did not rule out tax increases, saying, “There’s no doubt we need additional revenue.”Republicans, having acquiesced to the tax increase in the year-end budget deal, are now insisting that further deficit reduction must come through spending cuts.Budget experts say that to raise substantial revenue through loopholes and deductions, lawmakers would have to focus on deductions on mortgage interest payments and charitable donations.Mr. Obama said the continuing fiscal crisis in Washington was to blame for the contraction in the nation’s economy in the last quarter of 2012."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/us/vast-oil-reserve-may-now-be-within-reach-and-battle-heats-up.html,"FELLOWS, Calif. — Secure in this state’s history and mythology, the venerable Midway-Sunset oil field near here keeps producing crude more than a century after Southern California’s oil boom. Many of its bobbing pump jacks are relatively short, a telltale sign of the shallowness of the wells and the ease of extracting their prize.But away from this forest of pump jacks on a flat, brown landscape, a road snakes up into nearby hills that are largely untouched — save for a handful of exploratory wells pumping oil from depths many times those of Midway-Sunset’s. These wells are tapping crude directly from what is called the Monterey Shale, which could represent the future of California’s oil industry — and a potential arena for conflict between drillers and the state’s powerful environmental interests.At one such exploratory site, tall pump jacks stood above two active wells on a small patch of federal land. For now, the operator, Venoco, has been storing the oil in two large tanks. But construction is scheduled to start soon on pipelines, and more wells are planned.Comprising two-thirds of the United States’s total estimated shale oil reserves and covering 1,750 square miles from Southern to Central California, the Monterey Shale could turn California into the nation’s top oil-producing state and yield the kind of riches that far smaller shale oil deposits have showered on North Dakota and Texas.For decades, oilmen have been unable to extricate the Monterey Shale’s crude because of its complex geological formation, which makes extraction quite expensive. But as the oil industry’s technological advances succeed in unlocking oil from increasingly difficult locations, there is heady talk that California could be in store for a new oil boom.Established companies are expanding into the Monterey Shale, while newcomers are opening offices in Bakersfield, the capital of California’s oil industry, about 40 miles east of here. With oil prices remaining high, landmen are buying up leases on federal land, sometimes bidding more than a thousand dollars an acre in auctions that used to fetch the minimum of $2.“We’ve seen a significant increase in the last three to five years in the price paid from our sales,” said Gabriel Garcia, assistant field manager at the federal Bureau of Land Management’s office in Bakersfield. “Some of that has to do with speculation on new technologies, and some of that has to do with the high price of oil.”The Monterey Shale has also galvanized California’s powerful environmental groups. They are pressing the state to strictly regulate hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, the drilling technique that has fueled the shale oil and gas boom elsewhere but has drawn opposition from many environmentalists. In December, the State Department of Conservation released a draft of fracking rules, the first step in a yearlong process to establish regulations.Severin Borenstein, a co-director of the Energy Institute at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley, said technological advances and the high price of oil were driving interest in the Monterey Shale, just as elsewhere.“Everyone has known that there is shale oil not just in the Monterey Shale but also in North Dakota and Wyoming and all over the country,” he said. “Back in the ‘70s, there were discussions that there’s all this oil and all we’ve got to do is get it. Now 40 years later, the technologies have become available to actually get it in a cost-effective way.”While oil is found less than 2,000 feet below the surface in fields like Midway-Sunset, companies must pump down to between 6,000 and 15,000 to tap shale oil in the Monterey.Though production has been declining for years, California remains the country’s fourth-largest oil-producing state, after Texas, North Dakota and Alaska. So far, little of the crude is derived from the Monterey Shale, whose untapped deposits are estimated at 15.4 billion barrels, or more than four times the reserves of the Bakken Shale in North Dakota, according to the United States Energy Information Administration.“There are billions of barrels of oil buried in the Monterey Shale, and as far as I know, nobody’s been able to find it yet,” said Neil Ormond, the president of Petroleum Land Management, a company based in Clovis, Calif. “But I think there’s going to be more people looking for it. You can’t let a few dry holes discourage the whole thing, because if you find oil, you make money.”A landman, Mr. Ormond bought leases on more than 10,000 acres of federal land in an auction organized by the Bureau of Land Management. Landmen usually work for oil companies, acquiring leases that allow them to explore and drill for oil.Landmen have also been increasingly approaching individual landowners and buying mineral rights, though these private transactions are hard to track, said Tim Kustic, California’s state oil and gas supervisor.“That’s an early precursor to an increase in exploration and drilling activity,” Mr. Kustic said.The two companies with the biggest stakes in the Monterey Shale, Occidental Petroleum and Venoco, are increasing their exploration efforts, including a joint three-dimensional seismic survey of one area.Companies with experience exploiting the Bakken Shale, including the New York-based Hess, have recently set up operations in Bakersfield, too. Jon Pepper, a spokesman for Hess, said it was “too early to talk in any definitive way” about the company’s plans in the Monterey Shale.But the oil companies’ plans for the Monterey Shale are already drawing increasing scrutiny from environmental groups. Though oil companies have engaged in fracking in California for decades, the process was only loosely monitored by state regulators.The Monterey Shale’s geological formation will require companies to engage in more intensive fracking and deeper, horizontal drilling, a dangerous prospect in a seismically active region like California, environmental groups say.Environmental groups, including the Sierra Club and the Center for Biological Diversity, are suing the Bureau of Land Management and the Department of Conservation to prevent the opening up of further land to oil exploration and to enforce stricter environmental practices.“If and when the oil companies figure out how to exploit that shale oil, California could be transformed almost overnight,” said Kassie Siegel, a lawyer at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Fracking poisons the air we breathe and the water we drink. It is one of the most, if not the most, important environmental issue in California.”Tupper Hull, a spokesman for the Western States Petroleum Association, an industry lobbying group, said oil companies had safely used fracking for decades in California, mostly combined with traditional vertical drilling.“Nobody can point to any incident or impact that has taken place,” Mr. Hull said.After the California Department of Conservation released its draft of fracking regulations, environmental groups criticized a clause that would allow companies not to disclose the chemicals used in fracking to protect trade secrets.Jason Marshall, chief deputy director of the Department of Conservation, said companies seeking to withhold such information would have to adhere to the state’s trade secret protection laws.“The baseline assumption of these regulations is the disclosure of what’s in the fluids,” he said. “It should be the exception when someone is trying to exercise a trade secret protection.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/technology/against-the-odds-starting-a-tech-business-in-france.html,"PARIS — For a young entrepreneur starting a company in Paris, Fabien Cohen could not have picked a worse time: French businesses are still recovering from the financial crisis and facing potential tax increases, and many with deep pockets have taken flight from the country.Worst of all for Mr. Cohen, many of his friends — other “start-uppers” in their 20s — have packed their bags for the more business-friendly climes of London, San Francisco and even Bangkok or Rio de Janeiro.“Everyone I know who is in his or her 20s wants to find their own experience, and that is overseas,” Mr. Cohen said. “There is a necessity to see elsewhere.”Without the means to make the jump himself, Mr. Cohen, 25, is making do. His smartphone application, Whoozer, which he likens to Circle, an app that notifies people when their friends or contacts are nearby, was set to be introduced in December but hit a technical snag a month earlier. His bank balked at putting up more money, and potential investors decided to wait on the sidelines. He could barely pay his employees last month.And yet, Mr. Cohen is making it work. He switched banks and secured a new credit line at the last minute. His fledgling company, made up of a dozen or so employees, tinkered with the business strategy and clinched a vital sponsorship to introduce Whoozer exclusively at a top French business school, ESCP Europe, on Monday. In March, they plan to introduce the service in three other business schools.“The climate is still tricky, but I’ve jumped in at the deep end,” Mr. Cohen said. “Things are still complicated in France, but that doesn’t prevent me from doing anything.”France’s business ecosystem thrives on contradictions — the country has some of the highest labor costs in Europe and restrictive regulations, and yet its companies regularly make the Fortune 500 list; it has highly skilled graduates and engineers but struggles to compete globally; it has an alphabet-soup of agencies intended to support fledgling businesses, but they are so lacking in coherence that they remain unheard of to many; there is a vibrant investor community ready to commit funds, but only once an entrepreneur has a proven track record; and the French embrace money, but not bling.The ambiguities perhaps capture well what some call France’s “Raymond Poulidor syndrome,” after a former Tour de France cyclist who never won a race but never gave up.“He was always number two. And the French really love him,” said Matthias Berahya-Lazarus, who heads Bonial, a Web service that offers localized shopping catalogs and discounts. “Likewise, the French like entrepreneurs when they remain very discreet and don’t transform into a businessman. That’s where the evil begins. So they like the number two. They don’t like success. They have a problem with wealth and with money.”Aside from the day-to-day headaches and dilemmas familiar to any entrepreneur, French businesses have their wings clipped by onerous social charges paid to the government based on the salary of the employee. Companies need to think twice before hiring and firing, when employees are often due extensive severance benefits. They also need to coax financing from a traditionally risk-averse market and console themselves with the relatively small clout that businesses hold in government.Mr. Cohen’s dogged pursuit, often accompanied with wry humor, reflects the ingenuity of French entrepreneurs in finding ways to wriggle out of predicaments.“They’ve lived under constraints for so long they’ve become quite good at that,” said Jean-David Chamboredon, who runs the French Internet entrepreneurs’ fund ISAI.But the web of regulations can also be a blessing, in the form of loopholes.One young company chief outsmarted the “system” by taking advantage of what he described as a badly coordinated tangle of benefits for job seekers wishing to create companies to pocket enough funds for his start-up.“France may not be the best place in the world to do business, but there are those who still manage to succeed,” said Antoine Angot, 28, a Web consultant in Paris and co-founder of Melty, a news Web portal that had €3 million, or $4.1 million, in revenue last year and has an audience of about 11 million. “We love our country. We accept its qualities and its flaws.”President François Hollande, who famously said he disliked rich people, moved thousands of businesspeople to leave France after introducing plans for tax overhauls aimed at high-income earners and companies in order to fill government coffers.A plan last year to raise the capital gains tax to 60 percent caused an uproar among entrepreneurs, who responded with an online protest calling themselves “Pigeons,” slang for suckers. The government backed down but said it remained committed to Mr. Hollande’s election pledge to tax capital as much as labor.Mr. Chamboredon, of the ISAI fund, also runs the Pigeons movement. He said such a tax rate would cut off vital financing to start-ups. Just the threat of it already has. In the last quarter of 2012, angel investors who provide start-up funding cut their investments nearly 40 percent from a year earlier, an ISAI survey said.“It’s a catastrophe,” Mr. Chamboredon said. “We are trying to make the government understand that this hits at the heart of financing, and especially support for the youngest start-ups. If we destroy this foundation, we destroy the ecosystem.”The Institute for Research in Economic and Fiscal Issues estimated that 5,000 entrepreneurs left France in 2012, up from the recent range of 800 to 1,000 a year. There are about 3.4 million companies registered in the country.A recent survey of 984 students ages 18 to 29 showed that one in four were in favor of going overseas to start their businesses, according to Didaxis, a consulting firm based in Paris.ApéroEntrepreneurs, a company that organizes monthly meetings for French entrepreneurs in 30 cities around the world, said it had seen an increase in the number of participants in its meetings in London, a primary stepping-stone for Parisians. There were more than 100 participants in December.“The French generally like to stay home, so when they leave people are like, ‘Whoa, what’s going on?”’ said Loïc Dumas, founder of ApéroEntrepreneurs.“We’re fighting so that entrepreneurs can stay in France,” Mr. Chamboredon said. “The majority of entrepreneurs are staying, because they have clients, networks, a market. But they are suffering. It’s frustrating that it has to come to this.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/a-death-penalty-case-in-puerto-rico.html,"Puerto Rico abolished the death penalty in 1929 and, a generation later, made it unconstitutional. The island’s Bill of Rights expressly decrees that “the death penalty shall not exist” there. But as a commonwealth of the United States, the island is subject to federal law, including the death penalty for many federal crimes.This week, in a federal court there, the Justice Department is seeking the death penalty in the trial of Lashaun Casey, who is charged with the 2005 murder of an undercover narcotics officer during a drug deal.Attorney General Eric Holder Jr. has recognized that pursuing capital punishment in jurisdictions that do not allow it in state prosecutions is a sensitive matter. In 2011, he addressed this issue in a policy memo saying that, in such instances, the federal interest must be “more substantial” than the interests of the state or local authority.The Bush administration decided to seek the death penalty against Mr. Casey because it thought he executed the officer. But of the 489 federal capital cases since 1988, when the penalty was revived for federal crimes, most have involved multiple victims or extraordinary offenses like the Oklahoma City bombing or attacks on embassies.Lawyers familiar with the case say the United States attorney’s office in Puerto Rico asked Mr. Holder to seek a life sentence without parole because there is no clear proof Mr. Casey knew the victim was a law enforcement officer.Mr. Holder, however, refused, presumably because he was unwilling to reopen the bureaucratic process that produced this decision. It is disappointing that he did not change his stance. Puerto Rico prohibits capital punishment. The facts of the case underscore just how arbitrary the death penalty is and why it should be abolished."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/world/asia/thailand-faces-a-noahs-ark-size-burden-of-wildlife-care.html,"KHAO PRATUBCHANG, Thailand — Thailand wants to shed its image as a place where many types of wildlife — turtles from Madagascar, marmoset monkeys from South America, baby sun bears, exotic birds — are for sale, an international trade driven by the global market in exotic meats and rare pets.Over the past two years, officials here have captured more than 46,000 animals from traffickers, vendors and trappers, more than double the 18,000 seized the two previous years.But now the government faces the quandary of what to do with all the creatures it has saved — a sort of Noah’s ark of endangered species, except that this ark would most likely sink under the weight of all the elephants, tigers, bears and monkeys.“The more we arrest, the more animals we have to take care of,” said Theerapat Prayurasiddhi, deputy director general of the Department of National Parks, Wildlife and Plant Conservation.While many say that porous borders, corruption and lax enforcement remain problems, the crackdown comes as Thailand is set to host a major meeting in March to discuss the main international agreement on trafficking, the United Nations Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.The burden of taking care of seized animals was underlined in October, when 16 malnourished tiger cubs were recovered from the back of a smuggler’s truck. Caretakers at the Khao Pratubchang Wildlife Breeding Center here in Ratchaburi Province have been overwhelmed by the 24-hour care and the specialized food and medicine the cubs require.“It’s like having a child — there are so many details,” said Sathit Pinkul, the head of the center. “You always have to be around when they are hungry,” he said, imitating the meow of a needy cub. “We’ve become their personal attendants.”The center houses 45 other tigers, 10 leopards and 13 other small felines known as fishing cats and Asian golden cats, which are slightly bigger than house cats but more fierce.Wildlife centers across the country are already at capacity. A center near Bangkok houses more than 400 screaming monkeys. One in Chonburi Province has 99 bears, one who has been named Airport because she was rescued from a smuggler’s suitcase at an airport. (Others have been named more randomly: Lonely, Fat, New Year.) Thai law requires that the animals be kept as evidence until legal proceedings are completed — or for five years if no suspect is arrested.Some of the animals can eventually be released into the wild, including common species of monkeys, snakes and pangolins, which resemble small armadillos and are prized in China for their meat. (Many animal parts, including rhinoceros horns, are used in traditional Chinese medicine.)But the tiger cubs, raised by humans, face life in captivity.“I’ve attended a lot of international meetings, and I’ve never heard about a tiger being successfully introduced into the wild,” Mr. Sathit said, adding, “They have less of a predatory instinct.”The cubs are likely to live out their life span of more than two decades at the wildlife center, in cages that sit among the bamboo groves. They will be down the road from 11 orangutans who were abandoned as babies on the resort island of Phuket, and a five-minute walk from the rare Fea’s muntjac deer that was shot by a hunter but is recovering and holding onto the fawn she is gestating.Not many zoos are interested in more tigers, Mr. Sathit said, and euthanasia is not considered an option.“They are living creatures like us,” Mr. Sathit said. “We must take care of them.”The center orders one ton of chicken every week from a local slaughterhouse — which sometimes runs out of meat.Feeding the birds and beasts at government centers across the country costs about 1.7 million baht, or $57,000, a month. The Department of National Parks has established a fund to help defray the cost and receives private donations, mainly from celebrities and wealthy Thais.Some animals are easier to take care of than others. Caretakers at the wildlife center in Chonburi Province do not bother to lock the cage of the slow loris, a nocturnal primate with big round eyes that lives up to its name.Monkeys are more problematic, particularly the variety known as the crab-eating macaque, which during a recent visit violently shook the bars of their cages.“The maintenance staff spends their day fixing cages,” said Thanapol Kongsapsirianand, an official at the center.Many monkeys have escaped from the Chonburi center and regularly raid the bird enclosure to steal food. They have also corrupted the pig-tailed macaques that live in the nearby jungles and taught them the finer points of burglary. “The jungle monkeys were friendly before the caged monkeys taught them bad behavior,” Mr. Thanapol said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/us/politics/borrowing-limit-raised-officially.html,"President Obama on Monday signed into law a bill raising the government’s borrowing limit, averting a default and delaying the next clash over the nation’s debt until later this year. The legislation temporarily suspends the $16.4 trillion limit on federal borrowing. Experts say that will allow the government to borrow about $450 billion to meet interest payments and other obligations. The Senate gave the bill final approval last week. The bill includes a provision attached by House Republicans that temporarily withholds lawmakers’ pay in either chamber that fails to produce a budget plan."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/business/global/japan-airlines-says-787-grounding-will-cost-it-7-5-million.html,"TOKYO — Japan Airlines said on Monday that the grounding of its Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet would cost it 700 million yen, or $7.5 million, in earnings through March and that it would seek compensation from Boeing.In making the announcement, Japan Airlines joined other Dreamliner operators, like All Nippon Airways and United Airlines, in raising the possibility of demanding compensation. That adds to Boeing’s woes as it struggles to determine why a battery aboard a parked 787 burst into flames and another emitted smoke while a plane was in the air last month.After those incidents, regulators around the world grounded all 50 Dreamliners in service. United States and Japanese officials investigating the two cases have not determined what caused the lithium-ion batteries, made by GS Yuasa of Japan, to overheat.Japan Airlines, which operates seven 787s and has placed orders for 38 more, is trying to get back on track after its emergence from bankruptcy last year and the relisting of its shares, which raised 663 billion yen.In earnings announced Monday, the airline said net profit fell 3.7 percent, to 140.6 billion yen, in the first three quarters, through December, of its fiscal year. Sales rose 3.6 percent, to 942 billion yen, but were offset by a nearly 5 percent increase in operating costs as fuel prices climbed.Japan Airlines also said that it would postpone the introduction of service between Helsinki, Finland, and Narita International Airport near Tokyo, originally scheduled to start Feb. 25. The airline cited “necessary adjustments to JAL’s international routes utilizing the Boeing 787 aircraft.”Still, it raised its full-year profit forecast through March by 16 percent, to 163 billion yen ($1.75 billion), citing strong demand in Europe, the United States and Southeast Asia.Speaking in Tokyo, Yoshiharu Ueki, president of Japan Airlines, said his company was more focused on doing all it could to help get the 787s safely back in the air. He added that the airline would begin compensation negotiations “once the situation had settled down.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/business/global/german-automakers-bet-on-us-market-and-win.html,"It was only a few years ago that some economists were arguing that Europe was “decoupling” from its long dependence on trade with the United States and predicting that the Continent’s future lay with the so-called tiger economies of Asia.German carmakers, at least, had a different vision of the future.The recovery in the United States auto market, which produced big earnings growth at Chrysler and Ford in their fourth quarters, has also been a boon for Germany’s big three — Daimler, BMW and Volkswagen.The double-digit increases in their American sales last year reflected an overall surge in demand by American buyers for European and, above all, German products. Well-designed vehicles and machinery, so coveted a Germany specialty that they can often fetch premium prices, were by far the biggest categories of European exports to the United States.As a result, overall German exports to America rose 24 percent in October from a year earlier, outpacing the 18 percent growth for euro zone exports to the United States.In many ways, the success of the German carmakers has let them invest to produce further success in the American market. The German companies are cashing in on years of commitment to the United States, which remained an important market for them even as the global auto industry trained its sights on China.Volkswagen, for example, has invested $4 billion in the United States since 2008, building a factory in Chattanooga, Tenn., that began churning out Passat sedans in 2011.“Five years ago, we reset the clock here in America,” Martin Winterkorn, the chief executive of Volkswagen, said in Detroit last month. “The Passat was made in America for America.”BMW and Daimler’s Mercedes-Benz unit have been making sport-utility vehicles and other autos in America since the 1990s: BMW in Spartanburg, S.C., and Mercedes in Tuscaloosa, Ala.That presence put them in position to take advantage of the revival of the American market.Nearly a third of the vehicles that BMW sells in America are built in that country, according to LMC Automotive, a research firm in Troy, Mich. Mercedes and VW both produce about a quarter of what they sell in the United States in local factories.BMW and Mercedes have also expanded their appeal in the United States by moving carefully into more affordable parts of the market. Mercedes, for example, sells an entry-level Mercedes sedan for less than $30,000.All of that has contributed to a sales surge. BMW vehicle sales in the United States rose 14 percent last year, including the Mini brand; sales of Daimler’s Mercedes and Smart brands increased more than 15 percent; and Volkswagen’s sales soared 34 percent, including Audi brand cars.For Mercedes and VW, those were better growth rates than in China, and they helped to offset slower sales there.The German automakers’ strong financial results contrast with those of European rivals like Renault and PSA Peugeot Citroën, which abandoned the United States market decades ago. Now the French carmakers are short of ways to counterbalance the stricken European market. It is probably too late for them to re-enter the United States, even if they could afford the cost of re-establishing a dealership network.Mercedes and VW are so well placed in the United States that they even did a little strutting during the televised Super Bowl football championship on Sunday, showing splashy commercials.In the Mercedes spot, the actor Willem Dafoe, playing the devil, offers a young man a new CLA sedan in exchange for his soul. After a fantasy sequence in which the young man cuddles with the model Kate Upton, dances alongside Usher and overtakes Formula One cars on a racetrack, he sees a billboard advertising the CLA for $29,900. He realizes he can afford one without the devil’s help.The euro zone recession would clearly be much worse than it is without the income that European companies are bringing in from the United States. While Germany has been the main beneficiary, accounting for 40 percent of euro zone exports to the United States, countries including France, Italy and Spain also recorded big gains in sales in America of products that span categories from chemicals to wine.Britain, which is in the European Union but not the euro zone, expanded exports to America by 11 percent in October from a month earlier. That made Britain second to Germany in total sales of goods to the United States that month, with about 4 billion euros, or $5.4 billion, in October versus 8 billion euros for Germany, according to official figures.The renaissance of United States demand is a big shift from a few years ago, when all the action seemed to be in Asia. The realignment has prompted some companies and governments to re-examine their priorities, and it helps explain why European Union leaders like Angela Merkel of Germany and David Cameron of Britain have been pushing hard for a new trade agreement between Europe and the United States. A deal would eliminate tariffs and harmonize regulatory requirements for cars and other products.America has always been important to German manufacturers.But the recent pickup in United States demand for factory equipment, which is closely linked to the auto industry as well as natural gas exploration and chemical production, came as a surprise.After past economic downturns, United States demand for machinery never fully recovered to precrisis levels, said Peter Leibinger, vice chairman of Trumpf, a company based in Ditzingen, Germany, that makes machines used to cut and form sheet metal.“It was always a step down,” Mr. Leibinger said by telephone from Farmington, Conn., where a Trumpf factory employs about 700 people.But this time it was different. After an initial plunge following the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, Trumpf’s American sales have soared, rising about 90 percent to 274 million euros from June 2010 to June 2012.The German carmakers are benefiting from a general recovery in the premium end of the American market, as well as from more aggressive financing incentives. But they are also in position to meet demand for less expensive models, as with the BMW X3 SUV, which starts at about $39,000.Volkswagen, which only a few years ago flirted with irrelevance in the United States, has come back after a campaign that began in 2008 and included a high-tech makeover of the buildings that house Audi dealerships as well as efforts to improve service.The Passat made in Tennessee is less costly and simpler than the European version. It has helped VW compete better in the United States with the Toyota Camry and Honda Accord.“The VW brand has historically had more of a cult following,” said Jeff Schuster, senior vice president at LMC Automotive. “The new Passat is larger and more in line with midsize cars in the U.S. It has more mass appeal than cult appeal.”VW has also invested heavily in marketing in the United States. The company’s Super Bowl spot portrayed an office worker from Minnesota speaking in a Jamaican patois and exhorting his dour co-drones to “turn the frown the other way around.” Then he took them for a ride in a red Beetle. The slogan is: “Get In. Get Happy.” (Some commentators said the commercial was culturally insensitive, but Jamaica’s tourism minister liked it, The Associated Press reported.)Mr. Schuster said he thought VW sales would continue to grow this year, though perhaps not as fast. In January, sales of the German brands rose less than the American car market over all, although it was not clear if the relatively poor performance was a trend or an anomaly. Over all, vehicle sales in the United States were up 14 percent in January from a year earlier. Mercedes sales rose 11 percent over that period, VW and Audi unit sales rose 7 percent, and BMW and Mini sales were up only 2 percent.BMW sales were held back by a shortage of products because of heavy demand last year, a spokesman said, adding that the company expected 2013 to be a good year in the United States.Despite all the talk about Asia in recent years, there is palpable relief among German exporters that the United States is once again a growth market. America remains an easier place for European companies to do business than most emerging markets.“To us, it’s a market like Germany,” said Mr. Leibinger of Trumpf. “We consider China a huge opportunity, but we do see the risks there.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/business/manufacturing-orders-up-with-demand-for-aircraft.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Orders to American factories increased in December even though companies trimmed their orders for goods that signal investment plans.Factory orders rose 1.8 percent in December compared with November, when orders had fallen 0.3 percent, the Commerce Department said Monday.But demand for core capital goods, a category considered a proxy for business investment plans, fell 0.3 percent in December after strong gains of 3.3 percent in November and 3 percent in October.Orders for durable goods, items expected to last at least three years, rose 4.3 percent, slightly below the 4.6 percent estimated in a preliminary report. The increase reflected strong gains for military and civilian aircraft.Orders for nondurable goods like petroleum products, chemicals and paper, declined 0.3 percent in December after a 1 percent drop in November. The weakness reflected declines in petroleum products, a drop that was related to declines in energy prices during the month.For the year, total factory orders rose 3 percent to $5.66 trillion. This reflected a slowing in the manufacturing sector after an 11.8 percent rise in orders in 2011. Demand for investment goods fell 0.3 percent to $759.4 billion.For December, orders for commercial airplanes rose 10.1 percent and demand for military aircraft increased 56.4 percent. Orders for motor vehicles and parts dropped 1.2 percent. Demand for machinery fell 1.1 percent, but orders for computers and other electronic products rose 4.1 percent.The overall economy actually contracted in the October-to-December quarter at an annual rate of 0.1 percent, the first negative reading since the recession was ending in the summer 2009. The decline reflected a big drop in military spending, slower business stockpiling and a fall in exports.But other parts of the economy showed strength, including housing and business investment on equipment and software, which rose at an annual rate of 12.4 percent, the best showing in more than a year and a rebound from a decline in business investment in the July-to-September quarter.In another sign that the economy could be strengthening, the Institute for Supply Management reported that manufacturing grew at a faster pace in January, driven by an increase in new orders and more hiring at factories.The institute’s manufacturing index rose to 53.1 from 50.2 in December. It was the highest reading since April."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/business/global/producer-prices-fall-in-euro-zone.html,"BRUSSELS — Euro zone factory prices fell for the second month in a row in December, mirroring the trend in consumer inflation and leaving room for a possible European Central Bank interest rate cut to revive the weak economy.Prices at factory gates in the 17 countries using the euro fell 0.2 percent in December from November, the E.U.’s statistics office, Eurostat, said on Monday.Prices fell by the same margin in November. Compared to the same month a year ago, the producer price index was up 2.1 percent in December. Annual consumer inflation was 2.0 percent in January, close to the E.C.B.’s target of below 2 percent.The E.C.B.’s governing council kept rates at 0.75 percent at its January meeting and will discuss rate policy again on Thursday. The decision to keep policy on hold last month was unanimous, but economists are divided over the E.C.B.’s future moves.“The E.C.B. is unlikely to change policy stance” in February, analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note. “But we expect the tone of the press statement to turn more cautious on the economic outlook and more relaxed on the outlook for inflation,” the bank said, referring to the E.C.B.’s explanation for its decision on rates delivered to the media.Both consumer and factory inflation were driven up last year by high world oil prices and tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which further pushed up the cost of energy.Lower world oil prices have since helped cut the cost of energy for industry and households in the euro zone. Brent crude came down from $120 a barrel in August to trade around $110 a barrel towards the end of 2012.Brent crude was around $116 a barrel on Monday, on signs of improving economic growth in the United States and China.Last year’s cooler prices were reflected in the euro zone’s producer prices in December. Energy prices dropped 0.8 percent, the third straight month of decline, and by the same margin as in November."

It would be the first such federal action against a credit-rating agency related to the recent financial crisis.Chevron and Wal-Mart were among the biggest drags on the Dow Jones industrial average after analysts downgraded the companies, and all 10 S.& P. 500 sectors were lower. The losses came after Friday’s market climb that left the S.& P. 500 at a five-year high and the Dow above 14,000.“The market is extended and due for a pullback. I think people are looking for an excuse to make sales,” said Michael James, a senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.Spanish and Italian bond yields rose, renewing worries about the euro zone’s sovereign debt crisis. Spain’s prime minister faced calls to resign over a corruption scandal, while an inquiry of contended misconduct involving an Italian bank was expected to widen three weeks before a national election.Adding to market pressure, data from the Commerce Department showed factory orders for December were below economists’ expectations.The Dow Jones industrial average was down 129.71 points, or 0.93 percent, at 13,880.08. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index declined 17.46 points, or 1.15 percent, to 1,495.71.The Nasdaq composite index lost 47.93 points, or 1.51 percent, to 3,131.17.With 18.7 billion shares traded, it was the busiest day on record for McGraw-Hill shares.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/nyregion/celebrating-ed-koch-a-civic-savior-of-new-york.html,"After the eulogies by a mayor and a former president, after the loving references to “Uncle Eddie” by a 17-year-old grandnephew, after the coffin had been lifted on the shoulders of the Police Department’s ceremonial unit, the 10,000-pipe organ in Temple Emanu-El played a piece that is not usually heard at a funeral, but that seemed singularly appropriate for the funeral of Edward I. Koch: “New York, New York.”The song was written by John Kander and Fred Ebb in 1977, the year Mr. Koch was elected mayor, and as his coffin was carried down the center aisle and the organ swelled from pianissimo to full-fledged forte, the mourners broke into applause for the city’s 105th mayor. Mr. Koch died at 88 on Friday.“No mayor, I think, has ever embodied the spirit of New York City like he did,” Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg told the mourners, “and I don’t think anyone ever will. Tough and loud, brash and irreverent, full of humor and chutzpah — he was our city’s quintessential mayor.”In the pews was a Who’s Who of the New York that Mr. Koch led for three terms — and the New York he commented on in the 23 years after he left office. The congregation was part familiar names, part lesser knowns who had worked in government, and part onetime adversaries who had tangled with Mr. Koch but seemed to have patched things up.Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Mr. Koch had been so angry when he advised the mayor not to run for a fourth term in 1989 that Mr. Koch endorsed Mr. Schumer’s opponent, Alfonse M. D’Amato, an incumbent and a Republican, in 1998. As things turned out, Mr. Koch lost the Democratic primary to David N. Dinkins, who went on to defeat Rudolph W. Giuliani in the November election, and Mr. Schumer beat Mr. D’Amato.“I invited him to my swearing-in, and I said, ‘Let’s let bygones be bygones,’ ” Mr. Schumer said, “and we’ve been friends ever since.”Mr. Dinkins attended the service, as did former Mayor Giuliani, who as the United States attorney in Manhattan in the 1980s had pursued corruption cases that shook the Koch administration. But Mr. Koch was never implicated, and James F. Gill, a lawyer at a firm Mr. Koch joined after he was mayor, said Mr. Koch’s “most cherished possession was his reputation for honesty and integrity.”Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo and former President Bill Clinton chatted after the service. What they said is unknown, because reporters could not hear them. But as they parted, Mr. Cuomo, who was housing secretary in the Clinton administration, said, “Nice to see you, Bill.”He put out his hand, saying, “Tell Hillary I said hello.” Hillary Rodham Clinton, who stepped down as secretary of state last week, is widely seen as a possible Democratic presidential candidate in 2016. So is Mr. Cuomo.Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, said that Mr. Koch had frequently offered her advice, but that “at the end of every conversation he would say, ‘Just do what you want, and if people don’t like it, just bleep ’em.’ ”Former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who lost to Mr. Koch in the 1977 mayoral voting but defeated him five years later in the Democratic primary for governor, also attended the service, as did former Gov. George E. Pataki, the Republican who defeated the elder Mr. Cuomo in 1994.Mr. Koch was remembered for his life before City Hall — as a congressman from Manhattan — and for his life after, as a movie reviewer, author and political gadfly. Some in the crowd seemed surprised that the service lasted little more than an hour.“We were told not to speak long,” Mr. Clinton said. He held up a bundle of papers as if it were the text of the eulogy he was about to give.He assured the mourners it was not. “These are the letters I got from Ed Koch when I was president,” he said, recalling advice Mr. Koch had given him, solicited and unsolicited, on domestic issues like gun control and on foreign policy.“He had a big brain,” Mr. Clinton said, “but he had a bigger heart.”Mr. Bloomberg said Mr. Koch had rescued the spirit of the city after its brush with bankruptcy and the disastrous summer of 1977, with the Son of Sam shootings and a blackout that was followed by looting. Mr. Bloomberg said that by the time he got into politics years later, Mr. Koch was ready with advice, drawing laughter at one example.“I remember the time we were talking about how to tackle obesity, and he said, ‘Limit the size of sugary drinks, no one will notice.’ ” (Mr. Bloomberg’s restrictions on large sodas, set to take effect next month, have aroused outrage in some quarters and are being challenged in court by the soft-drink industry.)Several of Mr. Koch’s relatives — the children and grandchildren of his sister, Pat Koch Thaler — delivered tributes, offering a glimpse of the private side of a public figure.Noah Thaler, Mr. Koch’s grandnephew, recalled a devoted uncle who had attended youngsters’ school events and soccer games, family holiday dinners, a Cirque du Soleil performance (where, he said, they ran into Mr. Clinton, and his proud Uncle Eddie bragged about him), even a manicure last year with Mr. Koch’s grandniece Hannah.Other relatives marveled at Mr. Koch’s ability to walk into one of their apartments, lie down on a couch and fall asleep instantly — and to wake up just as fast.“While he knew he was often portrayed as a lonely bachelor, it didn’t matter,” Mr. Thaler said. “He saw in his family only perfection.”Mr. Koch was buried at Trinity Church Cemetery in northern Manhattan. He chose it so that he would not have to leave Manhattan. “Just think about it: a Polish Jew in an Episcopal graveyard in a largely Dominican neighborhood,” Mr. Bloomberg said. “What could be more New York — or even more Ed Koch?”After the service, the coffin was lifted into a hearse on Fifth Avenue, which was closed, as were side streets near Temple Emanu-El.“The ultimate New York tribute — a traffic jam,” said Randall Bourscheidt, who was the deputy commissioner of cultural affairs in the Koch administration."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/opinion/invitation-to-a-dialogue-fighting-poverty.html," To the Editor:Nicholas D. Kristof is clearly right: Too many young children from poor families face diminished opportunities by the time they’re just 2 years old, and we should do more to help them overcome the formidable obstacles before them (“For Obama’s New Term, Start Here,” column, Jan. 24). But his portrayal of today’s safety net deserves a broader look.Noting that the “official” poverty rate is no lower today than in the late 1960s, Mr. Kristof said our anti-poverty programs largely address symptoms of poverty without reducing poverty itself.But the official poverty measure considers only cash income in determining whether a family is poor. It counts cash welfare payments, which have fallen dramatically since the late 1960s, but not benefits like food stamps and the earned-income tax credit, which provide much more assistance now than then.The government’s more comprehensive poverty measure that counts these other benefits shows that safety-net programs now cut the number of poor people nearly in half — by more than 40 million — compared with where the nation would be without these programs.Moreover, numerous studies show that key safety-net programs do more than reduce poverty. Children who had access to food stamps in early childhood were healthier as adults. Medicaid coverage is associated with better health, lower mortality and less household debt. The earned-income tax credit substantially increases work among poor single parents and leads to improvement in children’s school performance.Still, as Mr. Kristof argues, for too many poor families, existing programs aren’t sufficient. Unfortunately, there’s no silver bullet. So we should move aggressively to identify, test and evaluate a variety of new approaches and to institute and spread effective initiatives, to help more poor children advance and poor adults surmount barriers to success in the labor market. But as we do so, we shouldn’t lose sight of the safety net’s considerable accomplishments or the progress that has been made.ROBERT GREENSTEINWashington, Feb. 4, 2013The writer is president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.Editors’ Note: We invite readers to respond by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/world/americas/firm-denies-deception-in-big-check-tied-to-iran.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela — When German customs agents at the Düsseldorf airport found a check for the equivalent of nearly $70 million in Venezuelan currency in the carry-on bag of a former Iranian economy minister last month, it seemed like the elements of an international thriller.But an Iranian construction company contended on Tuesday that the reality was much more mundane: the money, it said, was meant to pay wages and buy concrete and other materials as part of a project to build 10,000 apartments in Venezuela.“They’re buildings, not bombs, not missiles,” said a lawyer for the company, Kayson Venezuela, mocking speculation here that the company’s construction projects were a front for more sinister activities.The lawyer, interviewed at the company’s offices in Caracas, refused to give his name, citing company policy.The unusual courier was Tahmaseb Mazaheri, a former Iranian economy minister and Central Bank governor, according to the lawyer and a second employee, Khosro Mobasser, the company’s director of Latin American business development.They said Mr. Mazaheri was bringing the check to Venezuela as a favor to the company, which is owned by Kayson, a large Iranian construction company.Venezuela, a major oil supplier to the United States, has developed close ties with Iran, a fellow OPEC member, in defiance of efforts by the United States and its allies to isolate Iran over fears that it is seeking to develop nuclear weapons.German customs authorities said last Friday in a statement that customs officials had seized the check written in the amount of 300 million Bolívars, the Venezuelan currency. They said the check was found in a carry-on bag of a 59-year-old Iranian man arriving from Iran via Turkey.Travelers entering Germany are required to declare to the authorities if they are carrying currency in excess of 10,000 euros, whether in cash, checks or other instruments. The statement said the man said he had less than that amount. It said that the check, which was worth almost 54 million euros, was seized and that the authorities initiated misdemeanor proceedings against the man, whom it did not identify.The episode became big news in Venezuela this week after a Berlin newspaper, Bild am Sonntag, published an article on Sunday identifying Mr. Mazaheri as the courier.Kayson has been working under contract with the Venezuelan government since 2006, building apartments. It has completed 10,008 and is now building an additional 10,000 units, the lawyer said.Mr. Mobasser said that payments from the Venezuelan government for the construction projects are deposited in an account at the Bank of Venezuela. He said that the only people authorized to write checks on that account are at the company’s offices in Tehran.The lawyer said that each month, the company sends a budget to the home office, which sends back a check for the required amount. Money is then deposited in another account used to pay construction costs.The lawyer said the company routinely sent the checks with an employee or other person traveling to Venezuela. He said Mr. Mazaheri did not work for Kayson.Venezuela keeps its currency artificially overvalued, with an official exchange rate of 4.3 Bolívars to the dollar. The black market exchange rate, which is a better measure of the currency’s real value, is at about 19 Bolívars to the dollar, according to Web sites that track the currency.The lawyer said that Mr. Mazaheri had since returned to Iran and that the company would have to send another check to cover expenses. But he said that there was nothing illegal about how it sent the checks and that it would continue to operate in the same way.“DHL isn’t going to bring it for me,” he said. “FedEx isn’t going to bring it. How else are you going to do it?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/world/europe/georgias-ivanishvili-sees-warming-with-russia.html,"TBILISI, Georgia — As Russia took steps to resume imports of Georgian-produced wine and mineral water, Georgia’s new prime minister, the billionaire Bidzina Ivanishvili, said Tuesday that he was making progress on one of his campaign promises — to repair the country’s badly frayed relationship with its huge neighbor.Mr. Ivanishvili has struggled to meet the expectations that swept him to power in October, ending the nine-year political dominance of President Mikheil Saakashvili and his party. Many voters expected his election to be followed by immediate financial relief and a turnaround in relations with Russia.On Monday came the news that Russia would dispatch teams of sanitary inspectors to Georgia in anticipation of resuming imports. Georgian wine and mineral water — Russian consumer staples since the Soviet era — were banned from Russian shelves in 2006, as Mr. Saakashvili openly challenged Russia’s supremacy in the region. At a news conference marking his first 100 days in office on Tuesday, Mr. Ivanishvili said he was making headway in repairing the rift.“It will not happen as fast as I used to say,” he said. But he said that he felt a friendly tone was returning to the relationship, and that Russian officials had given him “a surprisingly warm reception” at the recent World Economic Forum in Davos.Mr. Saakashvili and his allies have warned that Mr. Ivanishvili’s overtures may represent a departure from Georgia’s longstanding efforts to join NATO and the European Union, which still have strong public support. Late last month, legislators from Mr. Saakashvili’s United National Movement proposed amending the country’s Constitution to make Georgia’s “pro-Western orientation” legally binding.Mr. Ivanishvili said Tuesday that he would not amend the Constitution, but that altering the country’s pro-Western foreign policy was “unimaginable.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/global/kfc-parent-suffers-after-china-scandal.html,"LOS ANGELES — KFC’s parent, Yum Brands, has warned that it expects 2013 earnings to shrink rather than grow as it struggles to manage a food safety scare in China and expects no return to growth in restaurant sales there until the fourth quarter.Shares of Yum, a fast-food chain operator based in Louisville, Kentucky, fell 5.6 percent in after-hours trading Monday as Wall Street analysts and investors received the disappointing news. The company has been widely seen as a model for how a foreign company can do business in the complex Chinese market.“This is going to take all the experts they have in public relations to stem the tide,” said Jack Russo, an analyst at the investment firm Edward Jones. “I don’t think anyone saw this coming.”Overall fourth-quarter net income at Yum, which also operates the Pizza Hut and Taco Bell chains, fell to $337 million, or 72 cents per share, from $356 million, or 75 cents per share, in the same period a year earlier. Excluding special items, Yum had a profit of 83 cents per share. That topped analysts’ average estimate by a penny, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Total revenue rose to $4.15 billion from $4.11 billion.Yum reported a 6 percent drop in fourth-quarter sales at established restaurants in China because of “adverse publicity” regarding chemical residue found in some of its chicken supply.Its China business continued to suffer in January, when same-store sales — revenue from stores open for at least a year — dropped 37 percent, including a 41 percent decline for KFC and a 15 percent decline for Pizza Hut Casual Dining.Yum said the January data had probably affected by the timing of the Lunar New Year, which fell in January last year. The weeklong holiday period, which is in February this year, typically increases sales at restaurants and other tourist-related sectors.Still, Yum expects same-store sales in China to be down 25 percent for its financial first quarter for China operations, which includes only the full months of January and February. It said KFC same-store sales in China should perk up by the fourth quarter.As a result, Yum forecast a “mid-single-digit” percentage decline in earnings per share for 2013. Yum had forecast growth this year in earnings per share of at least 10 percent, and analysts polled by Thomson Reuters  I/B/E/S had expected the same.Yum has nearly 5,300 restaurants in China, mostly KFC locations, and the country accounts for more half its sales and 40 percent of total operating profit. Its strong reputation for high food quality helped it grow briskly in a country that has been rocked by serious and persistent food safety scandals.Yum’s China sales first took a hit in mid-December, when government food safety agencies began investigating the company’s supply chain. The investigations were prompted by a report on China Central Television that found that two of Yum’s suppliers in China had purchased chickens from farmers who used excessive levels of antibiotics in their animals. Yum stopped using one of those suppliers and cut purchases from a problematic plant used by the other.Although the company was not fined by the Chinese food safety authorities, it has suffered a widespread backlash in the mainstream news media and on microblogs.A concern for Yum is that its other branded stores in China — including Pizza Hut, Little Sheep hot pot eateries and East Dawning Chinese fast food — may be tarnished by the KFC scandal. In early January, Yum apologized to customers in China over its handling of the food scare. On Monday, it said it would begin an aggressive marketing campaign after the Lunar New Year, which starts Feb. 10, to restore KFC’s brand image.The company would do well to shake off all corporate “hubris” and fall on its sword, said the branding expert Robert Passikoff, president of Brand Keys. “If your same-store sales are down by more than one-third, something’s not working,” Mr. Passikoff said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/opinion/standard-poors-stands-accused.html,"The financial crisis could never have happened without the credit-ratings agencies issuing stellar ratings on toxic mortgage securities that inflated the bubble. Before the Justice Department filed civil fraud charges this week against Standard & Poor’s, the nation’s largest credit-ratings agency, it seemed as if the entire ratings industry — which reaped record profits in the boom years — was going to escape, unrepentant and unpunished. That may now change.But the underlying problem — a lack of proper regulation of the industry — remains unresolved. Nearly three years after the passage of the Dodd-Frank financial reform law, there is no sign that federal regulators are willing to propose, let alone finalize, tough rules to reform the agencies. Worse, regulators have repeatedly asserted legal positions that shield the agencies from investor lawsuits, despite questions of misrepresentation, negligence and fraud in the rating of mortgage investments.Still, the suit against S.&P. and its parent, McGraw-Hill Companies, is a move toward accountability. It alleges that, from September 2004 through October 2007, S.&P. “knowingly and with the intent to defraud, devised, participated in, and executed a scheme to defraud investors” in certain mortgage-related securities, and that the agency falsely represented that its ratings “were objective, independent, uninfluenced by any conflicts of interest.”What sets the case apart is that the government brought the case rather than water down a settlement to suit S.&P.’s demands. The government originally sought a penalty in excess of $1 billion and an admission to a least one count of fraud. When S.&P. balked, the government sued and now is seeking a $5 billion penalty. Too often, the government has accepted settlements with fines that are too small compared with the harm done and allowed the defendants to neither admit nor deny the charges.The Justice Department brought the case not under federal securities law, which has proved difficult to apply, but under a 1989 banking law intended to protect taxpayers from frauds against federally insured financial institutions. The government faces a lower burden of proof when the victims are federally insured banks, and, in contrast to private securities’ lawsuits, can quickly issue subpoenas to gather more evidence. This is the sort of aggressive legal theorizing that has been missing in the government’s approach to potential civil and criminal cases stemming from the financial crisis.For many years, the ratings agencies have defended themselves in civil lawsuits by private parties by saying that their ratings are independent opinions, protected by the First Amendment. A court ruling has found that the questionable ratings are not opinions, but misrepresentations. The government’s case will benefit from that view. By charging S.&P. with violating its own standards in issuing top ratings for trashy securities, the government has lifted the allegations out of the realm of shoddy practices and into the realm of fraud — where they belong."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/technology/kpn-to-raise-4-billion-euros-to-fend-off-rivals.html,"BERLIN — KPN, the former Dutch telephone monopoly now partly owned by the Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim Helú, said on Tuesday that it would nearly double its financial reserves in an effort to fend off competition in the Netherlands, Germany and Belgium.The operator, based in The Hague, said it would sell €4 billion, or $5.4 billion, in new shares as it reported a €162 million loss for the fourth quarter, compared with a €176 million profit a year earlier.Will Draper, an analyst in London with Espirito Santo, a Portuguese investment bank, said KPN’s financial distress had been partially self-inflicted.The Dutch company, under pressure from domestic and international institutional shareholders, had paid out about €2 billion a year to shareholders through generous dividends and share buybacks since 2000, Mr. Draper said, a far greater percentage of its sales than those of its larger rivals, Deutsche Telekom and Vodafone.KPN also spent heavily to connect more than 18 percent of Dutch households to high-speed optical fiber networks. Those payouts reduced KPN’s financial maneuverability, Mr. Draper said, and the situation grew critical in December when KPN paid €1.4 billion to obtain broadcast spectrum for high-speed fourth-generation mobile services.“KPN’s big problem is that it has basically underinvested in its own business,” Mr. Draper said. “Now it is paying the price.”KPN’s market value before its announcement Tuesday was €4.7 billion, and the rights offering, to take place later this spring, would expand its resources by 85 percent.Eric Hageman, the chief financial officer at KPN, said the company’s policies of generous payouts to shareholders were justified but could have been curtailed sooner as the operator’s profitability began to fall in 2009 and regulatory changes cut into its main sources of income, like roaming fees and mobile interconnection charges.“It’s always easier when you’re on the gravy train, so to speak, and times are good, but it is difficult from a management perspective to change that,” Mr. Hageman said during an interview. KPN suspended its share buyback program in January 2012 and said  Tuesday that it would not pay a dividend for 2012.The Dutch company’s predicament is a test for Mr. Slim, the patriarch of the Mexican family that owns the Latin American mobile operator group América Móvil, which acquired a 28 percent stake in the operator last year. Since América Móvil acquired its stake at €8 a share, KPN’s share price has fallen by more than half. The shares closed Tuesday at €3.45, down 15.9 percent.During a conference call Tuesday with investors, Eelco Blok, the KPN chief executive, said América Móvil had not yet decided whether it would purchase new shares in the offering, which would be made to existing shareholders. América Móvil can purchase a proportionate 28 percent of the new shares sold, but could also theoretically increase its stake beyond that level by acquiring stock from other shareholders who might opt out of the stock sale.Mr. Draper, the Espirito Santo analyst, said that KPN’s financial distress would test Mr. Slim’s interest in the Dutch operator. When he bought the stake last year, Mr. Slim spoke generally of a 10-year commitment to KPN.During the same year, América Móvil bought a 23 percent stake in Telekom Austria. Mr. Slim also owns 7 percent of The New York Times Co.“So far, he has taken a bath on KPN shares,” Mr. Draper said. “So this will be a test of his engagement in the company.”Mr. Hageman, the chief financial officer, said KPN had the “strong belief” that América Móvil would approve management’s request for the rights offering at a shareholders’ meeting on March 19.Frank Jansen, a spokesman at Citigate, América Móvil’s public relations firm in Amsterdam, said it had no immediate comment on its plans for the stock sale.The cash infusion is the latest defensive move by KPN, once an arm of the Dutch postal service, which remains the landline market leader but has faced rising wireless competition from rivals Vodafone and T-Mobile, a Deutsche Telekom unit, as well as from the Dutch cable  television operators Ziggo and UPC, which also sell broadband and voice-over-Internet services.In Germany, KPN’s investment plans will weigh on the carrier’s midterm profitability, said Thorsten Dirks, the chief executive of the KPN operator E-Plus, the fourth-largest mobile operator in Germany, with a 16 percent share of the market. In 2012, KPN had explored a potential fusion of E-Plus with the No.3 operator, O2 Germany, owned by the Spanish company Telefónica, but those talks were not productive and were ended, Mr. Dirks said in a conference call.“This capital increase, which all companies make at some point, is intended to reduce our net debt and to allow us to further invest and give us the financial flexibility to keep pace in the Netherlands, Belgium and Germany, all markets that are currently going through radical changes,” he said."

The S.& P. 500 rose 5 percent last month.Lance Roberts, chief economist at Streettalk Advisors in Houston, said that strength was related more to the Federal Reserve’s commitment to keep money cheap than to companies’ performance. If earnings are beating estimates, he said, it’s largely because expectations were so low.“If you lower the hurdles enough, companies can get over them,” Mr. Roberts said.The fact that individual investors are starting to return to stocks, as they have in recent weeks, is another sign that the market is due for a correction, Mr. Roberts and other analysts have said.The McGraw-Hill Companies, parent of the Standard & Poor’s ratings agency, fell $5.38, or 10.7 percent, to $44.92, after the federal government sued S.& P.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/global/japanese-central-bank-chief-to-step-down-early.html,"TOKYO — The governor of the Japanese central bank, Masaaki Shirakawa, said on Tuesday that he had offered to step down on March 19, three weeks before the end of his term, under intense government pressure on the bank to take bolder steps to resuscitate the deflationary economy.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is expected to replace Mr. Shirakawa, who has long preached caution on monetary policy, with a successor who is more open to printing money, stoking inflation and bringing an end to the falling prices that have weighed on Japan.During his five-year term, Mr. Shirakawa resisted calls from successive governments to be more aggressive, warning that loose money would only lead to unchecked government spending and runaway inflation. Mr. Shirakawa also argued that the government, not the Bank of Japan, needed to do more to encourage economic growth through structural reforms and other growth policies.Since late last year, Mr. Abe has taken the bank to task, singling out its tepid monetary policies as the root of Japan’s economic woes. He successfully campaigned on a bolder monetary agenda ahead of nationwide elections in December, arguing that the central bank needed to set an inflation target of 2 to 3 percent. The strategy resulted in a decisive victory for his Liberal Democratic Party.Markets cheered Mr. Abe’s monetary drive. The Nikkei 225-share index has surged almost 30 percent since mid-November, and the yen has weakened by 15 percent, an advantage for Japanese exporters.Mr. Shirakawa has found it increasingly difficult to hold his ground. In January, the bank agreed to issue a rare joint statement with the government that laid out a target for 2 percent inflation. It also agreed to pursue unlimited monetary easing through an asset purchase program until that target was met. Japan has been enduring deflation, or falling prices, since the late 1990s.But some economists have said that Mr. Shirakawa’s policies remained too timid and that unless the Bank of Japan were even more aggressive, 2 percent inflation would prove to be an elusive target. The bank needed to expand its asset purchase program, now at about 101 trillion yen, or about $1.01 trillion, by a much bigger amount, the economists have said, and needed to step up its purchases of a wider range of assets including longer-term government bonds.“After three five-year terms of dyed-in-the-wool conservatives, the Bank of Japan is finally likely to have a governor who is prepared to use the monetary armory at his disposal,” Nicholas Smith, Japan strategist at CLSA Asia-Pacific Markets, said in a note.Even using tougher language than the soft-spoken Mr. Shirakawa would help, Mr. Smith said. “The more you do with threatening rhetoric, the less you have to do with real money,” he said.Speaking to reporters Tuesday, Mr. Shirakawa explained that he had offered to step down early to time his departure from the bank with those of his two deputies, whose terms end March 19.“I told the prime minister that I will resign on March 19 so that a structure with a new governor and two deputy governors can start simultaneously,” Mr. Shirakawa said after a meeting of the government’s top economic council. He said that Mr. Abe, who led the council meeting, had “listened carefully,” but it was unclear late Tuesday whether the prime minister would agree to an early departure.Names circulated in the Japanese news media as possible candidates to succeed Mr. Shirakawa include the former economy minister Heizo Takenaka; the former Bank of Japan deputy governors Kazumasa Iwata and Toshiro Muto; the Asian Development Bank president, Haruhiko Kuroda; and the University of Tokyo economist Takatoshi Ito."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/economy/ism-reports-slower-growth-at-services-companies.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Growth at service companies slowed slightly in January as a result of weaker new orders and slower business activity. But hiring improved, providing a bright sign for the economy.The Institute for Supply Management said Tuesday that its index of nonmanufacturing activity dipped to 55.2 in January. That was down from 55.7 in December, which was the highest level in nearly a year. Any reading above 50 indicates expansion.The modest decline from December’s strong reading suggests the industry was not greatly hampered by an increase in Social Security taxes that reduced take-home pay for most Americans.Companies did not single out the rise in payroll taxes in the survey, Anthony S. Nieves, chairman of the I.S.M.’s survey committee, said in a conference call with reporters.The report measures growth in industries that cover 90 percent of the work force, including retailing, construction, health care and financial services.Over all, economists were encouraged by the steady reading in the services index, as well as a sharp jump in the institute’s January manufacturing index released last week. The reports suggest economic growth is rebounding in the quarter from January to March, after shrinking from October to December.A gauge of hiring in the services report rose to its highest level in nearly seven years. That was consistent with the solid job gains reported by retailers, construction companies and other service firms in the government’s January employment report, released last week.Service and construction companies have added an average of nearly 195,000 jobs a month in the last three months. The increase in the employment gauge suggests the solid hiring will continue.Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, attributed the dip in the overall I.S.M. index to the Social Security tax increase. “But this blow has been small and cushioned by stronger demand in other sectors, namely construction,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/nyregion/first-part-of-hurricane-sandy-aid-is-to-be-released.html,"Federal officials plan on Wednesday to release the first installment of a nearly $51 billion emergency aid package to help millions of victims of Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast.That installment will total $5.4 billion, with New York City receiving $1.77 billion; New York State, $1.71 billion; New Jersey, $1.82 billion; and Connecticut, Maryland and Rhode Island splitting the rest, Senator Charles E. Schumer said.A formal announcement is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday on Staten Island, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg expected to be joined by Shaun Donovan, the Obama administration’s housing secretary, among others.“With this initial allocation, the work it took to pass the Sandy aid bill is starting to pay off,” Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said. “We know there is desperate need and anxious waiting in the places hit by the storm. We will be making sure that this money gets to homeowners, small businesses and communities as quickly as possible.”The disbursement will come a week after Congress gave final approval to the aid package, following a heated and prolonged battle. Indeed, Mr. Donovan said in an interview that the allocation, which usually takes up to 60 days, was the fastest in history.“The president has made clear to me and all of us across the administration that we have to move as quickly as we possibly can to get these funds to families and communities that are still struggling,” he said. “But we also have to do it with great transparency and accountability.”The House had initially declined to act on the bill amid objections from fiscal conservatives over its size and its impact on the federal deficit. But Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, among others, criticized his fellow Republicans for impeding an emergency response that, in past disasters like Hurricane Katrina, had much faster federal action.In the end, Congress did pass the $51 billion package, largely along party lines, supplementing a $10 billion measure that had been approved earlier and that primarily addressed flood insurance.The money being announced on Wednesday will come in the form of Community Development Block Grants, which are the biggest component of the aid package and are intended to give localities more flexibility in allocating resources. Next to individual assistance grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which are much smaller in size, these block grants are the most direct form of aid for people and businesses hurt by a natural disaster.The state and city are now drafting formal plans to be submitted in the next couple of weeks to the federal government detailing how they intend to spend the money. But the plans are likely to include awards to homeowners to repair and renovate homes and reimburse business owners who sustained heavy losses."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/global/arcelormittal-announcing-loss-indicates-no-further-plant-closures-in-europe.html,"LONDON — ArcelorMittal, the world’s largest steel company, appeared to draw the line on additional European plant closures Wednesday, even as it announced a $4 billion net loss for the fourth quarter of 2012 and a $3.7 billion net loss for the year.But the company’s results also highlighted just how bad operating conditions in Europe have been. A key reason for the losses was $5 billion in write-downs, almost all of it on its European businesses.ArcelorMittal continues to be badly hurt by its operations in Europe, where it employs 98,000 people and where demand for steel has dropped by 30 percent since 2007, including a 9 percent decline in 2012. The company reported a $2.9 billion operating loss for the quarter in its European unit which supplies the beleaguered automobile industry.Lakshmi N. Mittal, the company’s chairman and chief executive, said during a conference call with analysts Wednesday that he expected steel shipments to increase this year by 2 percent to 3 percent. That, he said, was because of growing demand for steel in China, Brazil and the United States, where the oil and gas industry, as well as auto and heavy equipment makers, were proving strong markets for ArcelorMittal’s products.Unlike in Europe, he said that U.S. “businesses are getting loans.” He added that he expected Europe to remain in recession this year, but that this would be “far less severe than in 2012.”Although ArcelorMittal is bidding on a steel plant being sold to the German steel maker ThyssenKrupp in Alabama, the company is mainly focusing on its new investments in mining, which has been more profitable than steel making of late, recording $1.2 billion in operating profit and a 22 percent operating margin last year.The company announced Wednesday that the board had approved a big expansion and modernization of its iron ore mine in Liberia, part of a $4 billion effort to nearly double global iron ore production. The company’s iron ore output is likely to rise by 20 percent in 2013 as enlargement of its Canadian mines is completed, the company said.Mr. Mittal said 2012 had turned out worse than expected, particularly in Europe and China, taking the industry by surprise.“Production was not adjusted quickly enough, leading to oversupply and weak pricing,” he said, adding that steel prices were down 8.2 percent in 2012 from 2011.Mr. Mittal created his company through a long series of acquisitions that culminated in an epic takeover battle for Arcelor, based in Luxembourg, in 2006. At the time it looked as if he had succeeded in achieving sufficient consolidation of the fragmented industry to make it highly profitable.But conditions have been brutal since the financial crisis hit in 2008, with steel demand shrinking in Europe and North America, where ArcelorMittal has much of its operations. A large portion of the write-downs last year were noncash good will on European units acquired through the Arcelor merger.The weak European economy “led to a downward revision of cash flow expectations” from these businesses, the company said.Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie Securities in London, wrote in a recent research note that the company made close to $43 billion in investments, including takeovers, from 2006 through 2011, whereas the company’s market value is now only about $28 billion. He said those figures raised questions about whether ArcelorMittal “will be able to generate shareholder value gains and sufficient returns from its investment projects.”He also said that they raised “the question of whether the steel industry is capable of generating shareholder value” over the long term.Mr. Largey wrote in an e-mail on Wednesday that he saw “a modest uplift in earnings for 2013” for ArcelorMittal, but that the steel industry remained hampered by “overcapacity and lackluster real demand, particularly in Europe.”The difficult economic conditions have forced Mr. Mittal to take a knife to his operations, especially in Europe, where the company produces about 45 percent of its steel. ArcelorMittal previously announced the long-term idling of blast furnaces at Florange, France, various facilities in Liège, Belgium, and electric arc mills in Spain and Luxembourg as part of what it called its “asset optimization” program, which is designed to achieve $1 billion in annual savings.The idlings and closures led to tensions with labor unions and a showdown with the government of President François Hollande of France over the closure at Florange, which employs 2,000 workers. The French government threatened to nationalize the facility before ArcelorMittal agreed to invest €180 million, or $234 million, in the site, though it indicated that the two blast furnaces would remain closed.“We have had to deal with the negative reactions of many stakeholders during implementation, but steps we have taken have been essential, “ Mr. Mittal said Wednesday.Aditya Mittal, the company’s chief financial officer and Mr. Mittal’s son, said ArcelorMittal did not “expect any further restructuring in Europe.” There will be further financial charges as the reorganization progresses, Aditya Mittal said.Despite the company’s struggles, which have included downgrades of its debt to junk status, ArcelorMittal is still able to raise money in the markets. Last month it raised $4 billion through an offering of shares and convertible notes in an effort to reduce net debt, which it forecast would be $17 billion in June, down from $21.8 billion at the end of the year."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/global/monte-dei-paschi-di-siena-admits-985-million-in-losses-from-secret-deals.html,"FRANKFURT — Monte dei Paschi di Siena, an ancient Tuscan bank whose troubles have shaken Italian politics and caused jitters around the euro zone, on Wednesday confirmed earlier estimates of losses from a series of secret transactions that were used to conceal the scope of the bank’s problems.The bank said its losses from three questionable transactions were 730 million euros (about $985 million), only slightly higher than an estimate in October of a loss of 720 million euros. The disclosure Wednesday, after a meeting of the bank’s board that lasted into the evening, could calm financial markets if investors conclude that all of the bank’s skeletons are out of the closet.The disclosure came as Italian prosecutors said on Wednesday they had ordered the seizure of assets worth about 40 million euros in connection with possible fraud against Monte dei Paschi, Reuters reported. Prosecutors did not give details, but Italian news organizations reported that the money was seized from other banks that did business with Monte dei Paschi.Problems at Monte dei Paschi, founded in 1472 and commonly known as M.P.S., have rippled far beyond the medieval Tuscan city of Siena, which is also the bank’s largest shareholder.Former Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi has seized on the scandal as an issue as he tries to make a political comeback.The timing of the scandal has been inopportune for Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, raising questions about his supervision of Italian banks when he was governor of the Bank of Italy, the Italian central bank.The Bank of Italy has insisted that it subjected M.P.S. to intense scrutiny. Last week the central bank issued a detailed account of the numerous steps it took since 2008 to force Monte dei Paschi to raise capital, install new management and deal with risks stemming from its holdings of Italian bonds, which were declining in value.Some managers withheld critical information about the questionable trades that came to light only recently, the Bank of Italy said.But at the least the case of Monte dei Paschi has illustrated the limits of bank supervision, and called into question whether the central bank would be able to do a better job than national supervisors at keeping an eye on banks.Mr. Draghi is likely to face many questions about Monti dei Paschi when the central bank holds its regular monthly news conference on Thursday.The problems at M.P.S., which led to a 3.9 billion euro ($5.3 billion) bailout by the Italian government, have also led to criminal investigations.Prosecutors in Siena on Wednesday heard testimony from Antonio Vigni, former chief executive of Monte dei Paschi and one of several previous managers being investigated on a series of charges including false accounting and fraud. Giuseppe Mussari, the bank’s former president, will also be heard this week.The bank’s troubles stem in part from the 9 billion euro ($12 billion) purchase of Antonveneta bank in 2008, just months after the Spanish bank Santander had bought it for 6.6 billion euros ($8.1 billion). The Siena magistrates are also looking into allegations of bribery related to that deal.Investigations have branched out to other Italian cities, including Trani, in Sicily, where prosecutors are looking closely at derivatives operations carried out by Monte dei Paschi and other Italian banks as well as the role of the regulatory bodies entrusted with monitoring those banks."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/trade-group-lawsuit-challenges-olive-oil-labeling.html,"The North American Olive Oil Association, a trade group that represents the olive oil business in the United States and Canada, is suing Kangadis Food, saying it falsely labeled its Capatriti brand as olive oil when the product is a fat from leftover olive skins and pits.That fat, known as olive pomace oil or olive residue oil, is extracted using high heat and chemical solvents including hexane. “Olive pomace oil is not allowed in any grade of olive oil under any standard anywhere in the world,” said Eryn Balch, executive vice president of the association. In addition, she said, “The cost of producing oil that way is a fraction of what it costs to produce authentic olive oil.”Themis Kangadis, an executive with the company, said he had not heard of the lawsuit and would ask the company’s lawyers to look into it. “I had no idea,” Mr. Kangadis said.The lawsuit seeks to prevent Kangadis, which is based in Hauppage, N.Y., and operates under the name The Gourmet Factory, from selling any pomace product that is not so labeled and to notify retailers and other buyers of pomace products that they were buying an adulterated product. The suit was filed on Wednesday in United States District Court for the Southern District of New York.Ms. Balch said Capatriti’s price was one-third to one-half that of competitive brands, so the association hired an independent contractor to buy nine tins of Capatriti “100% Pure Olive Oil” product from three lots. Identifying materials were removed from the samples, and they were shipped to a lab in Spain that is certified by the International Olive Council, an organization based in Spain that sets the standards for olive oil purity and quality.“When the results came back, they clearly confirmed that none of the samples were olive oil,” Ms. Balch said. “Instead, they were some type of pomace oil and pomace oil and seed oils.”Dan Flynn, executive director of the Olive Center at the University of California, Davis, said he was not surprised to hear of the lawsuit. “There have been too many reports that the grading and labeling of olive oil are a big problem,” Mr. Flynn said.Other studies by the center on olive oils sold in supermarkets and used in the food service industry have found that many failed to meet the standards of the grade listed on their labels.In 1982, the Food and Drug Administration defined “virgin olive oil” as a term that may be used on labels only for oil from the first “pressing” of olives and fit for consumption without further processing. “Oil extracted from olive pomace and pits by chemical means and refined to make it edible must be labeled either ‘refined olive residue oil’ or ‘refined extracted olive residue oil,’ ” according to the agency’s regulations.More recently, the Agriculture Department has published voluntary guidelines for grading olive oil. New York State has more stringent laws than the federal government, stating that any compound or blended olive oil be labeled as such and include the percentage of olive oil that is in the total.Diluting olive oils with seed and other oils has been a persistent problem, attracting growing consumer complaints, as has the grading of extra virgin olive oil.“Information about hazelnut, walnut and other seed oils being in olive oils has been misrepresented in the press,” Ms. Balch said. “Most of what has been talked about lately is not about authenticity. It’s about labeling within a grade, whether something is really extra virgin or not.”In the complaint against Capatriti, the association said that because of the differences in the way olive oil and pomace were produced, the presence of pomace in a single tin meant that all tins in the same lot contained pomace. Capatriti bottles and cans are labeled “Extra Virgin Olive Oil,” “100% Pure Olive Oil” and “Light Olive Oil.” Its Web site says it is “proud to introduce” a new line of “All Natural Blended Olive Oil.”“This is a very, very clear-cut case of false advertising,” said Timothy J. Treanor, a lawyer at Sidley Austin who is representing the association. “This is not a case where there is room for argument about degrees of truthfulness. Here, 100 percent olive oil is what it states on the tin and by any standard, that’s not true.”The association contends that Kangadis had to have known about the adulteration of its products because of a complaint it filed after the Connecticut General Assembly in 2008 adopted the criteria set by the International Olive Council for assessing olive oil quality and set penalties for companies that sell olive oils cut with hazelnut, soy or peanut oils.Kangadis tried to stop the Connecticut Department of Consumer Protection from enforcing the state’s law on olive oil, saying the company’s “reputation and business relationships have already been harmed by adoption of the state olive oil standards.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/daily-stock-market-activity.html,"Stocks were flat on Wall Street on Wednesday as the latest round of earnings reports failed to give investors an impetus to push the market’s recent rally forward.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 7.22 points to close at 13,986.52, after trading slightly lower for most of the day. The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 0.83 points, to 1,512.12. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 3.10 points, to 3,168.48.Time Warner shares rose $2.05, or 4.1 percent, to $52.01 after the company said its net income rose 51 percent in the last three months of 2012 despite largely unchanged revenue. Marathon Oil fell 32 cents, or 0.9 percent, to $34.40 after its fourth-quarter net income fell 41 percent on higher exploration costs and taxes.Stocks are consolidating their gains after surging since the start of the year. The Dow closed above 14,000 on Friday for the first time since December 2007 and had its best January in almost two decades. The index is up 6.7 percent this year, and the broader S.& P. 500 is up 6 percent.“There’s no question that we need to take a pause and let reality catch up,” said Jim Russell, an investment director at U.S. Bank.The rally started when lawmakers reached a last-minute deal on New Year’s Day to avoid a series of steep tax increases and spending cuts that would have kicked in at the beginning of the year. The gains have continued on optimism that the housing market recovery is gaining momentum and the job market is healing.While the budget deal reached in January dealt with tax increases, it did not tackle spending cuts.Automatic cuts to everything from military spending to popular benefit programs were scheduled to take effect Jan. 1, but were postponed until March 1. Mr. Russell said stocks were unlikely to rise strongly while talks heat up in Washington over the spending cuts, which are also referred to as sequestration.The rally has pushed stocks close to nominal record levels. The Dow is 178 points off its milestone close in October 2007, and the S.& P. is 53 points below the high it achieved in the same month.“We’ve had a really nice move up here. Whether we graduate to the next level, I think, is questionable,” said Ben Schwartz, chief market strategist at Lightspeed Financial. “We’re looking for something to spark it.”More than half of the companies in the S.& P. 500 have reported earnings for the fourth quarter, and analysts expect earnings for the period to rise 6 percent, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That would put earnings growth on track to increase for the third consecutive quarter after slowing to 0.81 percent in the second quarter of 2012.As investors have become more comfortable holding riskier assets like stocks, they have reduced their holdings in defensive investments like United States government bonds, sending yields on those bonds higher.The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which moves inversely to its price, has risen more than 20 basis points since the start of the year and is trading close to its highest level since April. On Wednesday, the price of the 10-year note rose 11/32, to 97, while its yield fell to 1.96 percent, from 2.01 percent late Tuesday."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/profound-weight-of-layoffs-seen-in-survey.html,"Layoffs have touched nearly every American household in some fashion over the last few years, according to new survey data to be released Thursday by the John J. Heldrich Center for Workforce Development at Rutgers University.While about 8 percent of Americans are unemployed, nearly a quarter of Americans say they were laid off at some point during the recession or afterward, according to the survey. More broadly, nearly eight in 10 say they know someone in their circle of family and friends who has lost a job.“This to me is why the recession was so all-consuming and is likely to influence the American psyche,” said Cliff Zukin, a public policy and political science professor at Rutgers and co-author of the report. “Almost everyone, four out of five, were directly or one step removed from unemployment and all that goes with it financially, socially, psychologically.”The survey presented a bleak view of the economic future.A majority of Americans say they think it will be at least six years before the economy is made whole again, if ever. Three in 10 said the economy would never fully recover from the Great Recession.“Despite significant improvements in the nation’s labor market, American workers’ concerns about unemployment, the job market, job security and the future of the economy have not changed much since we conducted a similar survey in August 2010,” the report said.Just a third of Americans surveyed in this poll, conducted from Jan. 9-16, said they thought the economy would be better next year, the same share that said so two years earlier.Of those laid off in recent years, nearly a quarter said they still had not found a job. Re-employment rates for older workers have been particularly bad, with nearly two-thirds of unemployed people 55 and older saying they actively sought a job for more than a year before finding one or had still not found work.Not surprisingly, those who are unemployed are especially downbeat about many economic issues in addition to their own finances. Of those who were jobless and looking for work, 31 percent said their jobless benefits had run out and 58 percent said they were concerned their benefits would run out before they found work.Of those who have found work, nearly half say their current job is a step down from the one they lost, and a slim majority say they earn less than they did in their previous job. A quarter of those re-employed said they thought that the hit to their standard of living would be permanent.The reliance on one’s personal network and savings rather than the social safety net showed up frequently in the survey data.More people reported borrowing money from friends and family than reported using food stamps. A third cut back on doctors’ visits or medical treatment. A quarter of the unemployed said they had enrolled in retraining programs of some kind; half of them reported paying for the education on their own or through family assistance. Twenty-three percent received some type of government financing for their training programs.Unemployed workers were more likely than employed workers to say that the government is primarily responsible for helping the jobless. But even then, a majority of the unemployed thought that workers and employers were more responsible for getting people back to work than the government was.Americans over all were also somewhat less critical of bankers this time than they were two years earlier. About one in three (35 percent) respondents attributed high unemployment levels to the actions of Wall Street, compared with 45 percent in 2010.Americans were most likely to attribute high unemployment to cheap foreign labor. Four in 10 also said they believed illegal immigrants were taking Americans’ job opportunities — which does not bode well for political support for an amnesty program now being discussed in Washington.Most people surveyed lost at least some of their savings. Asked about their financial health, six in 10 Americans said their finances would not improve in the next few years; just 16 percent said their family finances were already back to prerecession levels or suffered no loss in the first place.More educated, better-off people were substantially more likely to report being as financially secure as they were before the recession began.Responses are based on an online survey conducted by GfK using a nationally representative sample of 1,090 adults.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/after-posting-lower-profit-glaxo-to-cut-costs.html,"LONDON (Reuters) — GlaxoSmithKline plans to cut costs in its struggling European drugs division and promised investors a return to growth this year, after failing to deliver a hoped-for recovery in sales and profits in 2012.The company, Britain’s biggest drug maker, said on Wednesday that a new program to restructure European operations, drug manufacturing and research would save at least about $1.6 billion annually by 2016.After putting a number of major drug patent losses behind it, Glaxo had originally banked on pulling out of its trough in 2012. In the event, sales were held back by larger-than-expected drug price cuts in austerity-hit Europe.The company reported that its net profit fell 35 percent, to £839 million (about $1.35 billion), from £1.28 billion in the fourth quarter a year earlier. Sales in the quarter fell 3 percent, to £6.80 billion. Excluding onetime items, Glaxo said it earned 32.6 pence a share, up 4 percent.Analysts had forecast sales of £6.88 billion and earnings of 31.3 pence a share, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters. Glaxo’s chief executive, Andrew P. Witty, hopes to do better this year. He predicted on Wednesday that earnings per share, after stripping out some items, would grow by 3 to 4 percent at constant exchange rates in 2013, with sales rising about 1 percent.Still, the forecast increase in sales and earnings this year was less than some analysts had hoped. A Deutsche Bank analyst, Mark Clark, also noted Glaxo gave a cautious outlook for profit margins, since these are expected to improve only “over the medium term.”Europe has been a weak point for many drug makers, but Glaxo’s portfolio has been particularly hard hit by government budget cuts. As a result, Mr. Witty said he was taking action to ”reduce costs, improve efficiencies and reallocate resources.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/us/politics/panetta-warns-of-dire-consequences-to-military-from-cuts.html,"WASHINGTON — In the wake of President Obama’s appeal to Congress to stave off across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts, Defense Secretary Leon E. Panetta warned Wednesday that reductions from the automatic cuts would curtail American naval operations in the western Pacific by as much as a third and force one-month furloughs for as many as 800,000 Defense Department civilian employees starting this spring.“This is not a game, this is reality,” Mr. Panetta said emphatically in a speech at Georgetown University, one of his last as defense secretary, in which he blasted Congress for what he said was its failure to live up to its responsibilities. “These steps would seriously damage the fragile American economy, and they would degrade our ability to respond to crisis precisely at a time of rising instability across the globe.”He added, “This is no way to govern the United States of America.”He said Congress had created “a self-made crisis” and called the automatic cuts, called sequestration, “legislative madness.” He described the cuts, which are scheduled to take effect on March 1, as “the most serious readiness crisis that this country is going to confront in over a decade.”Mr. Panetta has been warning in dire terms for months about the effects of the across-the-board cuts, but defense budget analysts have viewed a number of his admonitions as hyperbole meant to prod Congress into making a budget deal. On Wednesday, analysts said Mr. Panetta meant it this time.“These are real, legitimate impacts,” said Todd Harrison, an analyst at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a research group in Washington. Under sequestration, the Pentagon would have to cut nearly $50 billion, or about 9 percent, of current military spending by Oct. 1.The potential cutbacks in naval operations in the western Pacific are particularly striking since they would undermine what the Obama administration has promoted as a critical part of its defense strategy — a “pivot,” or rebalancing, of forces to the Asia-Pacific region to counter the increasing assertiveness of China’s military.Navy officials said Wednesday that they were considering cutbacks throughout the Seventh Fleet area of operations, which encompasses more than 48 million square miles and ranges from the Korean Peninsula to Guam to Australia and beyond. The officials said that the cuts would potentially reduce the number of ships, aircraft, joint military exercises and personnel in the region.The furloughs would potentially begin as early as April and would cut one work day a week from the Pentagon’s vast civilian work force for the next six months. The employees would face a corresponding 20 percent cut in pay, which Mr. Panetta said would have a substantial negative effect on the economy.Mr. Panetta said the across-the-board cuts would also force the Pentagon to reduce training and maintenance for the Army, including putting two-thirds of active-duty brigade combat teams outside of Afghanistan at “reduced readiness levels.” Army officials said Wednesday that this would mean less training at Army bases like Fort Irwin, Calif., and Fort Polk, La., for troops prepared to respond to crises around the world.The Pentagon’s current annual operating budget for the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30 is $534 billion, with an additional $88 billion largely for the cost of the war in Afghanistan. The across-the-board cuts would apply to the total of $622 billion, along with some additional funds that have not been spent in previous years.Mr. Panetta, a former chairman of the House Budget Committee and a former White House budget director under President Bill Clinton, has frequently expressed exasperation about the current climate on Capitol Hill.“My fear is that there is a dangerous and callous attitude that is developing among some Republicans and some Democrats that these dangerous cuts can be allowed to take place in order to blame the other party for the consequences,” he said.But Mr. Harrison of the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments said that some of the potential military cuts might be good ones. The Pentagon, he said, was heading toward delaying purchases of furniture and disallowing “nonessential travel” for conferences.“That’s probably stuff they could do without anyway,” he said. “If it’s nonessential travel, why were they doing it in the first place? There’s going to be a ban on boondoggles.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/nyregion/bloomberg-targets-homeowners-and-businesses-for-storm-aid-money.html,"New York City plans to spend its first $1 billion in federal money for Hurricane Sandy recovery on loans and grants to homeowners and businesses affected by the storm and efforts to protect public housing and critical infrastructure in the future, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Wednesday.The money will come from a $51 billion disaster relief package that will be distributed to New York, New Jersey and other affected areas. The first installment for the city will total $1.77 billion; in his presentation on Wednesday, Mr. Bloomberg did not say how he would use about $725 million of that initial payment.Under the plan, the city would spend $350 million on grants to low-, moderate- and middle-income owners of single-family homes — up to 1,000 homeowners whose primary residences were destroyed by the storm, and up to 8,300 whose primary residences were damaged but not destroyed.The city would spend $250 million on grants and low-interest loans to help repair up to 12,790 units of low-, moderate- and middle-income housing in multifamily homes and rental buildings damaged by the hurricane. It would spend $120 million to help fortify public housing against future storms, including putting permanent emergency generators in about 100 buildings.For businesses affected by the storm, the city would offer $100 million in grants to up to 1,300 businesses.Lastly, the city would spend $140 million on competitions to help utilities protect their networks against future storms, and to jump-start economic development in business districts heavily affected the storm.The plan, which the mayor announced in a news conference at City Hall, will require federal approval, but he said his administration had already had “extensive conversations” with the federal housing secretary, Shaun Donovan, and was hopeful the plans would be approved. In the afternoon, Mr. Bloomberg appeared with Mr. Donovan at a Staten Island pizzeria to thank the Obama administration for releasing the aid so quickly.Mr. Donovan also met with Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo in Manhattan to discuss the state’s proposals for spending its share of hurricane relief money.Mr. Bloomberg said it would take a few months to get federal approval for the programs and have them up and running, meaning the city would start taking applications for grants and loans in late April or early May.But he defended the timing, saying the city had already made roughly $10 million in emergency loans available to businesses, and restored some combination of power, heat and hot water to 9,800 buildings.By the standards of government, Mr. Bloomberg said, “this is instantaneous.”“The government doesn’t back up a truck and dump bills on the ground,” he continued.Asked about Mr. Cuomo’s proposal to offer to buy out homeowners in vulnerable coastal areas, Mr. Bloomberg said he appreciated the governor’s efforts, but he expressed doubt that many New Yorkers would accept the offer.“We’re focusing on trying to get people back into their houses right now,” he said, adding, “People are very proud of their homes in New York, particularly in these communities, and an awful lot of them just want to stay there.”Patrick Markee, a senior policy analyst at the Coalition for the Homeless, said that while Mr. Bloomberg’s proposals were “a start,” they offered little near-term help for what he estimated were 2,000 to 3,000 households, many of them very low income, still living in hotels.The best way to help them, Mr. Markee said, would be to distribute federal rental assistance vouchers, as was done after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. He said Congress had authorized Mr. Donovan to allocate recovery money for such aid, known as Section 8 vouchers.“We think that that’s frankly the most urgent need,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/global/japans-nikkei-average-surges.html,"TOKYO — Japan’s Nikkei average surged 3.8 percent Wednesday, closing at its highest point since October 2008, after the yen fell sharply amid expectations of a more aggressive economic policy.The benchmark rose 416.83 points to 11,463.75, its biggest one-day gain since March 2011, as the Japanese currency dropped to 94.08 against the dollar.On Tuesday, Masaaki Shirakawa, the governor of the Bank of Japan, said he would step down, along with his two deputies, in March, three weeks before the scheduled end of his five-year term.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has put the central bank under relentless pressure to do more to pull the economy out of the doldrums. Mr. Shirakawa’s announcement opened the way for him to quickly appoint a governor who would be bolder in loosening monetary policy.“There was a very aggressive, solid weakening of the yen in response to what seems like relatively trivial news,” said Stefan Worrall, director of equity sales at Credit Suisse in Tokyo. “But it’s nonetheless news that signals the expectation and recognition that the momentum in Japan is continuing to favor yen weakening,”Although investors have seen the weak yen as a boon for exporters over the last two and a half months, Mr. Worrall said, there are other benefits to a more competitive exchange rate.“On a U.S. dollar basis, Japan has yet to break out, particularly if you compare its rally with rallies” in Germany and Australia, he said.Indeed, brighter profit forecasts from the likes of Toyota Motor and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries helped sustain the optimistic mood Wednesday. Their gains stemmed from the weaker yen, which inflates the value of earnings from overseas.Toyota climbed 6.1 percent and was the most-traded stock by turnover on the main board, and Mitsubishi Heavy rose 10.4 percent, with both stocks hitting their highest levels since autumn 2008.Expectations of a new central bank governor also helped inflation-sensitive shares, as the central bank signed onto a new 2 percent inflation target last month with the government. On Wednesday, the real estate sector advanced 4 percent.Norihiro Fujito, senior investment strategist at Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley, said the central bank might start “open-ended” asset buying in April, well before the 2014 start the central bank committed to at its last policy meeting.Mr. Fujito said he saw Kazumasa Iwata, a former Bank of Japan deputy governor and a vocal supporter of an asset purchase fund of ¥50 trillion, or $530 billion, as the most likely candidate to succeed Mr. Shirakawa.Others seen as possible candidates are Haruhiko Kuroda, president of the Asian Development Bank, and Heizo Takenaka, who a decade ago was an economics minister."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/nyregion/de-blasio-donors-hit-maximum-but-keep-giving.html,"In an aggressive bid to increase contributions from major supporters, Bill de Blasio, the public advocate, has been taking donations to defray old campaign debts from people who have already given the maximum permissible amount to his current campaign for mayor.About two dozen individuals and unions that have given Mr. de Blasio’s 2013 campaign $4,950, the most allowed under New York City’s voluntary public financing system, have then turned around and given him more for his 2009 race, which has been in debt. In some instances, state records show, the donors, as well as their spouses, have given to the 2013 and 2009 campaigns on the same day.The tactic is legal, and many candidates ask donors to defray debts shortly after an election. But it not typical to see debt-defraying donations so closely coinciding with the moment when donors max out to a current campaign, according to city campaign finance officials and watchdog groups.“It stinks to high heaven,” said Meredith McGehee, policy director at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan organization in Washington, which analyzes campaign finance and ethics issues. “Clearly people are being solicited and are giving to these politicians in the hope that it will be noticed and they will get something — access and influence — in exchange for that donation.”The practice, which Ms. McGehee described as “double dipping” or a “double bonus,” is common in statewide and federal campaigns. But in New York City, which has one of the strictest campaign finance systems in the country, Mr. de Blasio’s fund-raising stands out because he has been such a vocal advocate of campaign finance reform, and because none of his three main rivals have done anything similar in scale.Aides to Mr. de Blasio vigorously defended the campaign’s practice as routine and noted that any money raised to settle the 2009 account cannot be used in for the current race. They also noted that his 2009 campaign must pay the city more than $300,000 after being fined by the city’s Environmental Control Board for illegally affixing posters. He has paid more than $100,000 to date.“Like many campaigns, we are forced to raise and spend money to deal with obligations arising out of our 2009 campaign, while also raising money for the current campaign,” said Dan Levitan, a campaign spokesman. “This is standard practice and adheres to New York City’s strict campaign finance laws.”Many of those now giving to Mr. de Blasio’s 2009 campaign for public advocate had not given at the time, but instead began giving to the 2009 campaign only after it became clear that Mr. de Blasio would run for mayor in 2013.For example, Alan Lapes, an operator of private homeless shelters, donated $4,950 on July 8, 2011, to Mr. de Blasio’s mayoral campaign. Mr. Lapes and his wife, Cindy, then donated $4,950 each on April 20, 2012, to Mr. de Blasio’s 2009 campaign, according to records from the State Board of Elections and the city’s Campaign Finance Board.Another first-time donor was Guy Roberts, who manages a taxi fleet in Chelsea. Mr. Roberts contributed $4,500 to the 2013 campaign on Jan. 9, 2012, then $5,000 to the 2009 campaign on Aug. 1, 2012.Over all, Mr. de Blasio has raised $369,000 to repay his 2009 debts, which includes the fine owed to the city among other expenses. The biggest chunk — $139,000 — was raised over the last six months. A few donors have given more than the maximum limit for the 2009 election cycle, the records show, but Mr. Levitan said the campaign “was in the process of issuing refunds.”John C. Liu, the comptroller, whose campaign fund-raising operation is under federal investigation, has raised $344,000 for his 2009 account since winning the 2009 election. But most of that money was raised in 2010. Only in a handful of instances did Mr. Liu’s 2013 contributors — none gave the maximum — later give to his 2009 account.Christine C. Quinn, the City Council speaker, reported five contributors who gave the maximum to her 2013 campaigns, before giving smaller amounts to her 2009 account. William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller, reported one such contributor."

European markets ended mostly lower.At a news conference, Mario Draghi, head of the European Central Bank, said the euro exchange rate was important to growth and price stability, remarks that investors took as a sign the bank was concerned with the single currency’s recent advance.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/nyregion/nafis-admits-trying-to-bomb-federal-reserve-bank-in-ny.html,"A Bangladeshi man who tried to blow up the Federal Reserve Bank of New York remotely only to find that the bomb was fake and his plot had been under the constant surveillance of federal agents pleaded guilty on Thursday to terrorism charges.The plea of the man, Quazi Mohammad Rezwanul Ahsan Nafis, 21, brought a quick resolution to a case that used one of the government’s most popular strategies for identifying and pursuing terrorism suspects: Undercover agents and a confidential source who learned that Mr. Nafis wanted to conduct an attack gave him the materials for a fake bomb and other support, leading him all the way to the moment of detonation before arresting him in October.In response to criticism of the law enforcement approach — and the claim that men like Mr. Nafis could not pull off an attack without the government’s help — Loretta E. Lynch, the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, emphasized that Mr. Nafis had entered the United States with plans to carry out the attack and that the sting operation was the best way to stop him.“He came with information about how to make bombs,” Ms. Lynch said in a news conference outside the Federal District Court in Brooklyn. “At every opportunity this defendant showed his determination and commitment to this plan.”Mr. Nafis pleaded guilty to attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction. He will be sentenced on May 30 and faces a sentence of 30 years to life in prison. The guilty plea came just four months after he parked a van with the fake bomb outside of the bank, in Lower Manhattan, hoping to destroy the immense building in a fiery explosion and strike a blow to the American economy.During the hearing, he flinched when Judge Carol B. Amon read the words “weapons of mass destruction.”“I had intended to commit a violent jihadist attack,” Mr. Nafis said, speaking slowly and softly. “I no longer support violent jihad. I deeply and sincerely regret my involvement in this case.”The case began last July, when Mr. Nafis, who entered the country five months earlier on a student visa, told a man he met on the Internet about his hopes to conduct a terrorist attack, according to the criminal complaint. That man was a confidential source working for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.The man introduced Mr. Nafis to a man he said was a member of Al Qaeda but who was actually a federal agent. In a series of meetings, Mr. Nafis and the undercover agent conceived and developed a terrorist plot that Mr. Nafis said would “destroy America,” according to the complaint.“I just want something big. Something very big. Very very very very big, that will shake the whole country,” he said in one of the conversations recorded by the New York Joint Terrorism Task Force, which includes F.B.I. agents and members of the Police Department.Mr. Nafis decided to target the financial district. He scouted the Federal Reserve building in August, taking pictures of it while federal agents were taking pictures of him.The original plan was for a suicide mission, but that changed when Mr. Nafis said he wanted to go home to Bangladesh first to put his affairs in order. The undercover agent responded that Mr. Nafis might then not be able to return to the United States and carry out his plan. Instead, the agent noted that Mr. Nafis could use a remote-control device to stage the attack and go back to Bangladesh afterward.On an October morning, the men built the fake 1,000-pound bomb in a local warehouse, using batteries, electrical items and large garbage bins that Mr. Nafis had bought, according to the criminal complaint. They assembled a detonator that was to be triggered by a cellphone, and drove in a van to the Federal Reserve Bank. Mr. Nafis was arrested in a nearby hotel after he tried to explode the bomb."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/technology/ben-verwaayen-alcatel-lucent-chief-resigns.html,"BERLIN — Alcatel-Lucent said Thursday that its chief executive, Ben Verwaayen, would step down as the company, a maker of telecommunications equipment, posted a big loss for the fourth quarter.Mr. Verwaayen, 60, was hired in September 2008 and promised to transform Alcatel-Lucent into a “normal” company that would pay a dividend by 2012. But he never managed to restore reliable profitability. The company has not paid a dividend since 2007.Éric Beaudet, an analyst at Natixis, a bank in Paris, said that Mr. Verwaayen had lost credibility among investors after promising a succession of restructuring plans that had failed to turn the company around.“With the C.E.O. having lost credibility, we believe that this move will be appreciated, even though a replacement has not yet been named,” Mr. Beaudet wrote in a note to investors.On Thursday, Alcatel-Lucent — created by the 2006 merger of Alcatel of France and Lucent Technologies of New Jersey — reported a loss of €1.37 billion, or $1.8 billion, for the last three months of 2012, compared with a profit of €868 million a year earlier. Sales fell 1.3 percent in the period, to €4.1 billion.In 2010, Alcatel-Lucent posted a net loss of €292 million. The next year, the company had a €1.1 billion net profit. For 2012, the company reported a loss of €1.1 billion.Shares of Alcatel-Lucent fell 4.9 percent in Paris trading to close at €1.23.  Since Mr. Verwaayen’s appointment, the shares have lost more than half of their value.Philippe Camus, the chairman of the Alcatel-Lucent board, announced the departure, saying that Mr. Verwaayen had decided not to seek re-election as chief executive at the company’s annual meeting this spring. Mr. Verwaayen will stay on until a successor is found, Mr. Camus said, adding that the board was reviewing internal and external candidates.In a statement, Mr. Verwaayen said the company needed new leadership.“Alcatel-Lucent has been an enormous part of my life,” Mr. Verwaayen said. “It was therefore a difficult decision to not seek a further term. But it was clear to me that now is an appropriate moment for the board to seek fresh leadership to take the company forward.”Under his tenure, Alcatel-Lucent developed a unified set of network products, eliminating redundant French and American gear, and focused efforts around wireless broadband technologies as it fought larger rivals like Ericsson of Sweden and Huawei of China.In an interview a few months after becoming chief executive, Mr. Verwaayen displayed a feisty, fighting spirit, rejecting the then-prevailing negative sentiment surrounding Alcatel-Lucent, which one analyst had likened to an “Amtrak-TGV train crash.”Mr. Verwaayen dryly replied that he was “very grateful for their concerns and their love and care for us, which is really very heartwarming.” He went on to say that he was “confident that you will find a company that is alive and kicking, a company that is a force.”Alcatel-Lucent initially relied on sales to AT&T — a legacy of Lucent’s origins as Bell Labs, the AT&T research arm — and other U.S. telecommunications companies, as well as to French public entities like Thales, a government defense, aerospace and transport contractor. But it was unable to expand quickly enough beyond its base to keep pace with Ericsson and Huawei, which now dwarf Alcatel-Lucent in sales and profit.“Mr. Verwaayen had done as much as he could with the assets he had,” said Martin Nilsson, an analyst at Handelsbanken in Stockholm. “But when he came in, things were pretty bad there, and a lot of ground had been lost.”Lucent, Mr. Nilsson said, had been reduced to making “legacy” fixed-line products for AT&T and other American operators, a once-lucrative business whose profitability had diminished following deregulation of the U.S. telecommunications industry in the 1980s.Alcatel had a similar symbiotic relationship with the French government, supplying most of the core equipment and landlines to France Télécom, or to public entities like Thales.But Mr. Verwaayen’s austerity cure, which he successfully applied as chief executive of the former British telecom monopoly BT from 2001 to 2008, has not brought the same results at Alcatel-Lucent.Mr. Camus credited Mr. Verwaayen for leading the company out of a difficult transition following its merger.“Over the last few years, Ben has set a new direction, created one company out of two, and has recently seen through the completion of the stabilization of the company’s balance sheet, enabling us to move forward with confidence,” Mr. Camus said.When Mr. Verwaayen took over in 2008, Alcatel-Lucent had already cut 16,500 jobs and posted a combined €16 billion in losses since the 2006 merger.Since then Alcatel-Lucent has seemed to lurch from one restructuring to the next, even as it increasingly lost ground among its key European customers. In July, with its finances looking increasingly tenuous, Alcatel-Lucent announced plans to cut another 5,500 jobs; most observers believe they will not be the last cuts.The reshufflings failed to significantly reduce the company’s size. Alcatel-Lucent currently employs about 76,000 workers. At the end of 2008, the company said it had 77,177.Mr. Nilsson, the Handelsbanken analyst, said Alcatel-Lucent could end up being sold for its remaining assets, which include a strong position in the business for undersea communications cables, as well as what he described as “very solid” relationships with U.S operators, including AT&T and Verizon.“Five to 10 years from now, I would not be surprised if the company was no longer called Alcatel-Lucent,” Mr. Nilsson said. “But there are some strong assets, and I am sure those businesses will survive in some form.”Odon de Laporte, a telecom analyst with CA Cheuvreux in London, said Mr. Verwaayen had bought time for his successor to deliver on the existing strategy or come up with a new one.He said investors were hoping that the next chief executive would be a high-profile person with knowledge of the international telecom industry. “The worst case, in my view, would be to appoint a French technocrat, operating under political pressure,” he said.The new chief would need to move quickly to streamline the company, probably selling off the submarine cable and enterprise businesses, and — above all — to implement rapidly whatever restructuring plan is needed.“They need to execute this,” Mr. de Laporte said. “They’ve always been two years behind the curve in cost cutting and restructuring. It’s a fast-moving business and you need to move quickly.”Mr. de Laporte added that the cultural challenges that confronted the combined company early on were no longer so large a factor.“It’s not about American-French integration anymore,” he said. “That’s behind us. It’s about the market and strategy. If you have good products and a good strategy, French and Americans can work together.”David Jolly contributed reporting from Paris."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/economy/drop-in-jobless-claims-hints-at-slow-recovery-in-labor-market.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) — The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits fell last week and the trend line for jobless claims reached nearly a five-year low, providing signs that the slow recovery in the labor market remains on track.Other reports on Thursday showed many top retailers had strong sales in January even as customers were hit with higher taxes, while productivity at businesses slumped in the fourth quarter.Initial claims for state unemployment benefits dropped by 5,000 to a seasonally adjusted 366,000, the Labor Department said. That was enough to pull down a four-week moving average of new claims, a gauge of the trend in layoffs, by 2,250 to 350,500, its lowest since March 2008.“The labor market is improving, but certainly not at a robust rate by any means,” said Russell Price, an economist at Ameriprise Financial.While employers have pulled back on layoffs, they have added jobs only at a lackluster pace. Economists say the tepid recovery of the labor market means the Federal Reserve is likely to keep buying bonds into next year to keep borrowing costs low.In a sign of the difficulty many people have in finding a job, the number of people still receiving benefits under regular state programs after an initial week of aid increased 8,000, to 3.22 million, in the week ended Jan. 26.The economy has shown signs of underlying strength despite a surprise contraction in the fourth quarter.Consumer spending has been looking stronger, and many retailers reported robust sales. Over all, sales at stores open more than a year rose 5 percent in January for 20 retailers, according to Thomson Reuters, pointing to some resilience in spending despite the increase in payroll taxes that hit most Americans last month.The Commerce Department’s more comprehensive report on January retail sales, due on Feb. 13, is expected to show that sales edged higher from December when adjusted for seasonal swings.Consumers are borrowing rather readily, a sign of confidence in the recovery. Consumer credit increased by $14.59 billion in December, the Federal Reserve said in a report.The gains were driven by the biggest increase in nonrevolving credit, which includes student and auto loans, since November 2001.Separately, the Labor Department said worker productivity outside the farming sector fell in the fourth quarter by the most in nearly two years as output increased only marginally despite steady gains in employment.Productivity declined at a 2 percent annual rate, the sharpest drop since the first quarter of 2011 and a larger fall than the 1.3 percent forecast by economists in a Reuters poll.Productivity is expected to rebound in the current period because analysts believe weak output during the fourth quarter was partly a result of temporary factors, like an unusually sharp decline in government spending on the military.The drop in productivity combined with a big increase in hourly compensation to drive unit labor costs up at a sharp 4.5 percent rate in the fourth quarter.Hourly compensation, which includes wages as well as employer contributions to social insurance and private benefit plans like health care, rose at a 2.4 percent rate."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/asset-sales-help-quarterly-profit-at-times-company.html,"The New York Times Company reported a big jump in fourth-quarter profit on Thursday, largely because of gains from asset sales.Net income was $176.9 million, or $1.14 a share, a 200 percent increase from $58.9 million, or 39 cents a share, in the period a year earlier.The results were aided by a $164.6 million gain on the sale of the company’s stake in Indeed.com, a jobs search engine, and the sale of the About Group, the online resource company, for $300 million. The sale of the About Group resulted in a total gain of $96.7 million, or $61.9 million after taxes.Income from continuing operations rose to $117 million, compared with $51 million in the period a year earlier.Total revenue for the quarter rose 5.2 percent, to $575.8 million. Over all, the company’s advertising revenue declined 3.1 percent. Print advertising at the company’s newspapers, which include The New York Times, The Boston Globe and The International Herald Tribune, shrank 5.6 percent, and digital advertising revenue across the company rose 5.1 percent. Circulation revenue grew 16.1 percent.For the entire year, the Times Company reported net income of $133 million, or 87 cents a share, compared with a loss of $39.7 million, or 26 cents a share, in the previous year.Income from continuing operations rose to $159.8 million in 2012 from $51.3 million in 2011, or $1.04 a share, up from 34 cents in 2011. Total revenue rose 1.9 percent, to $1.99 billion.The last year was the first time that circulation revenue surpassed advertising revenue. Circulation revenue grew by 10.4 percent, to $952.9 million, mainly from the growth in digital subscriptions and the rise in print circulation prices. Advertising for the year declined 5.9 percent, to $898.1 million.The number of paid subscribers to the Web site, e-reader and other digital editions of The Times and The International Herald Tribune reached about 640,000 at the end of the fourth quarter, a 13 percent increase from the third quarter of 2012. Digital subscriptions to The Boston Globe and BostonGlobe.com also grew, by 8 percent, to about 28,000 subscribers.“The demonstrated willingness of users here and around the world to pay for the high-quality journalism for which The New York Times and the company’s other titles are renowned will be a key building block in the strategy for growth, which we are currently developing and which I will have much more to say about later in the year,” said Mark Thompson, the president and chief executive of the Times Company.Some analysts pointed to the growth of digital circulation as a hopeful sign for the company. Alexia S. Quadrani, an analyst at JPMorgan Chase, said she was impressed by how much digital subscriptions continued to rise nearly two years after the company introduced its paywall.“The New York Times is in a stronger position because the circulation revenue is the majority of revenue, where for typical newspapers it’s probably 25 or 30 percent,” Ms. Quadrani said.The company expects advertising revenue to remain sluggish in the first quarter of 2013 and total circulation revenue to grow by “mid-single digits.” The company said in its release that it “expects to benefit from its digital subscription initiatives as well as from the print circulation price increase at The New York Times implemented in the first quarter of 2013.”Some investors expressed disappointment that Mr. Thompson, who oversaw his first earnings call as the company’s chief executive, said he did not have immediate plans to restore a dividend even though the company has $955 million in cash and short-term investments.Douglas Arthur, an equity analyst at Evercore Partners, an investment bank that follows The Times and that has a buy on the stock, noted that before Times Company management started speaking in their 11 a.m. conference call, the stock had risen to $9.48 from $8.24. After Mr. Thompson announced on the call that it was not “the appropriate time to restore a dividend,” Mr. Arthur noted that the stock price dropped. It closed at $8.51, up 3.28 percent from the previous day.“There’s significant disappointment that there’s no thoughts of a dividend,” he said. “As soon as the statement was made, the stock sold off.”The results followed several difficult quarters during which the company tried to streamline operations and expand its digital and video presence. In early December, The Times said the newsroom needed to contribute to the company’s cost-cutting efforts and announced it was seeking 30 managers to accept buyout packages. The company also allowed employees represented by the Newspaper Guild to volunteer for buyout packages.In a memo that Jill Abramson, the executive editor, wrote to the staff last week, she said that she had received enough volunteers that layoffs were kept to a handful. She also announced plans to restructure the masthead. On Wednesday, the paper also announced that it had hired Rebecca Howard from the AOL Huffington Post Media Group to become the new general manager of the video production unit."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/fed-official-sees-tension-in-some-credit-markets.html,"Some financial markets are showing signs of overheated speculation as investors take larger risks in response to the persistence of low interest rates, a senior Federal Reserve official said in a speech on Thursday.The official, Jeremy C. Stein, a Fed governor, highlighted a surge in junk bond issues, the popularity of certain kinds of real estate investment trusts and shifts in bank balance sheets as areas the Fed is watching closely, although he played down any immediate threat to the financial system or the broader economy.“We are seeing a fairly significant pattern of reaching-for-yield behavior emerging in corporate credit,” Mr. Stein said in St. Louis. He added, however, “It need not follow that this risk-taking has ominous systemic implications.”Mr. Stein gave no indication that Fed officials were contemplating any change in their aggressive efforts to hold down interest rates. Rather, he described the signs of overheating as an emerging trend that might require a response if it intensified over the next 18 months.But the speech nonetheless underscored that the Fed regards investment bubbles, rather than inflation, as the most likely negative consequence of its push to reduce unemployment by stimulating economic growth.Mr. Stein also challenged the general view among central bankers that excessive speculation was best addressed through targeted regulation like loan underwriting standards, and not broad changes in monetary policy. He urged an “open mind” about the use of higher interest rates and changes in the Fed’s investment portfolio to curtail such speculation.Such a shift could alter the mechanics of the Fed’s eventual retreat from its long-running stimulus campaign, now aimed at maintaining control over inflation.“By no means does today’s speech signify a change in the Fed orthodoxy regarding the use of interest rates to address financial imbalances,” wrote Michael Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase, after the speech. “But Stein is an emerging thought leader on the board, and his critique is likely to stimulate further debate.”The Fed has held short-term interest rates near zero since late 2008, and amassed almost $3 trillion of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities. The caution of chastened investors is one factor restraining the economic recovery. By lowering the cost of borrowing and limiting the availability of safe investments, the central bank is both pushing and pulling investors to take larger risks.But low rates can help to drive asset prices to unsustainable levels, as in the dot-com bubble that popped in 2000 and, of course, the recent housing bubble.Critics of the Fed’s policies have pointed to the junk bond market as an area where low interest rates are encouraging excessive speculation. Investors are eagerly providing money to companies and countries with low credit ratings, and they are accepting historically low junk bond interest rates in return. Junk bond issuance in the United States set a new annual record last year — by the end of October.“We must not ignore the possibility that the low-interest rate policy may be creating incentives that lead to future financial imbalances,” Esther L. George, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, warned in a speech last month. Ms. George cited this same concern about financial destabilization in casting the sole dissenting vote at the most recent meeting of the Fed’s policy-making committee.The Fed has invested much time and effort in improving its ability to assess market conditions. Mr. Stein said Thursday, drawing on that work, that it did see evidence of overheating in the junk bond market. Relative prices remain around historical norms, but junk bonds make up a rising share of total corporate issuance, historically an indicator that investors are taking outsize risks.And Mr. Stein said he took the junk bond data, along with similar patterns in other kinds of investments, as potential evidence of a broader trend.“Overheating in the junk bond market might not be a major systemic concern in and of itself, but it might indicate that similar overheating forces were at play in other parts of credit markets, out of our range of vision,” he said.Changes in regulation offer a relatively precise way to address such problems. If mortgage lending standards loosen, the Fed can tighten those standards rather than raising interest rates and reducing other kinds of lending too.But Mr. Stein said that regulators could fix only the problems they could find. Monetary policy “gets in all of the cracks,” he said. “Changes in rates may reach into corners of the market that supervision and regulation cannot.”He also suggested that the Fed could reduce the profitability of certain kinds of investments by adjusting its holdings of Treasuries and mortgage bonds.While emphasizing that he was not seeking imminent changes in policy, Mr. Stein closed on a cautionary note: “Waiting for decisive proof of market overheating,” he said, “may amount to an implicit policy of inaction.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/sp-may-have-tempted-arthur-andersens-fate.html,"They were the gatekeepers, with a clear conflict of interest — the people they were supposed to check up on were also the ones who hired and paid them. The need to protect their reputation was supposed to assure that the conflict would not lead to bad behavior.But it did not. Those within the firm who wanted to be tough found themselves outmaneuvered by those who wanted to make compromises to keep business that might otherwise be lost to competitors — competitors who were not above making compromises themselves. It was not that they wanted to act badly, only that they did not want to offend important customers. They had no idea that the corners they were cutting would blow up into a scandal that would dominate the news, shock the nation and lead to the demise of the firm.That is a description of what happened to Arthur Andersen, the accounting firm, more than a decade ago.It may turn out to be a description of what will happen to Standard & Poor’s, the ratings agency, as a result of its behavior during the housing boom.The good news for S.& P. is that it faces only civil liability from the suit filed this week by the Justice Department. It was the criminal complaint against Andersen that sealed the firm’s fate.But the allegations in the suit are reminiscent of what happened at Andersen, whose image had previously been of being the most independent, and most committed to quality accounting, of the major firms.Until now, the role of the credit ratings agencies in the financial crisis had seemed — to me, at least — to be defensible. They may have been foolish or even stupid, but they were not venal. They applied their models in good faith in rating mortgage-backed securities. Their models proved to be overly optimistic, but the housing collapse was an unprecedented event. Being wrong is not a crime.The Justice Department suit offers a different sequence of events. As the housing bubble grew, and the revenue from rating the deals skyrocketed, S.& P. was determined to stay competitive with other agencies — Moody’s and Fitch — in getting the business. That led to tinkering with models and ignoring inconvenient evidence so as to produce the ratings that were desired by the banks putting together the deals. Even when it became clear that new deals did not deserve the ratings they were getting, S.& P. chose to issue high ratings.By not filing criminal charges, the government got a lower burden of proof — preponderance of the evidence rather than beyond a reasonable doubt — while the potential for a $5 billion fine provides punishment as severe as any criminal case against a corporation could.It is important to understand the financial alchemy that was involved in rating mortgage securitizations.In the corporate world, to get a top rating a company has to have a sterling balance sheet and good prospects. But not in the world of securitizations. The logic was that a lot of clearly risky subprime mortgages could be put together and — presto, become mostly AAA in a residential mortgage-backed security, or R.M.B.S. Since it was extremely unlikely that more than, say, 20 percent of the mortgages would default, 80 percent of the money that financed them could be raised by issuing AAA-rated securities.And the agencies took that one step further. Put together junior securities from a bunch of such deals and issue a new securitization, called a collateralized debt obligation, or C.D.O., and most of it was AAA too.The result was that the boom in subprime lending was financed by investors who were told they had supersafe securities. The bubble would not have happened without S.& P. and its peers.The Justice Department has evidently been through every memo, e-mail and text message sent out by S.& P. analysts and executives from 2004 through 2007, and found some that sound as if bosses were putting the short-term commercial interests of S.& P. — both the fees it got and the need to maintain good will with the investment bankers who chose which rating firm to use — ahead of truth.The most recent events the government complains about happened in 2007, and there are five-year statutes of limitations in some fraud laws. So the government turned to a 1989 law that makes it illegal to defraud a bank — a law passed during the savings and loan scandals — that has a 10-year statute of limitation, and cites case after case where banks bought the securities S.& P. rated, and lost money. Some of those cases sound real, but as Jonathan Weil of Bloomberg News has pointed out, in some cases the bank that S.& P. is supposed to have defrauded is the very same bank that put together the securitization, and kept part of it. It seems like a stretch.By the government account, the crucial event that sent S.& P. down the road to crime and shame came in 2004, when the housing boom was a pale shadow of what it would become. “We just lost a huge Mizuho R.M.B.S. deal to Moody’s due to a huge difference in the required credit support level,” an analyst wrote in a e-mail. “What we found from the arranger was that our support level was at least 10 percent higher than Moody’s.”That, the government said, spurred S.& P. to find ways to assure that it would not lose deals in the future. If that meant compromising its integrity, that was acceptable to the people running the agency.I wondered what happened to that deal, which was sponsored by Mizuho Financial, a Japanese bank. It turns out that the deal, issued in Japan and backed by Japanese mortgages, worked out very well. All the investors were repaid.That same Japanese bank, as it happens, provides some evidence to support an S.& P. defense argument — that it moved faster than its competitors in 2007 to downgrade bad securities.The government complaint says that in the spring of 2007, as the C.D.O. market was starting to collapse, S.& P. worked with banks to let them issue C.D.O.’s with ratings that the agency knew were not deserved. But by July of that year, according to the Securities and Exchange Commission, S.& P. had announced new rating procedures that would have kept Mizuho from getting the desired ratings on a C.D.O. it was about to issue. Mizuho, the S.E.C.  charged last year,  lied to S.& P. about what was in the C.D.O., and got the desired AAA rating. Within six months, the C.D.O. was in default.The fact that S.& P. was fooled may not speak well for its procedures and competence, but it does seem to indicate that in 2007 at least one of the banks pushing bad C.D.O.’s out the door thought S.& P. could not be relied upon to help it deceive investors.The traditional ratings agency defense of free speech — this was our opinion and even if it turned out to be wrong we are not liable — will be in trouble if the government’s case that S.& P. knew it was handing out undeserved ratings stands up. That defense has already failed in a case in Australia concerning a complicated security, in which a judge found no “reasonably competent ratings agency” would have given it the rating S.& P. did. IMF, an Australian firm that finances litigation in return for a share of the proceeds if the litigation succeeds, has announced it will finance a similar action in the Netherlands.I presume David Duncan, the Andersen partner who was in charge of the Enron audit, had no inkling the company was in danger of collapse when he sanctioned some questionable accounting over the objection of experts in Andersen’s national office.If S.& P. analysts and executives acted as the government says they did, they presumably thought there were large enough margins of safety in their assumptions that cutting a few corners would not hurt.Floyd Abrams, a partner in Cahill Gordon & Reindel who is representing S.& P., points out that the government case quotes from no secret whistle-blower, indicating that while the government has interviewed a lot of people from S.& P., including many who have left, it found none who would support the claim that the ratings were knowingly wrong. He notes that in 2007 those who thought the housing mess would not lead to disaster included the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department, as well as S.& P.S.& P., like Andersen, issued opinions that turned out to be disastrously wrong. The firm needs to prove those were honestly held opinions, not ones motivated by greed. If the government can prove otherwise, S.& P.’s future may be bleak."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/business/global/bank-of-england-leaves-interest-rate-unchanged.html,"LONDON — The Bank of England kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged on Thursday amid concerns that the British economy could fall back into a recession for the third time in five years.The central bank decided to leave its interest rate at 0.5 percent, a record low, and also held its program of economic stimulus at £375 billion, or about $500 billion.The pound has been falling against the euro and the dollar this year amid concerns among investors that the British economy would not manage to recover anytime soon. Uncertainty about the economic situation in the euro zone, Britain’s biggest export market, and ongoing budget cuts and tax increases at home mean that British households and companies continue to hold back on spending.Philip Shaw, an economist at Investec, said recent economic data had been disappointing but the British economy was probably still growing “albeit slowly.” The most urgent issue facing Britain’s economy remains the availability of credit, especially for small- and medium-sized businesses, which make up almost half of private sector revenue, he said.The central bank also, exceptionally, issued inflation guidance Thursday as part of its interest rate announcement.Inflation is likely to rise from 2.7 percent at the moment and may remain above the 2 percent target for the next two years, the bank said. It cited weak productivity, higher university fees and a rise in energy bills as prime causes of higher consumer prices.Some economists expect Mark Carney, the Bank of Canada governor who is to take over as governor of the Bank of England in July, to take more radical steps than the current governor, Mervyn A. King, to fuel economic growth.The Bank of England has come under pressure recently from parts of the government to do more to ease lending to companies. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development on Wednesday said the Bank of England should buy more bonds if the economy continues to be weak.Concerns that Britain’s economy could fall back into a recession increased after the economy shrank 0.3 percent during the last three months of 2012. House prices fell in January and the outlook for the market is unclear, Halifax, a mortgage lender, said this month. The construction sector shrank for a third month in January, partly because of heavy snowfall and bad weather.The National Institute of Economic and Social Research lowered its forecast on Tuesday, saying it expects the economy to grow 0.7 percent in 2013, not the 1.1 percent it predicted earlier. It also said that such low rates of growth might continue for some time and the government should consider relaxing its austerity program.But Nick Clegg, the deputy prime minister, told the BBC in an interview last month that the government would stick to its budget deficit reduction plan no matter what. He also said that parts of the economy would take a while to fix.A speech last month by Prime Minister David Cameron proposing a referendum on Britain’s European Union membership after the next general election could further slow the economic recovery by creating uncertainty among investors, Mr. Clegg said.But there were also some signs recently that a recovery is under way. After dismal business during the holiday season in December, retail sales rose in January and the services sector surprised some economists by growing at the fastest pace in four months in January. The manufacturing industry also grew last month.In a grilling by members of Parliament on Thursday in London, Mr. Carney said that the Bank of England should consider giving clearer guidance on the level of interest rates in the future and – if necessary – let inflation return to its 2 percent target more slowly.Mr. Carney said there was some “merit in considering a Federal Reserve-style threshold guidance.”Some flexibility with achieving the central bank’s inflation target of 2 percent is necessary, Mr. Carney said, especially because of the strong headwinds the British economy is facing at the moment.“Flexible inflation targeting has been in my view the most successful framework,” he said.Lark Turner contributed reporting from London."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/opinion/a-new-front-in-global-trade-wars.html,"A 10-year trade dispute between the United States and the Caribbean nation of Antigua and Barbuda involving online gambling has reached an important turning point that could set a disturbing precedent for global commerce. Last week, the World Trade Organization authorized Antigua and Barbuda to violate intellectual property protections on American movies, books, pharmaceuticals and other goods as compensation for United States policies that harmed the islands’ online gambling business.The judgment, if carried out, could open up a whole new front in trade wars, in which countries retaliate against unfair practices by imposing tariffs or quotas on other goods. But while it’s relatively easy to dole out tit-for-tat punishment when it comes to goods like bananas, which are easy to measure, it will be much harder to do that with intellectual property, because copies of, say, Hollywood movies, can be further copied.Antigua made a strong case to the W.T.O. that American policies like restrictions on money transfers have undercut its online gambling sites in violation of trade agreements in which the United States committed not to restrict such businesses. As a result, it says it has lost most of the 4,000 jobs connected to online gambling it once had.It is unclear how, or if, Antigua will take advantage of the judgment, which limits the amount of harm it can cause to the owners of copyrights and patents in the United States to $21 million a year. Some have speculated that it could pirate American movies or music by offering them for sale online at cut-rate prices, or it could offer generic versions of patented drugs.Antiguan officials say they would prefer a monetary settlement from Washington. United States officials have offered help in increasing American tourists to the islands, which officials there have said is too paltry a remedy. Both sides need to return to the negotiating table and come up with a deal that does not rely on legally approved piracy."

The index is at its highest point since November 2007 and has advanced for six weeks, the longest streak of gains since August.The Dow Jones industrial average rose 48.92 points, or 0.35 percent, to 13,992.97.The Dow had its best January in almost two decades and closed above 14,000 on Feb. 1 for the first time since 2007. The index is up 6.78 percent so far this year; the S.& P. 500 is up 6.43 percent.The Nasdaq composite index climbed 28.74 points, or 0.91 percent, to 3,193.87.A last-minute budget deal in Washington to avoid tax increases and spending cuts has helped to power the rally, on top of optimism about housing and gradual improvements in the jobs market.The S.& P. 500 finished the week higher despite logging its biggest daily decline in almost three months on Monday after worrying news from Europe. The index fell 1.2 percent that day as bond yields in Spain and Italy rose on concern that the region’s politicians would drag Europe back into crisis. The European Central Bank president, Mario Draghi, made cautious comments about the region’s economy on Thursday, which also weighed on markets.“Everybody seems to be saying this market needs to correct,” said Robert Pavlik, chief market strategist at Banyan Partners. “Nobody wants to be in it, but nobody wants to be out of it.”Largely positive corporate earnings reports and a report that showed that the United States trade deficit narrowed sharply in December provided more fuel for the market’s advance on Friday.The trade deficit fell nearly 21 percent in December from November, to $38.5 billion, the smallest point in nearly three years, as exports rose while oil imports plummeted. The smaller trade gap means the economy most likely performed better in the final three months of last year than first reported last week.“The trade balance was surprisingly very good,” said Philip J. Orlando, chief market strategist at Federated Investors.The government estimated that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the last three months of 2012. Mr. Orlando said that may now be revised to growth of 0.5 percent.Shares of LinkedIn, the online professional networking service, jumped $26.39, or 21.27 percent, to $150.48, after the company reported fourth-quarter results late on Thursday that beat analysts’ forecasts.AOL shares soared $2.31, or 7.35 percent, to $33.72, after the company said its quarterly revenue grew for the first time in eight years, helped by strength in worldwide advertising.Analysts are expecting earnings for the fourth quarter of 2012 to rise 6.5 percent for S.& P. 500 companies, according to data from S&P Capital IQ. That is an increase from the 2.4 percent growth rate recorded for the preceding quarter.Stocks have benefited as investors poured a net $4.1 billion into stock mutual funds since the start of the year, according to data provided by Lipper.“I’m very encouraged by the fact that, finally, for the first time in many years, individual investors seem to be participating in this,” said David Kelly, chief global strategist at J. P. Morgan Funds.The Treasury’s benchmark 10-year note rose 2/32, to 97 4/32, and the yield fell to 1.95 percent from 1.96 percent late on Thursday.Trading volume was light as Wall Street braced for a large winter storm.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/economy/recovery-has-brought-more-jobs-for-men-than-women.html,"SINCE the job market in the United States hit bottom more than three years ago, men have benefited from the recovery far more than woman have, with middle-aged women doing particularly poorly.From December 2009 through last month, the economy added 5.3 million jobs, according to the Labor Department’s monthly survey of households. Only 30 percent of them went to women. To some extent, that is simply a reflection of the fact that the recession hit men much harder than women, but the result has been at least a temporary reversal of the long trend of women holding an ever-increasing share of jobs.The proportion of jobs held by women, which was around 28 percent when the household survey began in 1948, rose to a peak of 47.5 percent in January 2010, just after the economy hit bottom. During that period, there was only one substantial setback to the trend, in 1952 and 1953, when the end of the Korean War brought soldiers back to the civilian economy.But in the first months of this recovery, that number fell as low as 46.6 percent, and it was at just 46.8 percent in January.The household survey is separate from the establishment survey, which asks employers how many people are on their payrolls. That survey hit bottom in February 2010, and showed 5.5 million jobs had been added. But it does not collect information on gender, as the household survey does.The accompanying charts show the changing employment patterns since the end of 2009 for men and women in various age groups, from 20 to 24 years to over 55. Because demographic shifts have been abrupt for some groups, like the baby boomers — there are a lot more people over 55 now, and fewer people aged 35 to 54 — the charts look at changes in the employment-to-population ratio.That ratio differs from the more widely noted unemployment rate in that it compares the number of people who have jobs with the total population, not just with the total number of people who say they were working or looking for jobs during the month.In January, 54.6 percent of women over the age of 20 had jobs. That was the lowest proportion since 1993, and 0.8 percentage point lower than the figure in December 2009. By contrast, 67.6 percent of men over 20 had jobs, a rate that is 1.3 percentage points higher than it was at the end of 2009, although still below prerecession levels.The sharpest declines in employment for women were in the 20-to-24 and 45-to-54 age groups. The decline in the younger group may reflect the difficulties young people face in trying to start a career, but the decline in the middle-aged group is not so easily explained.Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, said it might be a result of who has, and has not, been hiring. He pointed to the Institute for Supply Management’s survey of manufacturers, which has indicated that companies are hiring, and to the survey by the National Federation of Independent Business, which indicates that its members are not. “Women are more likely to be employed by small service-sector companies than by large manufacturers,” he said.The largest increase in the proportion of women with jobs has come among those over 55, which is also the group that is growing the fastest. It seems likely that more men and women are delaying retirement. The proportion of women aged 55 to 59 with jobs does not appear to be increasing, but the proportion of women aged 60 to 64 with jobs has been rising."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/global/peugeot-citroen-takes-5-2-billion-writedown.html,"PARIS — Another French industry is in trouble. And once again the Socialist government of President François Hollande is sending mixed messages — and renewing concerns elsewhere in Europe that France may be returning to old ways where industrial policy is concerned.On Friday, after more signs of financial stress at PSA Peugeot Citroën, Budget Minister Jérôme Cahuzac said the government was considering its options, including taking a stake in the carmaker through France’s strategic investment fund.“Let’s be clear, the company cannot and must not disappear,” he told RMC radio and BFM television. “We have to do whatever is necessary to support it.”But Mr. Cahuzac was later contradicted by officials who outrank him, including Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault, who said that Peugeot was not seeking aid, and Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici, who said that intervention along those lines “is not on the agenda.”Those hasty correctives may or may not assuage concerns elsewhere, but the issue is sensitive among Europe’s industrial leaders. Any attempt to prop up Peugeot could strain France’s relations with Germany, whose carmakers have not been hit nearly as hard by the downturn in the region’s economy and auto market. And any helping hand from the Élysée Palace could provoke workers in Italy to call for similar actions to help Fiat, the country’s largest employer, which is also under severe pressure.The officials made their comments after Peugeot, the biggest automaker in Europe after Volkswagen, said late Thursday that it would mark down the value of its car plants and other automotive assets by more than one-fourth — by about €3.9 billion, or $5.2 billion — to reflect “the impact on the group of the deterioration of the European market.”That charge, and an additional €243 million write-down for what the company called “onerous” contracts — which include a supply deal with Iran — will make a big dent in the bottom line when Peugeot reports its 2012 results Wednesday. But the company and government officials were at pains to note that the noncash charges would not affect its solvency.Pierre-Olivier Salmon, a PSA Peugeot Citroën spokesman, declined to comment Friday.Some of the problems facing Peugeot are shared by its competitors. The European Union’s car market shrank 8 percent last year, to just over 12 million units, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers’ Association, reducing demand for new cars to the lowest level since 1995.But Peugeot did worse than the Union’s overall market, with deliveries falling 13 percent, hurt by its reliance on South European markets where the euro crisis and austerity hurt demand. Its profitability has suffered from its concentration on lower-price models with thinner profit margins, compared with Germany’s automakers.As its woes have mounted, its market value has slipped to about €2.1 billion, compared with about €80 billion for Volkswagen.German automakers like Audi and Mercedes-Benz, as well as Volkswagen, have been able to compensate for weakness in Europe by selling cars in the United States, where Peugeot is not present. What is more, the German domestic market has remained relatively stable, falling only 3 percent last year, compared with the 14 percent drop in France.German automotive companies regard their success as the payoff for years of investment in foreign markets, and would clearly resent any of their European competitors’ receiving government support. A spokesman for the German Association of the Automotive Industry declined on Friday to comment on Peugeot’s situation. But he referred to a speech last week by the president of the group, Matthias Wissmann, who implicitly criticized state aid for weak carmakers.“It would be better if everyone were to improve their own competitiveness,” Mr. Wissmann said in Berlin. “The principle must apply, also in Europe, that we orient ourselves on the strong, not on the weak.”German manufacturers sold nearly 1.3 million cars in the United States last year, a 21 percent increase over 2011. Although Fiat has also begun a renewed push into the U.S. market, thanks to its control of Chrysler, right now the German automakers are the only European manufacturers with a strong presence there.Volvo Cars of Sweden also has a long tradition in the United States, but its sales of 68,000 vehicles last year were far behind the Germans.But German government support for its auto industry is not unheard of. In 2009, Chancellor Angela Merkel pledged €4.5 billion in aid to General Motors’ Opel unit if it were sold to a components supplier, Magna. The money was never paid because G.M. backed out of the deal.In addition, the German state of Lower Saxony has long held 20 percent of the voting shares of Volkswagen, which has its headquarters there. The stake gives the state government effective veto power over major decisions. Still, in recent years Volkswagen, which is profitable, has subsidized the state rather than the other way around.The mixed message sent by officials in Paris on Friday echoed the situation last autumn during a protracted industrial dispute with the Luxembourg-based steel giant ArcelorMittal. The issue then was Arcelor’s plans to close two blast furnaces in Florange, in eastern France.At one point in that face-off, Industry Minister Arnaud Montebourg threatened to nationalize the entire Florange complex if the steel maker did not reverse its plans. But he made the threat even as the French government was trying to lure foreign investors through an advertising campaign with the tag line “Say oui to France” and otherwise trumpeting its efforts to increase France’s industrial competitiveness.In the end, Mr. Montebourg was largely excluded from the final negotiations, and Arcelor was able to carry out its program essentially as planned, after some compromises that enabled the Hollande government to save face.After that politically bruising battle, Mr. Ayrault, the prime minister, sought in January to outline the government’s industrial policy. He said the state would consider investing in companies when they were engaged in projects that, while not immediately profitable, could eventually yield major payoffs, or when the survival of a “strategic” enterprise was at stake.France has long considered the automotive sector, which directly employs more than 200,000 people, to be strategic. But, of course, so does the United States, which is why the Obama administration was willing to bail out General Motors and Chrysler in 2009.The French government, which holds a stake of about 15 percent in Renault, is already deeply involved with Peugeot. Last autumn, the state extended credit guarantees worth €7 billion to the company’s finance unit, to ensure that customers could still get loans at competitive rates, despite the company’s own deteriorating balance sheet. That move gave the government a seat on the Peugeot board and the right to review the company’s operations. European competition authorities in Brussels, who are reviewing those guarantees, would scrutinize any additional support.Peugeot, meanwhile, sold a 7 percent stake last year to General Motors, which is struggling to turn around its own European unit, Adam Opel. Peugeot initially described the deal as a global alliance, but so far analysts have been underwhelmed by the loose affiliation, which is mainly about logistics and a few vehicle projects.Ian Fletcher, an analyst at IHS Automotive in London, said Peugeot needed to carry out its restructuring plans, which call for the closure of a plant in Aulnay-sous-Bois, near Paris, and a reduction of 11,200 jobs from its French work force of roughly 97,000.But it is not in dire need of government money, he said, because the company has built up enough of a cash nest egg that it could become profitable again, if it makes it through the restructuring and — a big if — the European market rebounds by early 2015.In the short term, an infusion of investment capital from the French government “would be great” for Peugeot, Mr. Fletcher said. But over the longer term, he added, “it might create more problems than it solved.”Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/us-trade-deficit-shrinks.html,"The United States economy most likely expanded slightly in the fourth quarter, instead of contracting, according to trade data released Friday that suggested a surprise drop in gross domestic product reported last week may have been overstated.The country’s trade deficit narrowed to $38.5 billion in December, its lowest reading in nearly three years, Commerce Department data showed. The decrease was driven by a drop in oil imports and a surge in exports. The overall trade gap was far smaller than analysts polled by Reuters had expected.“Trade data for December paint a reassuring and encouraging picture of the U.S. economy at the end of last year,” said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.A separate report from the Commerce Department showed that wholesale inventories unexpectedly declined in December, a factor that could hamper the stronger trade figures’ effect on growth.Still, the two reports together suggested the government could revise up its reading on fourth-quarter G.D.P., which showed the economy contracting at a 0.1 percent annual rate. That decline was driven by an expected drop in exports, smaller gains in inventories and a plunge in military spending.Barclays said that even with December’s decline in wholesale inventories, the economy most likely expanded 0.3 percent in the fourth quarter, thanks to the higher export numbers in Friday’s trade report.American exports increased by $8.6 billion in December over the year-ago month, lifted by sales of industrial supplies, including a $1.2 billion rise from November in nonmonetary gold.Reflecting the country’s current boom in oil and natural gas, petroleum exports rose by nearly $1 billion during the month to a record high.A fall in petroleum purchases led overall imports to decline by $4.6 billion in December from the year-ago period.For the entire year, the country’s imports of crude oil fell to their lowest levels since 1997 in terms of volume.Stocks prices on American exchanges rose as investors took note of the strong trade data, which included the United States figures as well as readings showing stronger exports and imports in China during January. The price of the benchmark 10-year Treasury note also rose.For all of 2012, the United States trade gap shrank by 3.5 percent, to $540.4 billion. Running trade deficits means the country loses dollars, which drags on the economy; rising exports reduce that effect.Exports last year rose 4.4 percent.Even the American trade balance with China had a silver lining. While imports from China increased to a record high last year, so did American exports there. The December trade deficit in goods with China, not seasonally adjusted, narrowed by $4.5 billion from the previous month on a drop in imports.Also in December, United States wholesale inventories unexpectedly fell as auto dealers and agricultural suppliers drew down their stocks.The Commerce Department said stocks of unsold goods at wholesalers dropped 0.1 percent during the month and grew less than initially estimated in November.Economists polled by Reuters had expected wholesale inventories to rise 0.4 percent."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/aol-profit-rises-on-strong-ad-sales.html,"AOL reported its best quarterly revenue growth in eight years because of strong search and advertising sales, and its shares rose sharply.The company said Friday that total revenue rose 4 percent to nearly $600 million in the fourth quarter, beating analysts’ estimates of $573.7 million, according to Thomson Reuters.Advertising revenue, an important measurement for the company as it moves away from subscription-based dial-up services and emphasizes its media properties like The Huffington Post and Patch, rose 13 percent to $410.6 million.It was advertising sold through AOL’s third-party network that helped lift overall revenue. Revenue jumped 37 percent to $183.5 million at AOL Networks, a market to sell inventory on behalf of publishers.Net income rose to $35.7 million, or 41 cents per share, in the fourth quarter from $22.8 million, or 23 cents per share, a year earlier. Earnings per share were in line with analysts’ estimates.While advertising sales represent AOL’s future growth, the subscription unit, which is now called the membership group and includes the legacy dial-up service, is still providing the bulk of profit.Excluding special items, operating income before depreciation and amortization for the membership group was $158.7 million for the quarter, representing the vast majority of the total.“It’s not great to see so much of the bottom-line contribution coming from the revenue segment in decline,” said Ken Sen, an analyst at Evercore. Mr. Sena said the company has made “steady progress” over the past two years, but “still has a ways to go.”AOL’s board also authorized the repurchase of $100 million in stock."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/world/americas/us-use-of-mexican-battery-recyclers-is-faulted.html,"United States companies are sending spent lead batteries to recycling plants in Mexico that do not meet American environmental standards, according to an environmental agency created under the North American Free Trade Agreement, putting Mexican communities at risk.In a blistering report submitted this week, the agency, the Commission for Environmental Cooperation, notes that the United States does not fully follow procedures common among developed nations that treat international battery shipments as hazardous waste. It faults environmental agencies on both sides of the border for lapses in regulation and enforcement. Cross-border trade in lead batteries increased by up to 525 percent from 2004 to 2011, the report said.The report, which has been circulating in draft form, has been forwarded to the governments of the United States, Canada and Mexico, which have 60 days to object to its publication. An estimated 20 percent of lead acid batteries from the United States now go to Mexico for recycling, according to trade statistics.“There needs to be better coordination between government agencies and better cross-border tracking,” said Evan Lloyd, who was the agency’s executive director until late last year and oversaw the yearlong study.The report highlighted a number of shortcomings: Customs data on the number of batteries crossing the border did not mesh with counts by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. Though the E.P.A. requires notice of batteries leaving the United States, there was no effort to make sure that they had arrived at qualified recyclers in Mexico. The data that battery companies sent to the E.P.A. about exports consisted of “piles of paper,” Mr. Lloyd said, and it was never amassed into an electronic database that would be “useful to regulators.”Almost all lead acid batteries used in the United States are recycled to extract the lead for reuse because lead is a dangerous pollutant and because it is a valuable commodity. Lead batteries are used in vehicles, cellphone towers and wind turbines.Since 2008, new United States limits on lead pollution have made domestic recycling complicated and costly. That has helped propel the recycling trade to Mexico, both legally and illegally, environmental groups say, because that country has less stringent limits for lead pollution, and far less vigorous enforcement.“There’s a pretty consistent pattern suggesting that exports are the direct result of U.S. emissions standards,” said Perry Gottesfeld, executive director of Occupational Knowledge International, which has led the campaign against lead poisoning internationally. Mr. Gottesfeld noted that a Mexican plant owned by a major American recycler, Johnson Controls Inc., puts out more than 30 times as much lead emissions as its newest plant in the United States.“What Mexico needs to do is to get its recycling up to U.S. standards, and the U.S. needs to do a much better job of tracking batteries overseas,” he said. In an e-mail, Johnson Controls, based in Milwaukee, said it was “modernizing and reinvesting” in the Mexican facility, acquired in 2005, “to reduce its environmental footprint.”The report was initiated in response to a report by Occupational Knowledge International and Fronteras Comunes, a Mexican environmental group, as well as to an investigative article in The New York Times, Mr. Lloyd said. Soil collected by The Times in a school playground near a recycling plant outside Mexico City was found to have lead levels five times those allowed in the United States.Lead poisoning causes high blood pressure, kidney damage and abdominal pain in adults, and serious developmental delays and behavioral problems in young children. When batteries are broken for recycling, the lead is released as dust and, during melting, as lead-laced emissions.In the United States, recyclers operate in highly mechanized, tightly sealed plants, with smokestack scrubbers and extensive monitors to detect lead release. Plants in Mexico vary greatly in safety standards, and in some, the recycling process is little more than men with hammers smashing batteries and melting down their contents in furnaces.In recent months, there have been new efforts to curb the flow of batteries south of the border, though many battery makers have fought that. In response to a draft of the report released late last year, Battery Council International, an industry group, said it opposed “the creation of additional burdensome certification programs.”Last year, the United States General Services Administration, which is responsible for federal vehicles, asked ASTM International, an independent standards agency, to explore a voluntary standard for battery recycling.But that effort came to naught after the proposal was voted down at an open meeting attended by representatives from industry, government and environmental groups in December. Of the 103 people at the meeting, 49 worked for Johnson Controls."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/global/european-union-budget-talks.html,"BRUSSELSAs European Union leaders began their 14th hour of budget negotiations after a sleepless night, Valdis Dombrovskis, the prime minister of Latvia, took the floor early Friday to address what, for his Baltic nation of around two million people, is a vital question: Why should a Latvian cow deserve less money than a French, Dutch or even Romanian one?In a system that requires unanimous approval of budget decisions, what Latvia wants for its dairy farmers — or Estonia for its railways, Hungary for its poorer regions or Spain for its fishermen — is no small matter. It is this cacophony of local concerns that explains why, despite Germany’s outsize role in decision-making, the European Union has such trouble reaching an agreement on something as basic as a budget.And if simply agreeing to a budget is so daunting to member countries, it raises serious questions about the limits of the political and economic integration that have long been the master plan for champions of European unity.After a failed attempt to set spending targets at a summit meeting in November and in a 24-hour marathon of talks this week, European leaders finally agreed late Friday to a common budget for the next seven years.The new budget, which is slightly smaller than its predecessor — the first decrease in the European Union’s history — reflects the climate of austerity across a Continent still struggling to emerge from a crippling debt crisis.The colossal effort that was required to agree to a sum of about 960 billion euros ($1.3 trillion), a mere 1 percent of the bloc’s gross domestic product over the life of the budget, exposed once again the stubborn attachment to national priorities that has made reaching agreements on how to save the euro so painful in recent years.“We need to agree, and to agree we need to take into account all countries,” Mr. Dombrovskis said in an interview. The Latvian leader, who rushed to his hotel for a shave, shower and change of shirt in the middle of the night, described the ordeal as “not a pleasant experience,” but said, “It only happens every seven years, so we can tolerate it.”But tolerating is not the same thing as cooperating.“What we’re seeing is that European integration is very important to European leaders as long as it doesn’t imply that someone has to be paying for someone else,” said Daniel Gros, director of the Center for European Policy Studies, a research organization in Brussels. “Sharing a European budget is not going to be the essence of the E.U., but crafting the rule books for open borders and stable banking systems will be.”The spectacle of European leaders haggling through the night over amounts of money representing rounding errors in their national accounts demonstrated vividly their reluctance to make collective policies that erode their nations’ sovereignty.“The budget negotiations are the most visible sign of member states winning and losing from the European Union,” said Hugo Brady, a senior research fellow at the Center for European Reform, a research organization. “The result is a totally parochial budget that is poorly adapted to rapidly changing times.”Before it becomes law, the deal faces yet another hurdle in the European Parliament, which has the power to veto the budget.Some of the most influential figures in Parliament have already signaled that they are prepared to reject a budget that would spend less on Europe in the years ahead.Martin Schulz, the president of Parliament, said this week that he would not approve a budget that widened the gap between the cash governments pay up front and the somewhat higher amounts, called commitments, that make up the overall budget.Britain, Sweden and the Netherlands were among the Northern European nations that fought hard to reduce agricultural subsidies and increase spending on research and development to bolster the bloc’s global competitiveness.Despite those efforts, farm spending remained the largest single portion of the budget, accounting for about 38 percent of the total — although that was down from about 42 percent in the previous seven-year budget period.Galileo, a grossly overbudget and still unfinished satellite navigation project that aims to free Europe from its dependence on the United States’ global positioning system, escaped the cuts and is to receive 6.3 billion euros from 2014 to 2020.At a news conference on Friday, President François Hollande of France, who had lobbied hard against cuts and in favor of what Paris promoted as a more “European” approach, lamented the overall shape of the deal. But he cheered the preservation of heavy spending on farm subsidies, of which France is the biggest beneficiary.“The problem in Europe is that we are not alone, so this is not the agreement I wanted,” Mr. Hollande said. But he described the deal as “the best possible under current constraints and circumstances.”Some of the deepest cuts from initial proposals by the European Commission were made to a Pan-European project called the Connecting Europe Facility, which aims to improve transport, energy and digital services. And about 1 billion euros in cuts came from the part of the budget used to employ 55,000 people, including 6,000 translators, most of them in Brussels, who run the bloc’s day-to-day affairs.Herman Van Rompuy, president of the European Council, which organizes summit meetings, is already seeking to head off a parliamentary showdown over the budget. At a news conference on Friday, Mr. Van Rompuy sought to assure Parliament that enough flexibility would be built into the budget to ensure that member states paid all of their bills on time.Mr. Van Rompuy warned Parliament that it should make sure it “reflects carefully” before rejecting the budget, “because for the population, for businesses, for jobs, jobs for young people, for prosperity, there is a great deal at stake,” he said.But national interests were on parade. Among the leaders playing most assiduously to a home audience was David Cameron, the British prime minister. He appeared to have delivered on his pledge to reduce the total amount of upfront cash payments by countries like Britain, a net contributor to the European Union budget.Mr. Cameron declared Friday’s outcome “a good deal for Britain and a good deal for Europe.” But he devoted much of a postsummit news conference to boasting about his steadfast defense of British interests, particularly a multibillion-dollar rebate that Britain receives each year on its payments. “I battled off every attempt to change it in any way,” he said.Mr. Cameron faces a domestic political challenge from a small but noisy and fiercely anti-European Union political party, the UK Independence Party. Last month he announced that if he won the next election, he would let Britons vote in a referendum on pulling out of the bloc.His domestic political calculations are replicated across Europe. Leaders in each country face a host of parochial pressures that matter little beyond their nations’ borders but on which their own political futures hinge.In the Baltic nations, for example, farmers are furious that a system of cash payments to support agriculture is skewed in favor of farmers from richer countries like France and the Netherlands.Latvian farmers say they get less than 40 percent of the European Union’s average payment level for each acre of land. Dairy farmers say they fare even worse, getting just 20 percent of what their Dutch counterparts receive.“This is a big issue for us,” said Mr. Dombrovskis, the prime minister. “It is a big political issue in Latvia.”The agreement reached Friday does not alter this discrepancy. But it does enshrine a previous pledge to narrow the gap considerably by 2020, and it opens the way for national governments to provide additional subsidies of their own — something generally not allowed under current European Union rules governing agriculture.“I wouldn’t say I’m happy,” Mr. Dombrovskis said, “but we agreed.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/following-a-herd-of-bulls-on-apples-stock.html,"Last September, Apple shares hit a record $705. And to the overwhelming majority of Wall Street analysts, that meant one thing: buy.By November, with Apple stock in the midst of a precipitous decline, they were still bullish. Fifty of 57 analysts rated it a buy or strong buy; only two rated it a sell. Apple shares continued their plunge, and this week were trading at just over $450, down 36 percent from their peak.How could professional analysts have gotten it so wrong?It wasn’t supposed to be this way. A decade ago, Congressional hearings and an investigation by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, exposed a maze of conflicts of interest afflicting Wall Street research. There were some notorious examples of analysts who curried favor with investment banking clients and potential clients by producing favorable research, and then were paid huge bonuses out of investment banking fees. Many investors and regulators blamed analysts’ overly bullish forecasts for helping to inflate the dot-com bubble that burst in 2000.After a global settlement of Mr. Spitzer’s investigation by major investment banks and the Sarbanes-Oxley reform legislation in 2002, investment banking and research operations were segregated. Conflicts had to be disclosed, and research and analyst pay was detached from investment banking revenues, among other measures.These reforms seem to have worked — but only up to a point. Other conflicts have come to the fore, especially at large brokerage firms and investment banks. And studies have shown that analysts are prone to other influences — like following the herd — that can undermine their judgments. “The reforms didn’t necessarily make analysts better at their jobs,” said Stuart C. Gilson, a professor of finance at Harvard Business School.It may be no coincidence that the only analyst who even came close to calling the peak in Apple’s stock runs his own firm and is compensated based on the accuracy of his calls. Carlo R. Besenius, founder and chief executive of Creative Global Investments, downgraded Apple to sell last Oct. 3, with shares trading at $685. In December, he lowered his price target to $420, and this week he told me he may drop it even further, to $320.Mr. Besenius founded his firm a decade ago after spending many years in research at Merrill Lynch and Lehman Brothers. “I saw so many conflicts of interest in trading, investment banking and research, so I started a conflict-free company,” he said this week from Luxembourg, where he was born and now lives. “Wall Street is full of conflicts. It still is and always will be. It’s incompetent at picking stocks.”Since the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley, several studies have documented a decline in the percentage of analysts’ buy recommendations, albeit a modest one, while sell recommendations have increased. “Before 2002, analyst recommendations were tilted toward optimistic at an extreme rate,” Ohad Kadan, a professor of finance at Washington University in St. Louis, and co-author of one of the studies, told me this week. “That’s still true today, but it’s not as extreme. It’s a little more balanced.”While investment banking conflicts have been addressed, “the most obvious conflict now is that research is funded through the trading desks,” Professor Gilson said. “If you’re an analyst and one way your report brings in revenue is through increased trading, a buy recommendation will do this more than a sell. For a sell, you have to already own the stock to generate a trade. But anybody can potentially buy a stock. That’s one hypothesis about why you still see a disproportionate number of buy recommendations.” That may be especially true for heavily traded stocks like Apple, which generate huge commissions for Wall Street.But no one thinks conflicts alone can explain the analysts’ abysmal recent Apple performance. “There’s too much unanimity,” Bruce Greenwald, a professor of finance and asset management at Columbia Business School and a renowned value investor, told me this week. “That’s what’s so troubling. When that many analysts are in agreement, they can’t all be conflicted.”He and other experts say there are additional documented factors that help explain why Wall Street analysts are so often wrong: they extrapolate from recent performance data; they chase momentum; they want to please their customers; and they show a tendency toward herd behavior. Which is to say, they fall into the same pitfalls that afflict most investors.“Why aren’t they more sophisticated? You’d hope they would be,” Professor Kadan said. “But they always fall into the same traps.”Professor Greenwald agreed. “When something goes up, they all put out buy recommendations. Their models extrapolate past performance into the future. They chase momentum. With Apple, they were right at $600, and they were right at $650, which reinforced the trend. So why would they be wrong at $700?”Professor Kadan said that momentum investing has its adherents, and is often right, at least in the short term that many investors focus on. “You’d hope that analysts, of all people, would be able to anticipate an abrupt reversal, but they’re not very good at it. They loved Apple at $700. I’m sure they were trying to do their best, but they’re prisoners of momentum.”Another factor is that analysts have a tendency to tell their audience what it wants to hear. “The analysts are in the end sales people,” Professor Greenwald said. “Their credibility depends on their not upsetting their investors too much. Everybody loved Apple, everybody did well. The bears were always wrong. It took an enormous amount of courage to fight the tide.”Professor Kadan agreed. “Analysts tend to herd. There’s no big penalty if you’re wrong, because everyone else is wrong. You’ve got cover. You’re not going to lose your job. If you take a different opinion, either you get a big prize if you’re right, or you lose your job. An analyst needs to be really courageous to say something different from most other analysts.”Mr. Besenius, the one analyst who downgraded Apple near its peak, said, “I’m not afraid to make big, controversial calls,” but attributed his decision less to courage than to survival. “I’m paid based on performance,” he said. “I have to go to my clients and explain why they should pay for my research when they can get it for nothing from the firms where they pay their trading commissions.”Mr. Besenius based his recommendation on technical factors — as Apple hit $700, its upward momentum and trading volume were slowing — as well as more fundamental concerns about product quality and innovation, as well as growing competition from rivals like Samsung. And there were more subjective factors. Mr. Besenius said he became uncomfortable with what he deemed Apple’s arrogance. “I loved Steve Jobs,” he said. “He built a great company. But he was one of the most arrogant C.E.O.’s I’ve ever met. The way he introduced new products was one big display of arrogance. He ridiculed Microsoft as ‘Micro who?’ That’s a good reason to be cautious. A little humility is a good thing.” (An Apple spokesman declined to comment on Mr. Besenius’s observations.)It galls Mr. Besenius that market regulators don’t measure the performance of Wall Street’s research recommendations, and he said he believed that they should require firms to disclose the track records of stocks their analysts recommend. “They’re not being held accountable” for bad recommendations, he maintained. “Little firms like ours have to be better than the big firms. We have to prove we can add value. Otherwise, we wouldn’t have an existence.”Apple is only one prominent example of egg on analysts’ faces, and bullish Wall Street analysts were right for years — until they were wrong. Even today, analysts remain overwhelmingly positive about Apple. This week, 44 analysts rated it a strong buy or buy, although 10 now rate it a hold, according to Thomson Reuters.Should anyone listen?Many brokers still rely on their analysts’ research, and offer the analysts’ reports to clients for guidance in picking stocks to buy and sell. But the Securities and Exchange Commission takes a skeptical approach. Despite the reforms it helped put in place, it warns on its Web site of continuing conflicts of interest and says flatly, “As a general matter, investors should not rely solely on an analyst’s recommendation when deciding whether to buy, hold, or sell a stock.” It notes that many brokers aren’t allowed to contradict recommendations from their own research departments.Professor Gilson of Harvard said: “Analysts are like movie critics. Some are good and some are bad. I find some of them extraordinarily useful. I advise my students to look to them, but you have to read their recommendations smartly with a very critical eye.”Professor Greenwald was more dismissive. “I never pay attention to them, “ he said. “When a dog barks, if the dog barks all the time, you stop paying attention.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/business/global/chinese-imports-and-exports-soar-in-january.html,"HONG KONG — January trade data from China on Friday showed a surge in exports and imports from the levels of a year earlier — a phenomenon largely due to the timing of the Lunar New Year holiday but also supporting the view that the Chinese economy is firming up.Economic data from China are often severely distorted by the holiday,  when many factories shut down for a week or more.The holiday this year takes place in February — the first day of the Lunar New Year is Sunday. Last year it fell squarely in January, cutting down on the number of working days during that month.The trade data released Friday reflected this with a large increase, compared with the year before, as analysts had expected. Exports climbed 25 percent from January 2012, according to the General Administration of Customs, and imports rose 28.8 percent.The increases were much lower when adjusted for the holiday-induced differences in the number of working days, with exports up 12.4 percent and imports just 3.4 percent higher.Still, the data beat expectations by a wide margin, supporting the view that healthier domestic and overseas demand also had been significant.“This strong export number cannot be fully explained by the Chinese New Year effect alone,” Zhiwei Zhang, chief China economist at Nomura in Hong Kong, said in a research note. “These data suggest that external and domestic demand are both strong, which supports our view that the economy is on track for a cyclical recovery” in the first half of this year, he added.Dariusz Kowalczyk, an economist at Crédit Agricole in Hong Kong, said, “We need to wait for February results to have the full picture of trade at the start of 2013.” However, he added, “one trend is clear: exports have been doing very well recently. This may be a sign of improved external demand but is also a testimony to the resilience of Chinese exporters and to their competitiveness.”Improved overseas demand and a string of government-mandated stimulus measures have gradually propped up growth and dispelled fears of a hard landing in China. While the Chinese economy expanded just 7.8 percent last year — down from 9.3 percent in 2011 and 10.4 percent in 2010 — many analysts expect growth to top 8 percent again in 2013.Central bank data Friday that showed ample money had continued to flood into the economy also supported this view. Banks extended 1.07 trillion renminbi, or $172 billion, in new loans during January, more than analysts had expected. Total “social financing aggregate” in the economy, a broad measure of liquidity, or the ease of trading assets, more than doubled from a year earlier, to 2.54 trillion renminbi.That figure, Mr. Kowalczyk commented, was a “blowout number.”Like other data released Friday, the financing figure was lifted by the Lunar New Year effects, but even without these, Mr. Kowalczyk said, it was a “huge amount of funding” and would sustain solid economic growth in the near term at least.Longer term, he cautioned, it would also “stoke inflationary pressures,” and could lead the central bank to tighten monetary policy further down the line as it seeks to stave off inflationary pressures.For now, inflation remains benign. Consumer prices rose just 2 percent in January from a year earlier, a moderation from the 2.5 percent year-on-year increase in December. The low inflation number, released Friday, was in line with forecasts, but analysts widely expect a rebound in February."

But some economists say raising marginal income tax rates on high earners may miss the mark.One reason is that the truly wealthy employ all kinds of legal means to minimize their tax liability, including shifting income around the world, deferring gains on their assets and many other sophisticated strategies. Another, though, is that taxes on ordinary income simply don’t apply to inheritance or investment, principal sources of wealth.Under legislation that Congress approved on New Year’s Day the top marginal income tax rate for 2013 has risen to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individuals on ordinary income over $400,000 and for couples on income over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits start phasing out on income as low as $250,000. But what is being taxed is often just a small portion of the income and wealth of the very richest Americans; unearned income, including unrealized gains and gains on investments, is either not taxed or taxed at a fraction of the top rate on wages.Taxing wealth in addition to income is one way to make sure that the rich contribute more to government coffers. That would essentially be a tax on household assets like property, stocks, bonds, unincorporated businesses, trusts, art and yachts.The idea is to aim at the wealthiest part of the population, perhaps the top 1 percent, a group that has seen the most significant and consistent accumulation of wealth over the last few decades.“A wealth tax is an attempt to fill the holes in income tax,” said Douglas A. Shackelford, a tax expert at the University of North Carolina. “The primary hole is unrealized capital gains. That’s behind the big buildup of dynastic wealth.”COUNTRIES like Canada have a tax on asset appreciation, based on the value of the assets at the time of the owner’s death. The United States does not, and the tax code contains a huge loophole through which to pass wealth to one’s heirs.Here is how that can work in practice:A billionaire can borrow against his stocks, art and real estate, and spend that borrowed money without paying tax. All he has to do is pay interest on the loan. When he dies, his heirs can sell the assets to pay off the debt. Under an existing rule known as the “step-up in basis,” no matter how much the assets have appreciated in value, no one will owe income tax on that gain. And the rest of his fortune goes to his heirs without anyone ever paying income taxes on the appreciation in the assets.Partly to close loopholes like this, Ronald I. McKinnon, an economist at Stanford, advocates a wealth tax in addition to income tax. He outlined his proposal in a recent op-ed article in The Wall Street Journal titled “The Conservative Case for a Wealth Tax.”Professor McKinnon’s plan would require households to list all domestic and foreign assets annually. There would be a $3 million wealth exemption, which, in his estimation, would exclude more than 95 percent of the population. The remainder would be subject to a flat tax of about 3 percent of household wealth.In Europe, in addition to a wealth tax, many countries have a value-added, or consumption tax. Because the idea of a consumption tax is politically unpopular in the United States, he said in an interview, “I think the case is even stronger in the U.S.”“Plus,” he added, “the income tax is a poor vehicle for hitting the wealthy.”Other economists say that a wealth tax would also address other problems.“Wealth inequality and lack of access to opportunity is destroying the meritocratic aspects of our economy,” said Daniel Altman, an economist at New York University and a former member of the editorial board of The New York Times. “That will cost us growth in the long run.”Mr. Altman proposes replacing the income tax with a wealth tax. He estimates that a flat wealth tax of 1.5 percent would be more than enough to replace the revenue from current income, estate and gift taxes. But he proposes establishing tax brackets according to wealth levels. For instance, no tax might be imposed for a household’s first $500,000 in wealth, 1 percent for the next $500,000 and 2 percent for wealth above $1 million.Proponents of a wealth tax also say it would encourage innovation and risk-taking because it wouldn’t tax wealth in its early phases, but only after it has been amassed.There are several main criticisms. For one, valuing unfamiliar assets — say, private businesses or art collections — would not be easy. A related issue is liquidity, as an owner may not be able to readily obtain cash based on the value of the assets in question. And some fear a negative effect on capital formation.There are also possible legal roadblocks. Matthew J. Franck, writing for National Review Online, said instituting a wealth tax might require a constitutional amendment. A similar concern haunted proponents of the income tax until ratification of the 16th Amendment in 1913.IT is unclear whether the idea of a wealth tax will ever gain traction in the United States. But longtime deficit problems remain, and tax increases of some type may well be part of the solution. According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States raised less tax revenue in 2010 as a proportion of gross domestic product than any other industrialized nation, aside from Chile and Mexico.“Should we reform the income tax, the estate tax or bring in a third tax like the wealth tax?” asked Professor Shackleford at the University of North Carolina. “We have to do something. There’s a tremendous amount of tax escaping because we don’t tax the deceased and we don’t tax the heirs.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/sunday-review/its-not-easy-being-green.html,"WASHINGTONGREEN jobs have long had a whiff of exaggeration to them. The alternative-energy sector may ultimately employ millions of people. But raising the cost of the energy that households and businesses use every day — a necessary effect of helping the climate — is not exactly a recipe for an economic boom.The stronger argument for a major government response to climate change is the more obvious argument: climate change. The continental United States endured its hottest year on record in 2012, and the planet’s 13 hottest years have all occurred since 1998. Major storms and wildfires are increasing in many regions. The air in much of China resembles soup. The seas are rising faster than forecast only a few years ago, and the costs of extreme weather are rising, too.In Washington, the economic case for responding to climate change has made little progress, with Democrats failing to pass a sweeping bill when they controlled Congress and Republicans remaining strongly opposed. And President Obama has subtly shifted his approach, talking less about green jobs and more about extreme weather.As he prepares to deliver the first State of the Union address of his second term, on Tuesday night, he and his advisers face some big decisions on climate policy. One is how to make the biggest dent in carbon emissions through executive-branch actions, given the long odds of Congress’s passing any substantial bill. Another is to rethink the economics of climate policy now that the early burst of green-job enthusiasm has waned.Alternative energy may not be a solution to our economic problems. But neither is it guaranteed to make those problems much worse, despite the continuing claims of opponents. Mr. Obama has a range of options with the potential to have different economic consequences. Some may indeed do harm, but others could have economic benefits that equal their costs, particularly in a world in which temperatures, storms and uncertainty just keep rising.The most intriguing choice facing Mr. Obama is whether to resuscitate a version of the centerpiece of the Democrats’ failed 2009 climate push: a cap-and-trade program. He has little chance of creating such an economywide program, because Republicans and some coal-state Democrats oppose it. But he may be able to create a scaled-down version specifically for power plants — no small thing, given that power plants produce about one-third of the country’s carbon emissions.To economists, the best climate policies are those that allow market incentives to work, and the most damaging tend to be those heavy on mandates. “Telling companies they have to install this or that equipment is the more expensive way to proceed,” says Michael Greenstone, an M.I.T. economist and former Obama administration adviser. “Instead of a one-size-fits-all solution, you should allow companies to find the least-cost solution.”Mandating that every power plant use turbines with a minimum efficiency, for instance, is likely to impose large costs on some. Perhaps the plants are designed in a way that makes it easier — and cheaper — for them to use their old turbines and reduce emissions another way. A turbine mandate could force them to raise prices for consumers more than necessary to achieve the same climate benefit.A cap-and-trade system works differently. It requires companies to buy permits for their emissions and allows the companies to decide how best to meet their targets. A company that finds inexpensive ways to reduce emissions can sell its unused permits to companies that would have had to spend large sums to reduce emissions, lowering prices for everyone.In previous decades, the United States reduced acid rainfall and the levels of lead in gasoline through similar approaches, both at lower costs than predicted.White House officials have already signaled that Mr. Obama is likely to use a 2007 Supreme Court decision — which gave the Environmental Protection Agency authority to regulate greenhouse gases — to regulate existing power plants. In the first term, the E.P.A. relied on that decision to negotiate a steep increase in fuel-economy standards with automakers and to overhaul standards for newly constructed power plants. The rules for new power plants would effectively halt the construction of new coal plants.Those rules relied mostly on mandates, like requiring automakers to have a certain average fuel efficiency across their entire fleet. And mandates can indeed reduce carbon emissions. In the second term, aides say Mr. Obama may also mandate that home appliances and office buildings produce fewer emissions.BUT even largely successful mandates, like the one on autos, often bring little-noticed costs. So environmental economists are watching to see if Mr. Obama will also take steps to keep economic growth at the center of his climate policy, by attempting to regulate existing power plants with market-friendly permits.Such a step would most likely draw legal challenges, but so would any move by the administration to regulate power-plant emissions.The system would not be a true cap-and-trade program, because it would lack a nationwide cap on power-plant emissions, notes Nathaniel Keohane, a vice president at the Environmental Defense Fund and another former White House economist. Still, the system would create credits that efficient plants could sell to less efficient plants.The program would still be vulnerable to political caricature as a “cap-and-tax” program, much as the 2009 cap-and-trade bill was. This time, though, individual Congress members would not need to vote for it. The administration could implement it, fight for it in the courts — and hope, as in the past, that the costs end up being far lower than critics predict.“Realistically, there is very little prospect of progress in this Congress,” Mr. Keohane told me. “Ultimately, we have to have a comprehensive policy,” he argued, given the scale of the problem. “But we can get started in the short run.”Beyond a market-based system, financing for research is a second major way Washington can try to slow climate change without harming economic growth. The federal government will spend $3.8 billion this year on clean-energy research and development, according to the Brookings Institution.It is a tiny sum relative to the $30 billion for medical research or the $15 billion for agriculture subsidies, let alone the $800 billion for Social Security. A cross-ideological report, from the American Enterprise Institute, the Breakthrough Institute and the Brookings Institution, has recommended an additional $25 billion a year for alternative energy.Of course, in the current fiscal and partisan environment, so much additional financing is about as likely to pass Congress as a carbon tax. The more realistic hope, many scientists and economists say, is for the government to spend its existing money more effectively.The small Energy Department program Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy, known as Arpa-e — modeled after Darpa, the Pentagon research lab that built the Internet — should be a model, say Mr. Greenstone and others. The program finances high-risk research when the private sector is unlikely to find it profitable and makes decisions based on peer review. But Arpa-e is the exception, and much federal research spending has lower odds of major success.The government could play a further role by making its own buildings and operations more energy efficient. Doing so could have a modest effect on the country’s total emissions. Perhaps more important, it could bolster the nascent market for alternative energy.In some cases, such changes may even save taxpayers money over the long run. In most cases, however, they probably will not. Government agencies, like households and businesses, use dirty energy today because it is cheaper. And while it’s true that new clean-energy companies may help the economy by earning profits and employing workers, the same is true of coal and oil companies.The two sides in the climate debate have spent recent years offering dueling — and dubious — economic claims. Switching to more expensive, cleaner energy does not promise a free lunch of more prosperity and a healthier planet. But it also does not need to result in stagnation. A federal climate response brings a mix of costs and benefits, and the specific policies that Mr. Obama and Congress pursue will help determine the balance.In the end, the strongest economic argument for an aggressive response to climate change is not the much trumpeted windfall of green jobs. It’s the fact that the economy won’t function very well in a world full of droughts, hurricanes and heat waves."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/after-hurricane-sandy-a-mound-of-tax-loss-math.html,"PEOPLE who lost their homes or suffered extensive property damage in Hurricane Sandy may qualify for some help from the Internal Revenue Service, but with the usual caveats: the tax code isn’t simple, and not everybody will qualify.Still, income tax deductions are available for some people who have major losses from a casualty, which the Internal Revenue Service defines as “the damage, destruction or loss of property from an identifiable event that is sudden, unexpected or unusual.” Do you qualify, though? The I.R.S. provides a workbook, Publication 584, to help figure it out.For one thing, the losses can be deducted only if they are more than 10 percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income plus $100.In addition, the deduction applies only to uninsured losses, according to Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y. Any insurance payments for damaged or destroyed property have to be subtracted from the loss, which makes homeowners who did not have flood insurance more likely to be eligible.Any payments that storm victims received from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for repairs to damaged or destroyed homes or their replacement must also be deducted from a casualty loss, according to Anthony Burke, an I.R.S. spokesman. Other FEMA payments, like those for food and temporary housing, do not have to be deducted, he said.Beyond deducting insurance and FEMA payments, some people who start calculating their losses will bump into rules on fair market value.The value of destroyed property is what it was worth just before the storm, not what it was worth when it was new or what it cost to replace.Sidney Kess, an accountant and lawyer at Kostelanetz & Fink in Manhattan, gave an example of someone whose car, bought five years ago for $25,000, was submerged in salt water and destroyed and who received the $10,000 book value of that car from an insurance company. If a similar-model new car was then bought for $30,000, that person may think “I took a beating,” Mr. Kess said. But there is no loss for tax purposes, he explained, because the person has recovered the fair market value of a five-year-old car.Some property, though, doesn’t lose much value over the years. If waterlogged walls have to be replaced, for example, the repair bill will most likely be the amount of the casualty loss.“The cost of repairs to damaged property is acceptable as evidence of the value of the loss,” as long as the value of the repairs doesn’t increase the value of the property beyond its prestorm value, Robert S. Barnett and Elizabeth Forspan, at the law firm of Capell Barnett Matalon & Schoenfeld in Jericho, N.Y., wrote in an article for The CPA Journal.Even then, the loss is limited to the property’s original cost. Mr. Block gave this example: Say that someone paid $30,000 decades ago for a beachfront house that was worth $300,000 just before the storm. That taxpayer could claim only a loss of $30,000, plus the cost of any improvements, if the house was washed away.Different rules apply to business or investment property, Mr. Kess said. For one thing, there is no deduction of 10 percent of income. But any depreciation that has been claimed in previous years does enter into the calculation.While FEMA repair funds generally go only to primary residences, not vacation homes or rental property, such property is eligible for casualty losses, Mr. Block said. The test, he said, is this: “Are you the owner of the property?”The calculation of a casualty loss is made on Form 4684, and the amount is carried from that form to Schedule A of Form 1040, where itemized deductions are listed.For taxpayers who meet all the tests, the losses are not deducted from income dollar for dollar. Rather, their worth depends on the taxpayer’s bracket. The loss also reduces state and any city income taxes, Mr. Kess pointed out.Some taxpayers may not yet know if they have a deductible casualty loss, because they are awaiting the resolution of insurance claims. One way to deal with that is to request an automatic six-month extension of the April 15 tax filing date, Mr. Kess said.Another uncertainty is whether Congress will remove the requirement that a casualty loss be reduced by 10 percent of adjusted gross income, a step it took after Hurricane Katrina and some other devastating hurricanes. That uncertainty may be another reason to request an automatic extension.INSTEAD of deducting casualty losses on their 2012 returns, taxpayers can opt to use them to reduce 2011 income, by filing an amended return, Mr. Kess said. That might benefit someone whose income dropped drastically in the last two months of last year because of the storm, and to whom the deduction is thus more valuable against 2011 income, he said.Some people may have sustained such drastic losses that they wipe out an entire year’s income. In that situation, Mr. Block said, the losses can be carried back three years, by filing an amended return, to reduce previous years’ taxes and produce refunds for those years, or carried forward for up to 20 years, reducing taxable income in the future."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/yourtaxes/taxpayers-are-still-awaiting-a-simpler-system.html,"IF 2012 was the beginning of a long, inevitable slide toward tax increases, 2013 might just turn out to be the lurching start of tax reform.For more than a decade, lawmakers in both parties have lamented the complexity of the federal tax code, even as they layered on new deductions, credits and variable tax rates intended to reward some activities and punish others.The deal struck by the White House and Senate on New Year’s Day to head off the huge tax increases of the so-called fiscal cliff actually made matters worse on the complexity front. The highest marginal tax rate was increased to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for couples earning over $450,000 ($400,000 for individuals). In doing so, however, negotiators increased the total number of tax brackets to seven from six.Tax rates on capital gains and dividends for families earning less than that $450,000 threshold remain at 15 percent, but those who earn more will have some of their investments taxed at 20 percent. And personal exemption and tax deduction phase-outs, known as PEP and Pease, are coming back starting at incomes as low as $250,000. President George W. Bush banished those in 2001. (PEP stands for personal exemption phaseout, and Pease for former Representative Donald J. Pease, the Ohio Democrat who created the deduction cap.)The changes may sound like enough to make you ditch your tax-preparation software and run screaming as fast as you can to a professional accountant.But by the end of the year, efforts in both the House and Senate to overhaul the tax code, simplify it and strip out many bewildering and contradictory tax breaks might bear fruit. That’s because both political parties have an incentive, although not the same incentive, to move forward.“Tax reform is alive and well,” said Senator Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. “There’s such a need to simplify the code, to help the code be more competitive, to address a lot of inequities,” he said, adding that because the New Year’s tax deal did practically nothing to close loopholes and unclutter the tax code, “the road is clear.”Republicans are being driven by a long-held desire for simplification, pressed hard by the House Ways and Means Committee chairman, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan. Conservatives in the House have been clamoring to take on tax reform since they swept to power in 2010. And after a year of listening sessions, tutorials and hearings, Mr. Camp and the rest of the House Republican leadership want to move forward.For Democrats, it’s mainly about the money. The deal to avert the fiscal cliff contained tax rate increases, which President Obama has been demanding since his 2008 run for the White House. But the rate increases were not as inclusive as those he had campaigned for — he wanted tax rates to rise on incomes above $250,000, dividends to be taxed as ordinary income and inherited estates to face considerably higher rates and lower exemptions from taxation than the final deal demanded.On the estate tax, Mr. Obama wanted to subject the value of estates over $3.5 million to a 45 percent tax, higher than the 2012 level of 35 percent on estates over $5 million. The final deal did get a higher rate — 40 percent — but kept the exemption at $5 million, or $10 million for married couples, indexed for inflation. With that indexing, the exemption comes in at about $5.1 million for 2012 — double for a couple — a level that exempts all but a tiny number of inheritances. By raising taxes on incomes over $400,000, Congress also effectively raised only the top marginal income tax rate, not the top two, as the president and most Democrats had wanted. (It is the “marginal” rate because it applies only to income above a certain threshold.)Raising tax rates further won’t be simple, said Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, who as a leader of the Senate’s Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations has spent more than a decade examining tax shelters and dodges. The only way to raise more revenue for deficit reduction at this point, he said, lies with a tax code overhaul that curtails or eliminates breaks that favor the affluent and hits corporations that use offshore tax structures to shelter profits.Think mortgage interest deductions for second homes, the low “carried interest” tax rate paid by many private equity fund managers who take their fees in the form of capital gains skimmed off their clients’ earnings, or post office box subsidiaries in the Cayman Islands. There could even be some limit on deductions for charitable giving.“To me this is not about tax increases,” Mr. Levin said. “This is tax-avoidance termination, long overdue.”The maneuvering over these issues is well under way in Congress. Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said Senate Democrats hoped to pass a budget blueprint this spring that would include a parliamentary device called reconciliation to put tax reform on a fast track. Under reconciliation, a Congressional budget gives instructions to the tax-writing committees to draft legislation that saves (or costs) a specific amount of money over the window of the budget, usually 10 years.Reconciliation protects that legislation, drafted later in the year, from a filibuster in the Senate, meaning that it could pass with a simple, 51-vote majority. Mr. Bush passed his large 2001 and 2003 tax cuts under these terms. Now Democrats want to turn the tables and use the tactic to raise revenue. They have yet to say how much, but Mr. Obama’s last offer to Republicans for a deficit-reduction “grand bargain” asked for $1.2 trillion in new revenue over 10 years. The tax increases of the New Year’s deal raised about half that much, so another $600 billion in revenue through tax reform is a likely target.But Mr. Schumer’s suggestion has created its own problems. Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the finance committee, said the reconciliation device would poison any tax reform effort, leaving Republicans feeling strong-armed and voiceless.“I know Chuck wants to order the committee to do what he wants it to do,” Mr. Hatch said of the Schumer plan. “But that isn’t the way it’s going to work. In fact, that’s the way to create chaos.”The House budget, likely to be passed by April 15, will also include tax reform instructions. But the House’s version would raise no more revenue than the current tax code — albeit at the higher level of the post-fiscal-cliff tax regime.In normal times, Senate and House negotiators working out a final budget blueprint for both chambers might be counted on to split the difference, say, with a plan that raised $300 billion over 10 years. But these are not normal times, and Republicans in the House and Senate say that when it comes to taxes, they have given in enough.Moreover, the white-shoed tax lobbyists of K Street are already circling the Capitol, seeking to protect the tax breaks that their clients have paid them to protect. Before a formal push for tax reform even begins, a coalition of universities, philanthropies and others have all but made sure that no real harm will come to the deduction for charitable giving, for example. And electric power utilities have banded together to protect the low rate on dividends, saying that most dividends go to ordinary retirees, not the superrich.To those who remember the struggle with lobbyists over the 1986 tax-code overhaul, 2013 is developing into “Showdown at Gucci Gulch II.” Then again, no one gave the 1986 tax reform effort much chance at success — yet it was enacted.“There are a lot of crosscurrents here: the need for revenues, spending cuts,” Mr. Baucus said of the task at hand. “There’s just a lot going on.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/yourtaxes/same-sex-couples-may-find-tax-time-doubly-trying.html,"FOR Colette Hayward and Margaret Selby, the problem is this: Maryland recognizes their 2009 marriage, but the federal government does not.The ramifications are maddeningly complex, no more so than when they deal with the Internal Revenue Service. Two years after taking legal action to assert their rights as a married couple, they are paying a price when they pay their taxes.For Ms. Hayward, 47, a lawyer who owns two construction businesses, and Ms. Selby, 48, a Baltimore County police officer, a big issue involves insurance benefits they fought to achieve. They are paying taxes on those benefits, even though such benefits for spouses normally are not taxed.For same-sex couples across the United States, an offshoot of being married is a dizzying set of complications in computing taxes. Although nine states and the District of Columbia have approved same-sex marriages — two others recognize marriages conducted elsewhere — the federal 1996 Defense of Marriage Act prohibits such unions from being recognized by the federal government.Ms. Hayward, 47, and Ms. Selby, 48, have two children and three grandchildren. They were together for 18 years before they married in Massachusetts. Soon after their marriage in 2009, Ms. Selby filed a request with the Baltimore County Police Department to add Ms. Hayward to her health care coverage and to make sure she was eligible for other benefits available to officer’s spouses. She was turned down.Lambda Legal, the gay, bisexual and transgender advocacy organization, filed an administrative grievance, arguing that denying benefits to a married couple, gay or straight, was contrary to Maryland law. It cited a 2010 opinion by the Maryland attorney general, Douglas F. Gansler, which noted the state’s longstanding law recognizing out-of-state marriages, including same-sex ones.In 2011, an arbitrator ruled in the couple’s favor. But the victory came with a catch. Generally, health insurance benefits are not taxable, and adding a spouse or child to an insurance policy has no tax consequences. But because of DOMA, their insurance is treated not as a spousal benefit, but as imputed income, and thus subject to federal income tax. Ms. Hayward said Baltimore County told the couple that adding her to the policy increased the cost of the insurance by about $8,000 a year. She figures that it will increase their overall tax bill by about $2,500 to $3,000.“We never expected this,” Ms. Hayward said. “We didn’t sit there studying the I.R.S. code thinking we might be facing a major tax hit.”Tax issues for same-sex married couples are numerous and often require expert advice to navigate.Because same-sex couples are not permitted to file federal returns jointly, they cannot combine incomes and deductions to take advantage of lower tax rates and the benefits that can accrue, say, from balancing profits and losses in financial transactions.Issues also arise when same-sex couples have children or other dependents, because they cannot file joint tax returns and may not both be legal parents. That complicates exemption claims and child care benefits, including education tax breaks.PERHAPS most significantly for couples with major assets, DOMA prevents same-sex couples from taking advantage of estate tax exemptions, about $5.1 million for 2012 — but double that for couples — after indexing for inflation. If one member of a same-sex couple dies and leaves a spouse $5 million, those assets would be taxed. For heterosexual couples, there would be no tax.That tax disparity is at the heart of the first challenge to DOMA to reach the United States Supreme Court. It was filed by Edith Windsor, who married Thea Spyer in 2007. When Ms. Spyer died in 2009, she left Ms. Windsor her share of their cottage in Southampton, N.Y., valued at $550,000 and an apartment on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan valued at $1.3 million. The result was a $600,000 federal and state estate tax bill.“I was indignant and hurt,” Ms. Windsor said. “If her name had been Theo instead of Thea I would have owed no taxes.”The extra costs extend even to the tax-filing process. For same-sex couples in states that recognize their marriages, couples must prepare two sets of federal returns — one that they will actually file, and another prepared as if they were married, to help prepare their state tax return.Not having a marriage recognized for tax purposes can actually be an advantage, and the repeal of DOMA could cost some same-sex married couples some money. Just as many married couples are hit with the so-called marriage tax, many same-sex couples save money by being forced to file separately.“I think a lot of same-sex married couples in high income ranges have no idea that once their marriage is recognized they will be paying a lot more in federal income tax because of the marriage tax penalty,” said Patricia Cain, a tax law professor at Santa Clara University, who is herself in a same-sex marriage. “I just ran the figures on a couple in the $2 million range, and in 2013 they’ll be paying $35,000 more in federal tax filing jointly.”Still, she said, both for social-equity reasons and because of the contradictions, ambiguities and holes in the current tax system, the repeal of DOMA cannot happen too soon. The confusion applies not just to marriage but to its dissolution as well, she said.“We need to have marriage recognized, so we can know how to do divorce,” she said.She said that she was confident DOMA would eventually fall, but that there was no way to predict what the Windsor case would bring or whether the Supreme Court would make a broad ruling on DOMA or a narrow one — say, on how it would affect the estate tax for same-sex couples.Back in Maryland, Ms. Hayward said she and Ms. Selby had considered dropping the insurance but had decided against it.“It’s going to cost us more, but we fought so hard for it, we figure we should stick it out,” she said. “We’re hoping there’s going to be some movement on DOMA that will make this a nonissue. I’m very optimistic. I may be naïve, but I’m very optimistic.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/yourtaxes/for-small-businesses-tax-law-has-become-a-moving-target.html,"TAX planning can be difficult for a small business, all the more so when a lot of the work is left until the last minute — not by the owners or their accountants, but by Congress.Businesses will have to make sense of a number of tax changes approved on New Year’s Day, along with some tax increases and other requirements approved earlier, notably in connection with health care programs.The legislation, which averted the so-called fiscal cliff, set higher rates on several taxes that affect small-business owners, while giving new life to credits and deductions that they find particularly helpful. And if they still have to pay more to the Internal Revenue Service, it may not be their only extra expense, tax specialists warn. The cost — in time, money and worry — of preparing returns, tweaking payroll systems and complying with regulations will rise, too, they say.“There were some big changes as we moved into the new year,” said Kate Barton, the Americas vice chairwoman for tax services at Ernst & Young. “We moved from the fiscal cliff to a fiscal minefield.”Small-business owners may already be placing themselves on the casualty list. Eighty percent of the ones responding to a Gallup poll last month said that the tax situation was hurting them a little or a lot, versus 2 percent who said it was helping. In the health care realm, the spread of opinion was similar, at 73 percent to 2 percent.Business owners had to start docking their employees’ pay, and their own, by an extra two percentage points on Jan. 1, when a two-year reduction in the payroll tax expired. They might also have had to increase withholding or estimated-tax payments to adjust for higher income and Medicare tax rates that went into effect that day for high earners.Tax rates on dividends also increased for those with high incomes. That could affect owners of businesses set up as C corporations, who often extract money from their companies as dividends instead of salary, Ms. Barton said.The higher rate on dividends could make a C corporation less tax efficient than a sole proprietorship or an entity like a partnership or a subchapter S corporation, in which income ultimately accrues to the owners as individuals. She noted, though, that this is just one of several considerations when deciding which structure is best.“It might be better to have a lower corporate rate than a higher individual rate,” but with the changes made on Jan. 1, “the difference in rates could be only four percentage points,” she said. “You really need to think it through because there’s more flexibility with a partnership or some other flow-through entity. You’ve got to run the numbers to see what’s best.”Several deductions and credits coveted by small businesses have been renewed, expanded or reinstated retroactively, said Carl J. Giardino, managing director of the tax group at the CBIZ MHM consulting firm. The amount of the Section 179 deduction, which allows expenditures on capital items like factory equipment to be written off immediately rather than depreciated gradually, has been raised to $500,000 from $125,000. The increase applies to 2012 and 2013 alike.Bonus depreciation, which allows capital equipment to be written off at a faster rate beyond what the Section 179 deduction allows, has been extended and applies to the first $2 million spent, he said. Unlike the situation with the deduction, only new equipment — not used — qualifies for accelerated depreciation.Two credits that expired in 2011 or were sharply curtailed, the Research Tax Credit and the Work Opportunities Tax Credit, have been brought back and made retroactive to 2012, Mr. Giardino said. The first credit is for 20 percent of research expenditure that exceeds a baseline amount or 14 percent using a different formulation. The second is for 40 percent of varying portions of wages for new employees in certain fields.The Work Opportunities credit, which covers military veterans, workers coming off government assistance, and ex-felons, is useful for “almost any type of Main Street business,” he said. “If I hire 10 people and can put $25,000 to $40,000 back in my pocket, that’s significant” to a small business. “A lot of companies in the restaurant field were taking advantage of this. It really helped them stay afloat.”That was until the credit was eliminated for all categories of workers except veterans last year, before the reinstatement. While he acknowledges the value of this and other credits to small businesses, Mr. Giardino finds the on-again, off-again situation unhelpful.“We keep doing Band-Aids, extending credits a year or two,” he said. “We need some permanency with these provisions for them to become meaningful so that businesses can plan accordingly.”Some intense planning could be in order as the Jan. 1, 2014, deadline approaches for important requirements of the Affordable Care Act. It could cost employers dearly if they fail to meet certain conditions, warned J. D. Piro,  head of the legal group of the health and benefits practice at the Aon Hewitt consulting firm.A business with 50 or more employees who each work at least 30 hours a week must offer them health insurance that meets certain criteria. If it does not and if any employees get subsidized coverage at a government insurance exchange, Mr. Piro said, the business is subject to hefty fines. The calculation is tedious, but it works out to a fine of $2,000, times the size of the total work force — not just the employees who obtain an exchange subsidy — minus $60,000.Businesses also face a penalty when the premium for the employer’s plan exceeds 9.5 percent of an employee’s wages and the employee decides to take an exchange subsidy. This penalty is $3,000, but is assessed based on the number of employees who get the subsidy, not the entire staff.Even if companies manage to escape the penalties, Mr. Piro said, headaches may be unavoidable.“Small businesses are going to have to conduct tests to make sure their coverage is affordable and to make sure they’ve offered it to full-time employees,” he said. “There’s a lot of work involved to make sure they meet these rules.”Ms. Barton at Ernst & Young agreed. “A lot of companies of all sizes are grappling with it and are very ill prepared,” she said. “I’m really worried about small companies. They should do a feasibility analysis to see if their existing benefit plan is adequate and their employees are educated.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/jobs/strassburgers-chief-on-a-5-generation-family-business.html,"MY family has been in the meat business for five generations, starting in the 1860s. My grandfather’s family business specialized in beef. And my grandmother’s family specialty was veal. Both families were in the Bronx.After she married my grandfather in 1932, my grandmother was a guiding force in the business, which supplies wholesale meat to grocery chains and dry-aged, prime steaks to major New York steakhouses, restaurants and chefs. I have two sisters, one older and one younger, and my parents raised us in Chappaqua, N.Y.I have known since I was a little girl that I wanted to be in the meat business. My father would take me along when he went to the company’s meatpacking plant, which was then on West 133rd Street in Harlem.I was so captivated by the idea of the meat business that when it was show-and-tell time at school, my idea was to take cuts of beef as well as eyeballs and cow brains to show my classmates. Later in life, I became known as Suzy Sirloin.It was cold in the meat locker, so I always dressed in a coat. I also wore a turtleneck, a hat and gloves — as if going skiing. I began by answering phones and checking bills. It was always fun to accompany my father when he visited buyers like steakhouses or grocery stores.But my father also encouraged us to have broader horizons. I attended college at Catholic University in Washington and earned my degree in sociology in 1989. I played a lot of volleyball, and in my senior year I began working at a gourmet market on Capitol Hill. I liked it so much that I continued working there after receiving my degree.In 1991, I decided to move back to New York and go into the meat business. My first job was putting together boxes. Then I was promoted to packing meat in boxes, which were then loaded into tractor-trailers.One day, while helping pack meat in a box, I noticed that the delivery was running late, so I asked my co-workers to toss the meat to me faster. They threw a 30-pound roast so fast that I fell in the fat and blood. After that, I asked my dad if I could just stick to answering the phones, and he agreed.My father trained me in how to buy and sell meat, and I had to learn to be a dogged negotiator in an industry that was dominated by men. One sister decided not to join the business, and my other sister is our bill collector — that’s also a tough job.One thing I enjoy is the chance to visit some of our suppliers, who are located in Iowa, Colorado and Nebraska — something I like so much that I wear a cowboy hat as a tribute to the hard-working ranchers and farmers.Last year, we started to sell to customers of Williams-Sonoma the type of prime, dry-aged steaks we sell to steakhouses. People can order our steaks and other meats from the online store and have them delivered to the door.People are still eating our beef, often as a celebration meal. So to make it more accessible for everyday meals, I expanded our offerings in the New York metropolitan area last year to include natural beef, lamb, pork and veal under a new independent label called Suzy Sirloin. The meat, which has no hormones or antibiotics, comes in one-pound packages to make it easier for home cooks.To keep up with industry news, and to offer recipes, health and safety tips, I started a Web site called the Sirloin Report. When I travel, I often promote American beef and its nutritional value. I earned a special kind of M.B.A. — a Master’s in Beef Advocacy from the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association — to help me be a better ambassador."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/credit-rating-club-is-tough-to-get-into.html,"BETTER late than never.That was probably a common response to the news last week that the Justice Department had filed a civil suit against Standard & Poor’s, one of the two big credit ratings agencies that were so central to the mortgage boom and bust. The department said that S.& P. misled investors by presenting its ratings as the product of objective analyses when, the suit says, they were more about generating revenue to the firm. S.& P. denied the allegations, saying it was prepared to go to trial. Many people have been disappointed that S.& P. and Moody’s Investors Service, the big and powerful companies that are supposed to assess the creditworthiness of bonds, have escaped culpability. Not only do these companies still hold sway in securities markets, they’ve also hung on to their lush profits from the glory days of mortgage origination. During 2005 and 2006, for example, Moody’s made $238 million by rating complex mortgage instruments. Investors who trusted those ratings lost billions.Given that the financial crisis began unfolding more than five years ago, it is discouraging to see how entrenched the large and established ratings companies remain. Ratings are still used to determine bank capital requirements, and investors rely heavily on them.Over the years, lawmakers have tried to open up the duopolistic world of ratings agencies to greater competition and, therefore, better performance. Legislation in 2006 encouraged the Securities and Exchange Commission to let new companies into the ratings club. The commission set up the Office of Credit Ratings to register new entrants and to monitor all participants’ activities. Today, 10 credit ratings agencies are recognized by the S.E.C.But gaining regulatory approval to join the ratings arena is exceedingly burdensome. That, at least, has been the experience of R&R Consulting, a firm with a stable of highly respected credit analysts and an enviable record of having predicted the mortgage mess in 2003.R&R has been trying to get recognition as a credit rating agency since 2011. Frustrated by what it perceives as roadblocks erected by the S.E.C., its executives are beginning to wonder if the commission really wants increased competition.The firm was founded in 2000 by Ann Rutledge and Sylvain Raynes, experts in structured finance who previously worked at Moody’s. It is a small shop, with seven employees, but its clients include investors, small and medium-size banks, financial regulators and other institutions. R&R’s specialty is risk measurement for all asset types.R&R’s approach differs from traditional ratings agencies because, in addition to being able to rate new issues, it analyzes risks in securities that are trading in the secondary, or resale, market, after they are issued. By contrast, S.& P. and Moody’s became known for giving mortgage securities high ratings and downgrading them only when defaults were soaring.  “In the primary market, everyone prices a security around the credit rating,” Ms. Rutledge says. “In the secondary market, no one cares about the credit rating; what they want is valuation. We connect primary-market ratings with secondary-market valuations.”THE R&R distinction between a rating and a valuation, however, seems to pose a problem when it comes to getting S.E.C. approval as a ratings agency, Ms. Rutledge says.By law, many requirements must be met before a firm can become a ratings agency. Chief among them is that the applicant must provide letters from 10 “qualified institutional buyers” that have used the company’s ratings over the previous three years.R&R has had difficulties with its letters. One was rejected because its writer identified the firm’s work as ratings or valuations, not simply as ratings, Ms. Rutledge says. Another letter failed to pass muster because it was from a German institution that characterized itself as the equivalent of a qualified institutional buyer. When a foreign institution could not get its letter notarized as required — notaries are not as common overseas — it was not good enough for the S.E.C.And not all clients want to write such a letter for use by the S.E.C. Instead, some said they would discuss the company’s work by telephone. The S.E.C. rejected the idea.“It’s extremely difficult for us to satisfy the ‘10 qualified institutional buyers’ requirement,” Ms. Rutledge says. “Proof that you’ve done business with them is not enough; it says you must have letters. And they have a suggested text for the letter. When we changed the text slightly they said it was not in conformity.”John Nester, a spokesman for the S.E.C., said the agency was simply following the requirements of the law. “Congress specifically drafted a statute that took away the potential for subjective staff analysis and replaced it with an objective, bright-line test for obtaining the designation,” he said.Moreover, he added, the commission has not rejected R&R’s application. “The easy thing to do would be to deny an application because it did not meet the specific statutory requirement,” he said. “It is far better public policy to do what we do to take the extra time and make the extra effort to try to find a way to say yes.”But to Ms. Rutledge, the S.E.C.’s response to R&R’s application seems like either a case of bureaucracy run amok or evidence of a mind-set among the commission’s staff that supports the status quo. Two of the three S.E.C. staff members considering R&R’s application used to work at S.& P. One of them, Diane Audino, a securities compliance examiner, left S.& P. in 2009, after 25 years. Her colleague Scott Davey worked in S.& P.’s mortgage securities unit during the mania.Mr. Nester, commenting on behalf of Ms. Audino and Mr. Davey, said that they are just two members of a team that vets applications and that they would make no policy decisions in the R&R case.But Ms. Rutledge said she has found the process exasperating. “The message from the S.E.C. was ‘you know we can’t accept any riffraff from off the street,’ ” she said.     Yet how about this for qualifications: Mr. Raynes earned a Ph.D. in aeronautical engineering from Princeton and has a master’s degree in numerical analysis from the von Karman Institute in Belgium.Ms. Rutledge, a Wellesley graduate, has an M.B.A. from the University of Chicago. Both are professors of structured finance, she in Hong Kong and he in New York; they have written a textbook entitled “Elements of Structured Finance.” Financial regulators in Hong Kong hired Ms. Rutledge to write the licensing manual and examination for ratings agency analysts. R&R has also done extensive expert-witness work on behalf of investors who were hurt in the mortgage mess. “We understand the cultural reasons why what we’re doing might seem strange,” Ms. Rutledge said. “We’re used to being unrecognized. But does this help investors?”In a word, no."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/yourtaxes/tax-law-changes-make-it-even-wiser-to-plan-ahead.html,"IF you’ve gathered up the documents and compiled the data for your 2012 tax return, congratulations. The next part, of course, may be painful: actually calculating your taxes.But you may feel better if you can figure out how to improve your tax situation for the next filing season. By taking into account changes in the tax law, some planning is possible.Even if you rely on tax software or a professional preparer, it always helps to know what questions to ask. Here are some issues to consider:MEDICARE SURCHARGES To hear the politicians in Washington tell it, you might think that taxes will rise this year only for individuals with incomes above $400,000 and married couples filing jointly with incomes above $450,000. But that is not the whole story. Millions of Americans with lower incomes will face higher taxes because of new Medicare surcharges.John J. Connors of Milwaukee, a lawyer and accountant who formerly taught tax law at the University of Notre Dame and the University of Wisconsin, notes that a surcharge of nine-tenths of 1 percent will be levied on earnings above $200,000 for single filers and on earnings above $250,000 for joint filers. Separately, a surcharge of 3.8 percent will apply to net investment income for people whose adjusted gross incomes top the $200,000 and $250,000 thresholds.While investment income has traditionally meant capital gains, interest and dividends, it is very broadly defined for the Medicare surcharges , Mr. Connors said, including rental income, as well as profits from passive investments, in which a person puts money into a business but is not active in it.Small-business owners could be affected, he says, because more than 90 percent of businesses file tax returns as S corporations or partnerships in which profits flow through to the owners and are taxed at the individual level. Mr. Connors said there was a loophole for S corporation owners who minimized their salaries and instead paid out business profits as distributions, which are not subject to the surtax.Trusts will be especially hard hit, he said. Those with investment income above $11,950 will owe $3,090 in income tax, plus 39.6 percent of the amount above $11,950, as well as the 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on investment income. People with trusts might consider paying out as much of the trust income as possible because it would be subject to the surtax only if a beneficiary’s income exceeded the $200,000 or $250,000 threshold.ESTIMATED TAXES Most business owners and self-employed people must pay estimated taxes for the first quarter of this year by April 15. Barbara Weltman, a tax lawyer in Millwood, N.Y., says filers should consider whether they will owe the new surcharges when calculating their estimates. Retirees who rely on investment or real estate income may also be liable for estimated taxes and may be required to pay the Medicare surcharge even if they themselves are covered by Medicare, said Ms. Weltman, who is also a contributing editor to “J.K. Lasser’s Your Income Tax 2013.”MEDICAL EXPENSES Julian Block, a tax lawyer in Larchmont, N.Y., suggests several planning points for families with big medical expenses, which have been deductible only to the extent that unreimbursed costs exceed 7.5 percent of adjusted gross income. For most taxpayers, that floor will rise this year to 10 percent, though for people 65 and over, that change will be delayed until after 2016.Couples should calculate taxes both as married filing separately and as married filing jointly, he says. If one spouse has a lower income than the other but high medical expenses, the net result of filing separately  may be lower overall taxes, he adds, “but it is not axiomatic.”Remember to include medical-related transportation costs, he says. If you drive your own car, mileage for 2012 is deductible at 23 cents a mile, rising to 24 cents this year (unlike driving for charity, deductible at 14 cents a mile for 2012 and 2013, or for business, at 55 cents a mile, rising to 56.5 cents this year). Parking and tolls may also be included.He said people who help support elderly parents could include the parents’ costs in calculating a medical expense deduction, provided that they pay the medical bills directly rather than giving money to the parents so they can pay them. This applies even if the taxpayers are not entitled to a dependency exemption.FAMILY FINANCES Sidney Kess, a tax lawyer and certified public accountant who is of counsel to the firm Kostelanetz & Fink, cites other aspects of family finances to consider. For example, if a widow or a widower is supporting adult children, he or she may be able to list them as dependents and file as head of household, rather than single.Another consideration involves long-term capital gains and dividends. That income is tax-free for people in the 10 percent and 15 percent tax brackets, meaning taxable income no higher than $35,350 for a single filer in 2013 or $70,700 for a couple filing jointly. In some instances, Mr. Kess said, it may be advantageous for affluent people to give investment assets to a low-income relatives. Provided that the low-income relatives aren’t subject to what is known as the kiddie tax, they would owe no taxes on the income.This would also reduce the affluent person’s income, and that reduction could have significant benefits. That’s because taxpayers in the new top bracket of 39.6 percent will be taxed at 20 percent on such income, five percentage points higher than for those in the 25 through 35 percent brackets. In addition, single filers with adjusted gross incomes above $250,000 ($300,000 for married couples) face phase-outs of itemized deductions and personal exemptions this year.HOME OFFICE DEDUCTION This tax break is for self-employed people who work from home, regardless of whether that is full-time or sideline work, and for employees whose employers require them to maintain a home office. It has been known as an audit trap, in part because complicated rules have resulted in filing errors.For 2013 there is a new option, said Julie A. Welch, of Kansas City, Mo., a certified public accountant and certified financial planner at Meara Welch Browne P.C.“To reduce paperwork burdens, the I.R.S. will allow qualified taxpayers to deduct $5 per square foot for home office expenses,” up to a maximum of $1,500, she said. “In addition, you will be able to deduct 100 percent of the interest on your mortgage and 100 percent of the real estate taxes as itemized deductions on Schedule A.” The traditional home office deduction required apportioning those costs between the home office on Form 8829 and Schedule A.Two traditional requirements, however, still apply: the home office must be used regularly and exclusively for business and must be necessary for the conduct of the business.SOCIAL SECURITY TAX Withholding for Social Security has gone back to 6.2 percent this year, and on earnings up to $113,700. The tax had been shaved by two percentage points the past two years to stimulate the economy. The change could amount to an annual increase of $2,274 for a single person or up to $4,548 for a couple, Mr. Connors said.He also cited these parts of the new law:• For taxpayers taking the standard deduction, rather than itemizing deductions, the marriage penalty has been eliminated. The standard deduction for married filers is twice that of single filers, $12,200 versus $6,100.• The mass transit benefit break, which had been cut to $125 a month after 2011, has been reinstated and extended. Employees can exclude up to $245 a month from gross income for employer-provided mass transit as well as for parking benefits this year. For 2012, $240 was retroactively set as the upper monthly limit for both of those benefits.• The option for taxpayers who itemize federal deductions to deduct state and local sales taxes rather than state income taxes has been reinstated for this year and made retroactive for 2012. The option may benefit people who live in states without a state income tax, like Texas or South Dakota, or who buy a big-ticket item like a car or yacht.• The option for taxpayers aged 70 1/2 or older to make tax-free transfers of up to $100,000 from an I.R.A. to a charity has been reinstated for last year and extended for this year. By having the money transferred directly, taxpayers may satisfy the legal requirement for minimum distributions after age 70 1/2 without increasing adjusted gross income and hence taxes.Mr. Connors said the law provided an exception to the direct transfer rule for people who took the required distributions in December or January and would now like to have the money go to charity."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/business/yourtaxes/reviewing-three-brands-of-tax-preparation-software.html,"TAX preparation is moving to the cloud.The makers of the better-known tax prep programs — TurboTax, H&R Block at Home and TaxAct — say that many customers, particularly younger ones, prefer Web-based programs to old-fashioned, desktop versions. Web-based programs — techies call this cloud computing — reside on remote servers that customers access via their browsers. They offer the convenience of working on a return from any Internet-connected computer and having that return stored on the software makers’ secure servers.After spending several days running my family’s tax information through Web and desktop offerings, I learned that I’m old-school. For a decade, I’ve completed our return on my Mac desktop, and I prefer that. Desktop programs may be costlier and, in some ways, clunkier — you must buy them on CD or download them — but they also offer more flexibility.A single purchase, for example, lets you prepare and file multiple returns, as you might want to do if you’re part of a same-sex couple or if you help family members or friends with their taxes. And you can more easily jump back and forth between the tax return and the interviews the programs use to gather information. That lets you check entries as you make them, as my wife, a C.P.A., insists upon. What you lose in convenience, you gain in control.Each of the tax preparation programs, whether desktop or online, has strengths and shortcomings. TurboTax is the easiest to use, importing lots of financial information with just a few clicks. H&R Block promises the most reassuring help — its staff will represent you at no extra charge if you’re audited. TaxAct offers the best price. A look at each provider’s offerings shows where it excelled and stumbled in preparing my family’s 2012 return. TurboTaxTurboTax’s maker, Intuit, has its roots in technology, not taxes, and its facility with bits and bytes shows in its wares. Its desktop and online programs make doing taxes as simple as such a time-eating task can be. If you end up cursing come tax time, the target will be the I.R.S., not your software.I downloaded the desktop version of TurboTax Premier for $89.99 — though I learned later that I could have paid $10 less if I’d bought it on CD at my local Staples. The download took only a few seconds, as did the import of information from our 2011 return. All of the unchanged data from 2011 — names, addresses, federal ID numbers, even descriptions of business expenses — popped into the right places on the 2012 forms. Even the names of the charities we support carried over. The software also imported my wife’s W-2 and all of the information on our investments from Vanguard, T. Rowe Price and Fidelity. All I had to do was key in details for a few local banks and update the amounts we’d given to charity.The online version of TurboTax, by contrast, didn’t import as much. My attempt to transfer our 2011 return failed, and an import from one of the fund companies went awry. I inherited an I.R.A., and the money is invested in about a half-dozen funds. Instead of creating an entry for a single 1099-R, the program created a half-dozen, which I had to combine.Otherwise, the online program looked and worked much the same way as the desktop software. I didn’t have to pay to try it because TurboTax, like H&R Block and TaxAct, doesn’t require online users to pay until they file their returns. Had I filed with the online version of TurboTax Premier, I would have paid $49.99 for a single federal return — the price as it was discounted at the time. But TurboTax says it could rise to as much as $74.99, its list price, before April 15. TurboTax upgraded its assistance features for this year’s tax filing season — a welcome improvement. In the past, I’d found some help links hard to locate and navigate. When I wanted to pose a question to a tax expert, I had to dig around. But not anymore. When I had a question about recording tax-exempt interest, I clicked on the help link, and TurboTax offered a choice between a call and an online chat. Within seconds, I was e-chatting with Marilyn G., and she pointed me to the right spot on the return. We were done in less than five minutes, and I paid nothing extra. I’ve had a tougher time buying jeans online. (All three companies also provide extensive tax-law explanations embedded in their programs.)Where TurboTax irks is with its pitching of additional products and services. The online program asked if I wanted to set up an I.R.A. via Mint.com, an Intuit personal finance Web site. It encouraged me to contribute to a charity, Operation Homefront, that TurboTax supports. Both the online and desktop programs tried to sell me, for $39.95, the audit defense services of a company called TaxResources. And they both urged me to pay $10 to upgrade to TurboTax Home & Business.Yes, businesses have to market themselves and grow, but this kind of promotion grates when you’re pondering the big bill you owe the I.R.S. H&R Block at HomeIn past years, I’ve liked H&R Block’s desktop software. It didn’t import quite as much information as TurboTax did, and occasionally didn’t provide some obscure piece of tax guidance that I could find in TurboTax. But I enjoyed its eye-pleasing, easy-to-use interface and concluded that, for most people, it could do a fine job. This year, I had problems installing it.I tried to download the desktop version from Block’s Web site and failed — four times. I kept trying to remove any obstacles at my end. I quit my browser, Safari, and restarted. I turned off my pop-up blocker and my antivirus software. I rebooted my Mac. Nothing helped. Stymied, I trundled over to Staples, where I bought Block’s Premium software on CD for $59.99. After that 30-minute detour, I popped in the CD and set about installing the software and the latest updates. During the update installation, the program quit. I restarted. Finally, it worked.Were the glitches my fault? Maybe. I’m no techie; my nephew who is about to turn 11 can do more with my iPhone than I can. But I was working with the same Mac and antivirus program as last year, and if any software should be idiot-proof, it’s a tax preparation program. Lots of nontechies use software to do their taxes.After installation, Block’s desktop program was fine. As in years past, it didn’t import as much information as TurboTax, but it otherwise handled our return without problems. And I love the lime green of its interface, which calls to mind Kermit the Frog.Block’s online offering operated just as smoothly. And because it didn’t have to be installed, it spared me a spike in blood pressure. Had I used it to file, I would have paid $49.95 for a federal return.Block’s assistance also impresses. If you use its software to file your return, the company promises that one of its tax experts will represent you, free, if you’re audited. The chances of needing this help are slim — the I.R.S. audits less than 1 percent of individual returns, according to statistics it publishes. But even the idea of an audit brings angst, and that guarantee reassures. TaxActTaxAct’s selling point is price. The desktop version of its Ultimate Bundle, which includes electronic filing of a federal and a state return, costs $21.95. TaxAct doesn’t sell a desktop version for the Mac, so in years past I had to load the software onto my wife’s PC and work on our return there. This year, I opted to try the online offering instead. I plowed through our return without difficulty, though I did have to type in more of our information because TaxAct imported less than TurboTax and Block did.In addition to being inexpensive, TaxAct is quirky. Its maker, 2nd Story Software in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, does some things differently than its competitors. Its interview questions come in a different order, and some of them address surprising topics.Only TaxAct, for example, asked me whether I had a conscientious objection to Social Security and had filed Form 4029 documenting it. Members of some religious denominations can be exempt from Social Security taxes, as long as they promise not to take benefits.I didn’t need to know this, but it was a fascinating tidbit to learn — and I’m a fan of anything that relieves tedium at tax time."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/opinion/a-tax-to-pay-for-war.html,"WASHINGTONNOW that Congress has discarded the idea that taxes can never be raised, we must change how we pay for the wars we ask our military to fight. We should institute a war tax.With leading officials calling for action in Syria, and the American military providing support for France’s intervention in Mali, the need for such a tax is urgent. And President Obama’s call for tax reform as the next round of budget negotiations begins offers a perfect opportunity to enact it.Military spending has been declining since 2009, easing the conflict between pursuing our national security interests and solving our fiscal crisis. But if we undertake new military interventions, that tension will come roaring back.Those who look at our military spending as a percent of gross domestic product and argue that we could spend more are right. At our current level of $646 billion, we are spending roughly 4 percent of G.D.P. on national defense, well below cold war averages. The missing part of their argument is whether we can afford to pay for it now or would have to borrow, adding to the national debt. After all, war spending — like all government spending — wrecks public finances only when more money is spent than is brought in.This simple equation is nothing new. Three years ago, the Senate Budget Committee adopted a bipartisan amendment requiring that wars be paid for. The Simpson-Bowles deficit-reduction commission and Senator Al Franken, Democrat of Minnesota, both proposed doing much the same thing. None of these proposals resolved the question of whether to pay for future wars through spending cuts or raising more revenue. Now that Congress has finally passed legislation letting taxes increase, we must make a choice and require a tax surcharge to pay for any military operation.War traditionally has motivated major changes in tax policy. The Civil War brought the first income tax. World War I made the federal income tax permanent. World War II brought tax withholding. In 1969, at the height of the Vietnam War, the United States ran a budget surplus because of a tax surcharge Congress forced President Lyndon B. Johnson to accept.Today’s budget negotiations offer a similar opportunity to make a surcharge permanent. President Obama called for counting as savings the money that will not be spent as the war in Afghanistan winds down. Many decried the scheme as playing with funny money because he plans to exit Afghanistan in 2014 anyway; the savings only exist because of an accounting trick in Congressional budgeting. But if those savings were associated with an actual policy change, they would start looking more real.Since the Budget Control Act already caps military spending, there is an easy way to implement the surcharge: any spending over the caps would require it. If we felt the need to use the military and could do so under the spending caps, as the Obama administration did in 2011 responding to the earthquake in Japan and the uprising in Libya, no surcharge would be necessary. But if military action required supplemental financing, any amount over the caps would be offset with new revenue raised by an automatic surcharge on taxes.By tying military action to additional revenue, the president would actually have a freer hand in deciding when to use force. Every argument the Obama administration makes for military action would explicitly include a call for increased taxes, forcing the question of whether the stakes in the military situation are worth the cost. If the American people agree they are worth it, the president will get both the political support and financing he needs.Syria is the most immediate example. We now know that some top officials have argued for arming the rebels, as the secretaries of state and defense and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff did last year. Others argue for an even more robust military response, while detractors insist that we should learn from Iraq and not get involved at all.Such decisions should not be divorced from economic considerations, but neither should we allow our finances to prevent us from pursuing vital American security interests. Putting in place a permanent tax surcharge to pay for wars would ensure that we could achieve our interests throughout the world without further worsening our finances.If military action is worth our troops’ blood, it should be worth our treasure, too — not just in the abstract, but in the form of a specific ante by every American."

On June 27, 2007, Timothy F. Geithner, the committee’s vice chairman, summed up the economic situation by observing: “The United States looks O.K., and the world looks very strong. Housing here seems as though it will get worse before it gets better, but the rest of the economy seems to be doing reasonably well.”Mr. Geithner’s views echoed those of, among others, Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr., who observed on April 20, 2007: “I don’t see [subprime mortgage troubles] imposing a serious problem. I think it’s going to be largely contained.”For the Justice Department, in the name of the United States, to sue S.&P. for ratings in 2007 that failed to correctly predict a collapse of the housing market to near-depression levels is simply unsustainable.FLOYD ABRAMSNew York, Feb. 6, 2013The writer is counsel to Standard & Poor’s in the Justice Department litigation."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/business/economy/us-retail-sales-show-slight-rise-in-january.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Retail sales barely rose in January as tax increases and higher gasoline prices restrained spending, setting up the economy for only modest growth in the first quarter.The Commerce Department said on Wednesday that retail sales edged up 0.1 percent after a 0.5 percent rise in December.The small increase suggested that the expiration of a two-percentage-point payroll tax cut on Jan. 1 and higher tax rates for wealthier Americans were weighing on the economy.Still, economists said consumer spending was unlikely to buckle given rising home values, moderate job growth and rallying stock market prices.“We are starting to see the impact of higher taxes, but we have a positive wealth effect from increasing house prices and a boost from equities,” said Robert Dye, chief economist at Comerica Bank. “My expectation is that consumers are able to continue to increase spending, but only moderately.”Core sales, which exclude automobiles, gasoline and building materials and correspond most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, ticked up 0.1 percent.Consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of the American economy, grew at a 2.2 percent annual rate in the fourth quarter. That helped to soften the blow to the economy from slower inventory accumulation and sharp cuts in military spending.The government said last month that economic output slipped at a 0.1 percent rate in the final three months of 2012.However, the retail sales report showed core sales were a bit stronger in November and December than previously reported. In addition, businesses, excluding auto dealerships, accumulated slightly more inventory in December than earlier thought.Taken together with a smaller trade deficit in December, the data suggested the government would raise its estimate for fourth-quarter gross domestic product when it publishes a revision later this month. Even so, the economy most likely grew at a rate under 1 percent in the fourth quarter, economists said.Growth in consumer spending is expected to retreat from the pace of the fourth quarter as households adjust to smaller paychecks and higher gasoline prices. Prices at the pump have increased 30 cents so far this year.Estimates of consumer spending growth in the first quarter currently range from 0.7 percent to 1.8 percent.Some economists were encouraged that consumers had maintained purchases, though at a slow pace, despite a reduction in their disposable incomes.“By no means are we completely out of the woods when it comes to the impact of higher taxes,” said Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase. “Evidence from past episodes suggests it could take up to two quarters for spending to fully adjust to new tax realities.”A softer pace of consumer spending is expected to limit G.D.P. growth to a 1.8 percent rate this quarter, according to a Reuters poll of economists. For the year as a whole, economists expect growth of just 2.3 percent.A separate report from the Labor Department showed that higher oil prices helped push up the cost of imported goods by 0.6 percent last month. Import prices had fallen by 0.5 percent in December.Still, nonpetroleum import prices edged up just 0.1 percent in January and have risen just 0.2 percent over the last year, showing a lack of broad inflation pressure."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/world/europe/obama-bid-for-trade-pact-with-europe-stirs-hope.html,"BERLIN — President Obama’s call for a free-trade agreement between the United States and the European Union has unleashed a wave of optimism on both sides that a breakthrough can be achieved that would lift trans-Atlantic fortunes, not just economically but politically.Experts cited tough economic times on both sides of the Atlantic and a perceived need among European leaders for a cause to unify their frayed union as major reasons that an agreement might be reached now, where past efforts have failed. But an even greater consideration, they said, was the growing economic might of China.“There will be an agreement in the end,” said Claudia Schmucker, head of the globalization and world economy program at the German Council on Foreign Relations. “This will be the first time in 20 years where something can happen.”Proponents hope that a comprehensive trade agreement will not only raise economic growth, but also lower prices for European and American consumers and give new impetus to a relationship that has lacked forward momentum almost since the end of the cold war. Talks could begin in late May or early June.Negotiations are not expected to be easy, with entrenched interests, especially in protected sectors of the agriculture industry, fighting to maintain their subsidies and preferences. European consumers have rejected the kinds of genetically modified crops that are commonplace in the United States but are known across the Atlantic as Frankenfoods.Nevertheless, Mr. Obama’s announcement was applauded by leading politicians and business groups in Europe, especially here in Germany, and so far the news has not provoked the instant union opposition in the United States that free-trade talks with underdeveloped, low-wage countries do.Trade experts agreed that several new factors had converged to make an agreement more likely. The economic stagnation on both sides of the Atlantic has heightened the awareness that a prod to growth is needed. In a Democratic administration, free-trade agreements are much easier to reach with higher-wage, unionized countries like those in Europe that do not spook trade unions. And the cross-pollination between American and European companies, as in the auto sector, also is expected to blunt opposition from labor groups.But China may present the single most compelling factor. There is an increasing awareness that to deal with the challenge of China’s rapidly growing economy, Europe and the United States will have to learn to cooperate better.“In every trade negotiation that I know of between Europe and the U.S., China is on their minds in terms of how can we use trade negotiations to better compete,” said Jeffrey J. Schott, a senior fellow working on international trade policy at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington.While trade deals often take years to negotiate, a senior Obama administration official said that a pact is possible in as little as 18 months — before the terms of the current European commissioners end. Even so, trade experts with experience from previous rounds say they are acutely aware of how often negotiations begin with optimism and grand plans and end with intractable fights between vested interests.Karel De Gucht, the European Union’s trade commissioner, said completing a trade pact could take two years. In an interview, he said that a deal “will have a worldwide impact.” The talks were “about our place, and by our place I mean the United States and Europe, within a decade on the world economic scene,” Mr. De Gucht said.Mr. Obama devoted a single sentence to the topic in his State of the Union address, but that was what proponents of a trade deal had been hoping for. His statement set the stage for talks to remove tariff barriers and regulatory hurdles between the United States and the European Union, which are already each other’s largest trading partners.In his speech on Tuesday, Mr. Obama called the initiative the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, but the idea is an old one, much discussed during the Clinton administration under the name Tafta, something like a sequel to the Nafta deal.Mr. Obama’s reference to talks about a possible free-trade pact with the European Union was a late addition to his State of the Union address, according to a senior administration official, because a working group of the United States and the European Union had sent recommendations to Washington only on Tuesday that the two sides were close enough on various issues to pursue talks toward a comprehensive free-trade agreement, rather than a more limited one.That high-level working group has spent most of a year discussing whether the talks would cover just tariff issues, or also regulatory questions on environmental, pharmaceutical and automobile industry issues. The administration official, who declined to be identified, said the Europeans, being eager “for anything that looks like a growth strategy,” seemed “to be ready to take on some of the more difficult issues” like agriculture.There had been some frustration among supporters of a deal that more progress was not being made. “We’ve had 20 years of failure on these trans-Atlantic initiatives,” Mr. Schott said, adding, “Before they signed on the dotted line they wanted to make sure there weren’t any potholes that would trip them up.”Tariffs on goods traveling between the United States and Europe are low, averaging about 3 percent, but proponents say that the savings from eliminating duties would still be significant because the volume of trade is so enormous. Trade in goods between Europe and the United States totaled $646 billion last year, according to United States government figures.On Tuesday, two powerful American senators on the committee that would consider any draft trade agreement before it could get a Senate vote, warned that any deal must open Europe to American farm products.Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the highest-ranking Republican on the committee, wrote that a trade deal presented an “enticing opportunity” in a letter to Ron Kirk, the United States trade representative. European leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, have been pushing for a trade deal as a low-cost way of stimulating their struggling economies. The United States Chamber of Commerce and large companies like General Electric have also lobbied for an agreement.Potentially more important than abolishing tariffs, but also much more complicated, would be a deal that harmonized regulations on products like food, cars, toys and pharmaceuticals. Automobile manufacturers would like to see agreement on safety and emissions standards for cars, reducing or eliminating the need to build different versions for the American and European markets.Matthias Wissmann, head of the German Association of the Automotive Industry, said that harmonizing safety features would save several hundred dollars per automobile. Mr. De Gucht, who is expected to lead the talks on the European side, said that a deal could provide vital leverage over emerging powerhouses like China."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/business/death-after-use-of-jack3d-shows-gap-in-regulation.html,"For the last few weeks, GNC, the dietary supplements retailer, has run a special on its Web site for a workout booster called Jack3d. “Hot Buy, Hot Buy, Hot Buy,” reads a red banner splashed across the product’s page.Pronounced Jacked, the powder contains a stimulant that marketers say increases strength, speed and endurance. At VitaminShoppe.com, where Jack3d is also sold, a reviewer boasts, “My muscles have gained mass like never before.”Yet, last April, federal health regulators issued a warning that the stimulant — called dimethylamylamine, or DMAA — frequently raises blood pressure and heart rate, and could lead to heart attacks. In December 2011, after the deaths of two soldiers who had used Jack3d, the Defense Department removed all products containing DMAA from stores on military bases, including more than 100 GNC shops.Now the parents of Michael L. Sparling, one of the soldiers who died, have filed a wrongful-death lawsuit against USPlabs, the developer and marketer of Jack3d, and GNC, the store where he bought it. The suit, filed on Wednesday in state court in San Diego, claims that the companies deceptively marketed Jack3d as safe and effective while not warning consumers about its potential health risks. It seeks unspecified punitive damages.In an e-mail, Laura Brophy, a spokeswoman for GNC, which is set to announce its earnings Thursday morning, said the company did not comment on pending litigation. Representatives of USPlabs and the Vitamin Shoppe did not immediately respond to e-mail or return telephone calls seeking comment.The Sparling case highlights gaps in product safety and regulatory oversight of the $30 billion dietary supplement industry in the United States, some supplement researchers say.Under federal law, supplements are defined as natural products that contain only dietary ingredients. Yet the pharmaceutical company Eli Lilly originally developed the stimulant now used in Jack3d and other workout boosters as an inhaled drug for nasal congestion in the 1940s.With prevalent chains like GNC lending their reputations and reach to such products, the researchers fault the retailers as much as manufacturers for promoting what they see as questionable supplements.“It’s a pharmaceutical-grade product which is being directly introduced into the supplement marketplace with absolutely no regulatory oversight,” said Dr. Pieter Cohen, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School who has studied dietary supplements.In the medical literature, DMAA has often been described as a synthetic stimulant similar to amphetamines that can constrict blood vessels, raise blood pressure and heart rate, potentially increasing the risk of heart attacks and strokes. In 2005, supplement makers began to market the substance in workout and weight-loss products, often combining it with caffeine, which may enhance the stimulant’s effects. Products like Jack3d and OxyElite Pro, which USPlabs also markets, became popular among fitness buffs as part of their pre-workout routine.Although USPlabs now makes a new version of Jack3d — called Jack3d Micro — without DMAA, and the products are no longer sold on military bases, the original Jack3d remains widely available at some stores and Web sites. GNC.com said that Jack3d “produces an intense sensation of drive, focus, energy, motivation and awareness.” Last week, a reporter bought the original version of Jack3d at a GNC outlet in Midtown Manhattan. But a study commissioned by the United States military after the two soldiers died raised red flags about the safety of DMAA products. “DMAA in combination with other ingredients may be associated with significant consequences,” a team of military, sports and supplement researchers wrote in case reports about the deaths of the two soldiers that was published last December in Military Medicine, the journal of the Society of Federal Health Professionals. The researchers added, “DMAA continues to be available in dietary supplements despite the lack of evidence that it qualifies as a dietary ingredient.”The Food and Drug Administration also issued warning letters to 10 marketers of the workout boosters, but critics charge that the agency has been slow to take definitive action against the products. Health regulators in at least seven other countries, including Britain, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Canada, New Zealand and Australia, have effectively banned supplements containing DMAA.Last month, a coroner in Britain cited the stimulant in the death of Claire Squires, 30, who took Jack3d before running the London Marathon last year, collapsed late in the race and died. DMAA “on the balance of probabilities, and in combination with extreme physical exertion, caused cardiac failure which resulted in her death,” the coroner wrote in his report.The F.D.A. warnings sent to companies last spring said that the agency had no evidence that DMAA qualified as a dietary ingredient or that it was safe. Health professionals asked why, nearly a year after the warnings, retailers continued to sell products containing the stimulant.“The F.D.A.’s warning process may do little to nothing to stem the significant public health risk posed by this potentially dangerous ingredient,” Philip J. Gregory, an associate professor at the School of Pharmacy and Health Professions at Creighton University in Omaha, Neb., wrote in a research letter last December in Archives of Internal Medicine.The F.D.A. has received 60 reports of health problems in people who had ingested products containing DMAA, including reports of at least two deaths. Federal regulators cautioned that the reports did not prove the products themselves caused the health problems. Even so, they said they had safety concerns. “It was a drug. That certainly calls into question whether it even fits in the supplement space,” Daniel Fabricant, the director of the F.D.A.’s division of dietary supplement programs, said in a telephone interview last week. “We continue to send warning letters.”Steve Mister, the chief executive of the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group, said the agency had been too slow to issue a final decision about DMAA.“It is incumbent upon the F.D.A. to make a decision as to whether it is a legitimate and safe dietary ingredient,” he said.The wrongful-death lawsuit filed Wednesday adds to the legal battles being waged by USPlabs. In December, the company paid $2 million to settle a false-advertising lawsuit filed against it in California state court by consumers who bought Jack3d and OxyElite Pro. As part of the settlement, USPlabs did not admit wrongdoing, but agreed to change the labeling to make warning statements on the products larger and easier to understand. The company has also gone on the legal offensive, using the courts in an attempt to defend Jack3d’s reputation. Last October, USPlabs filed a defamation lawsuit against the owner of a supplements store in Reno, Nev., who gave a television interview about Jack3d as part of a consumer safety report on a local news broadcast. Philip Tracy, the owner of Max Muscle of Reno, described Jack3d as an “amphetaminelike compound” that “speeds up your heart rate” and could “possibly” cause death. A judge dismissed the lawsuit, which was filed in federal court in Dallas, for lack of jurisdiction. Reached via e-mail, Mr. Tracy declined to comment. The lawsuit filed by Mr. Sparling’s parents said that on the morning of June 1, 2011, Mr. Sparling took the recommended dose of Jack3d after buying it at a GNC store at Fort Bliss in El Paso. During a moderate workout with his unit — a short run interspersed with lunges up a small hill — Mr. Sparling, 22, collapsed. He died at a hospital several hours later of respiratory failure and cardiac arrest. Anne Andrews, a lawyer for Mr. Sparling’s parents, said it was appalling that GNC continued to sell Jack3d. “Jack3d is a product with well-established dangers, and the F.D.A. and medical community have made that abundantly clear,” Ms. Andrews said. “GNC has chosen financial gain over the safety of the consumer.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/business/global/japanese-economy-contracts-and-remains-in-recession.html,"TOKYO (AP) — Japan’s economy remained mired in recession late last year, shrinking 0.4 percent in annualized terms for the third straight quarter of contraction on feeble demand at home and overseas.The government reported Thursday that growth for all of 2012 was 1.9 percent, after a 0.6 percent contraction in 2011 and a 4.7 percent increase in 2010 and a 5.5 percent contraction in 2009.The figures were worse than expected, as many analysts had forecast the economy may have emerged from recession late last year as the Japanese yen weakened against other major currencies, giving a boost to Japanese export manufacturers.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who took office in late December, is championing aggressive spending and monetary stimulus to help get growth back on track. He has lobbied the central bank to set an inflation target of 2 percent, aimed at breaking out of Japan’s long bout of deflation, or falling prices, that he says are inhibiting corporate investment and growth.But the Bank of Japan was not expected to announce any major new initiatives from a policy meeting on Thursday. The current central bank governor, Masaaki Shirakawa, is due to leave office on March 19, and Mr. Abe is expected to appoint as his successor an expert who favors his more activist approach to monetary policy.Last year began on an upbeat note with annual growth in the first quarter at 6 percent as strong government spending on reconstruction from the March 2011 tsunami disaster helped spur demand. But the economy contracted in the second quarter and deteriorated further as frictions with China over a territorial dispute hurt exports to one of Japan’s largest overseas markets.Despite the dismal data for last year, many in Japan expect at least a temporary bump to growth from higher government spending on public works and other programs. An index measuring consumer confidence, released this week, jumped to its highest level since 2007, the biggest increase in a single month."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/business/global/obama-pledges-trade-pact-talks-with-eu.html,"BRUSSELS — Embarking on what could be the biggest trade agreement ever in its economic sweep, officials from the United States and the European Union indicated Wednesday that they had already resolved some of the stickiest issues behind closed doors.But the sheer ambition of the trade negotiations, which aim not only to eliminate import duties but also synchronize regulations governing products like cars, drugs and medical devices, leaves plenty of room for the talks to bog down in the type of parochial concerns that have derailed past efforts at a trans-Atlantic trade pact.Ron Kirk, the U.S. Trade Representative, said by telephone Wednesday that this time things would be different. Already, he said, preliminary discussions between him and top E.U. officials have made “very good progress” on issues that have stymied trade relations for years, like health and safety standards applied to food. A final agreement is possible before the end of 2014, he said.But, Mr. Kirk acknowledged, “we’ve still got a lot of work ahead of us.”President Barack Obama endorsed a trade pact during his State of the Union address Tuesday, answering pleas from European leaders desperate for a way to speed up economic growth. Though Mr. Obama devoted only a single sentence to the topic, it was the green light that proponents of a trade deal had been hoping for.“And tonight, I’m announcing that we will launch talks on a comprehensive Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership with the European Union,” Mr. Obama said, giving the potential pact a name. He added, “Because trade that is fair and free across the Atlantic supports millions of good-paying American jobs.”European officials on Wednesday agreed with Mr. Kirk that the timing is favorable for an agreement. And officials in both Brussels and Washington noted that the rising economic might of China gave them further incentive. A broad trade agreement could help ensure that Americans and Europeans, and not the Chinese government, would set standards on product safety or protection of intellectual property in years to come.“You will now be setting what the rules of the road are for trade that are going to shape the global trading system,” said Karan Bhatia, a former deputy U.S. trade representative who is now vice president for global government affairs at General Electric in Washington.Unless the United States and Europe are in agreement, in too many future trade cases, “we would be forced to accept Chinese standards,” Karel De Gucht, the trade commissioner who is expected to lead the talks on behalf of Europe, said during an interview. “That’s what it is about.”José Manuel Barroso, the president of the European Commission — the Union’s administrative arm — said at a news conference here that a trade pact would bolster the economies of the United States and Europe.“Both of us need growth, and both us also have budgetary difficulties,” Mr. Barroso said. “Trade is the most economic way of promoting growth.”But Mr. De Gucht, interviewed later, added a note of caution. “The low-hanging fruit doesn’t exist here any more,” he said. “All the easy topics are off the table.”European leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron of Britain and Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany, have been pushing for a trade deal as a low-cost way of stimulating their struggling economies. Mr. Obama’s statement Tuesday will help put to rest complaints by some Europeans that the U.S. president has not paid enough attention to his country’s largest trading partner.“A deal will create jobs on both sides of the Atlantic and make our countries more prosperous,” Mr. Cameron said in statement. “Breaking down the remaining trade barriers and securing a comprehensive deal will require hard work and bold decisions on both sides.”Between them, the United States and Europe account for about half of global economic output and one-third of world trade. Trade in goods between the Union and America totaled $646 billion last year, according to U.S. government figures.According to Mr. Kirk, the trade representative, the Union is the best customer for U.S. exports, buying $459 billion in goods and services and supporting 2.4 million American jobs.“I don’t know if I would call it the biggest trade agreement in the history of the planet,” Mr. Kirk said, “but it is really a very big deal.”Tariffs on goods traveling between the United States and Europe are already low, averaging about 3 percent. But the saving from eliminating duties would still be significant because the volume is so enormous.“One of the big winners is the aircraft sector, where the tariff rate is very low but value is so high,” Peter Chase, vice president for Europe of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, said during a conference call with reporters Wednesday. Duties on aircraft come to about $450 million a year, he said. “That’s a lot of money by anyone’s count.”With his use of the word “comprehensive” in his speech Tuesday, Mr. Obama indicated that negotiators planned to go beyond tariffs and attempt to eliminate regulatory inconsistencies that, for example, force the German carmaker Audi to build different versions of its vehicles for the U.S. and European markets, or require drug makers to seek approvals for new medicines on both continents.Mr. Obama, presumably, would not have put his imprimatur on such an ambitious trade agenda unless he were confident of success. A so-called high-level working group including Mr. Kirk and Mr. De Gucht spent most of a year discussing the framework for talks; it issued its report Wednesday after a delay of several months. One reason for the delay was that officials wanted to make sure ahead of time that they could overcome historic points of contention.“We don’t want to spend 10 years negotiating what are well-known issues and not reach a result,” Michael Froman, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, said on a conference call with reporters Wednesday.The increasing economic importance of emerging-market countries in Asia and Latin America, which threatens the economic supremacy of the United States and Europe, adds another measure of urgency.A deal “will have a worldwide impact,” said Mr. De Gucht, the Union’s trade commissioner. He said the talks were “about our place — and by our place I mean the United States and Europe — within a decade on the world economic scene.”The similarities between Europe and America in culture and legal systems mean that harmonizing regulations should be possible. Both, for example, impose strict safety and emissions requirements on automobiles, even if their regulations differ in important ways. While there is no talk of creating joint U.S. and European regulatory agencies, Mr. De Gucht said that “perhaps it makes sense to look together at putting in place a system of mutual recognition.”But with many sensitive and complex issues to overcome, two powerful U.S. senators warned Tuesday, anticipating Mr. Obama’s speech, that any deal must open Europe to American farm products.Max Baucus, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, and Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the highest-ranking Republican on the committee, said that a trade deal presented an “enticing opportunity.”But in a letter to Mr. Kirk, they also wrote: “Broad bipartisan Congressional support for expanding trade with the E.U. depends, in large part, on lowering trade barriers for American agricultural products.”Food issues have long been an obstacle to more open trade between America and Europe. Many Europeans object to genetically modified crops and products derived from cloned animals that are commonplace in the United States.A senior official in the Obama administration, who declined to be identified, said the Europeans, being eager “for anything that looks like a growth strategy,” seemed “to be ready to take on some of the more difficult issues” like agriculture.Mr. Barroso told reporters Wednesday that restrictions in Europe on genetically modified crops would not be up for discussion, a statement that seemed to conflict with U.S. demands that restrictions be based solely on scientific evidence.“These negotiations are not about compromising the health of our consumers for commercial gains,” Mr. Barroso said.But Mr. De Gucht said some European laws on growing biotech products were already under revision and the outcome could help to diffuse trans-Atlantic tensions.Another complicating factor will be the nature of the European Union, with its 27 members who do not agree among themselves on all trade issues. There is some concern in France over the prospect of looser restrictions on agricultural products, or the dismantling of regulations designed to promote French films and other cultural products.Mr. De Gucht said he did not intend to negotiate with his hands tied by the demands of any single European country. Even so, he conceded, “I’m also living in the real world, and I know this is difficult for, by the way not only for France, but for a number of member states.”Jack Ewing reported from Frankfurt.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/nyregion/quinns-affordable-housing-plan-revisits-tax-caps-rejected-by-bloomberg.html,"A centerpiece of Christine C. Quinn’s plan to keep housing affordable in New York City is a variation on a proposed tax subsidy for landlords that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg forcefully rejected two years ago as an unacceptably generous giveaway to the real estate industry.Aides to Ms. Quinn, the speaker of the City Council and a leading Democratic candidate for mayor, acknowledged that the idea had come from the city’s real estate industry, one of Ms. Quinn’s closest allies and biggest campaign donors.But, the aides said, Ms. Quinn had altered the proposal in important ways since it was heavily criticized by the Bloomberg administration, and predicted that it could, over time, preserve the dwindling supply of apartments that are within reach of the city’s middle-class families.She unveiled the plan in her State of the City speech on Monday.The measure and its origins highlight a recurring tension in Ms. Quinn’s rise to political power, between her passion as a former housing activist for liberal causes and her growing willingness to work with the corporate interests that control the levers of power in the city.Her proposal would impose a 30-year cap on real estate taxes for landlords who renew participation in a program that sets aside 20 percent of apartments for below-market rents. With dozens of landlords threatening to withdraw from that program, known as 80-20 or 421a, Ms. Quinn said that a new tax cap would encourage them to keep charging lower rents, rather than convert units into market-rate apartments or condominiums.“Good ideas can come from just about anybody,” Ms. Quinn said in an interview on Wednesday, when asked about the real estate industry’s role. Recalling her days as a housing activist, she said it was impractical to formulate a serious affordable housing plan without the industry’s participation.“If you are a housing organizer not willing to talk to landlords and developers, in addition to tenants, what are you getting done?” she asked.City developers and landlords, led by their powerful trade group, the Real Estate Board of New York, have long sought a real estate tax cap, which would guarantee them a discounted and predictable long-term tax bill in return for renting out some apartments at below-market rates.At the current tax rates in prime neighborhoods, the developers say, there is no financial incentive to maintain affordable apartments in their buildings; a tax cap would help alleviate that problem, they say.Critics contend a tax cap gives highly profitable developers a sizable tax break on an entire building when a vast majority of apartments inside are rented at prevailing — and in New York City, generally quite high — rates.“Whenever the real estate industry is framing the debate around affordable housing, tenants are going to lose,” said Jaron Benjamin, executive director of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a tenants’ rights group.He expressed dismay over the concept of the tax cap. “It’s almost identical” to the Real Estate Board’s proposal, Mr. Benjamin said. “We think it’s a big mistake to give wealthy developers subsidies.”Aides to Mr. Bloomberg said they were surprised, even startled, to see the tax cap proposal prominently featured in Ms. Quinn’s speech.When the real estate industry sought a similar set of tax incentives through a bill in the New York State Legislature in 2011, Mr. Bloomberg’s office singled out the tax cap for criticism. In a memo, a top aide said the plan was “not, fundamentally, an affordable housing program,” but “a large tax break dressed up as a housing policy.”Ms. Quinn’s aides said that her current proposal, which caps real estate taxes at a substantially higher rate than proposed by the Real Estate Board two years ago, would cost the city far less money.“The concept and the framework are the same,” said Preston Niblack, Ms. Quinn’s director of finance, “but the fact that we are talking about a cap that is much higher than the original cap makes this significantly less costly and not a giveaway.”Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board, said that while he was pleased Ms. Quinn had raised the issue of a tax cap, he needed greater detail. His members, he said, wanted Ms. Quinn to set the cap at 20 percent of their total rental income per building. That is well below Ms. Quinn’s goal of 28 to 31 percent.Ms. Quinn said she wanted developers and landlords to “break even” on their investment in affordable housing units in gentrifying neighborhoods, not earn money.Several of the companies most likely to benefit from a tax cap are major donors to Ms. Quinn. Related Companies, for example, has given her more than $40,000 since 2009.“That has no relationship to what position I take on issues,” Ms. Quinn said. “My goal here is not to make any member of the real estate industry, whether they are donors or not, happy.”Ms. Quinn estimated the cap would cost about $400 million in lost taxes over the next decade.Her proposal comes at a time when Democratic officeholders have increasingly expressed concern about subsidies to developers.“We’ve been giving away property taxes at an astounding rate,” said Senator Liz Krueger, a Democrat from the Upper East Side. “The city has a long history of giving away the store to powerful people in real estate. You have to be extremely careful.”Ms. Quinn said she would vigilantly police the cost. “Is threading this needle complicated? she asked. “Absolutely.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/opinion/preventing-a-currency-war.html,"The Group of 7 industrialized countries appeared to tamp down talk of a currency war in a statement this week that said markets should determine exchange rates and that countries should use fiscal and monetary policies to achieve faster growth. It may help curb fears that stagnant economies will devalue their currencies to make their exports more affordable relative to competitors.The statement came in response to sharp moves in currencies like the euro and the yen and calls by some Group of 7 countries like France for policies that could lead to competitive devaluations.The yen, for instance, has fallen by about 11 percent against the dollar since the recent election in Japan of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who has pushed for economic stimulus and more aggressive asset purchases by the Bank of Japan to fight deflation. Critics say those policies are aimed at lowering the value of the yen, which Mr. Abe’s government has denied.And last week President François Hollande of France proposed that euro-zone nations should adopt a policy to manage the value of the common currency to maintain the competitiveness of European goods. (The euro has appreciated about 2 percent against the dollar and nearly 10 percent against the yen this year.)Such misguided thinking can lead only to chaos and retaliation. If all countries were to competitively devalue their currencies, the result would be a downward spiral that would benefit no one, but could lead to high inflation. Certainly in Europe, altering exchange rates is not the answer; reviving economies will require giving up on austerity, which is choking demand and investment.Developing countries like Brazil and Mexico also complain that looser monetary policy in industrialized nations can produce effects similar to currency manipulation. When central banks in countries like Japan and the United States pump more money into their financial systems, investors are driven to put their money into emerging markets where interest rates are higher. That pushes up currencies like the real and peso, making exports from those countries more expensive on the world market. Instead of responding to this effect by manipulating their exchange rates, those countries could protect themselves from volatile capital flows by regulating them.With much of Europe in a recession, Japan struggling with deflation, and the weak American economy potentially falling back into a recession if the automatic spending cuts go through, the global economy is fragile. The last thing the world needs is a currency war."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/politics/david-leonhardt-washington-bureau-chief-answers-readers-questions.html,"David Leonhardt, Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, answered readers’ questions on Thursday about the economic landscape and President Obama’s prospects to enact the ambitious legislative agenda he laid out in his State of the Union address.Mr. Leonhardt is the author of the e-book, “Here’s the Deal: How Washington Can Solve the Deficit and Spur Growth,” published by The Times and Byliner. Previously, he wrote the paper’s Economic Scene column.Below are answers to selected questions. Q.     So presidents make their State of the Union speech then hit the road to sell it. Wouldn't it be more effective to just stay in D.C. and do the heavy lifting of pushing Congress off of square one?  A.  My colleague Michael Shear writes from Georgia, where is he reporting on President Obama’s trip today:Recent presidents have made a habit of getting out of Washington to pitch their State of the Union ideas in front of largely friendly crowds who can -- the White House hopes -- put some political pressure on the lawmakers in Washington. Bill Clinton did it after proposing health reform (with little success). George W. Bush did it, too, after proposing Social Security changes (also with little success).For Mr. Obama, staying in Washington is exactly what he doesn't want to do. He and his aides became frustrated in his first year by the endless health care negotiations that made him feel trapped in the weeds of a political process for which Americans don't have good feelings. The White House staff and the president have concluded that more time outside Washington will actually help the gridlocked process of legislating, by potentially putting political pressure on legislators.There is a downside, though. The visits have a decidedly campaign-like feel that can lend credence to the accusation that the president is more concerned about political appearances than the business of governing. Mr. Obama has concluded that risk is worth it. But it's not clear from recent history that the trips have actually helped achieve a president's goals. Q. When the debt was the largest in history as a percent of GDP, in 1946, we had 27 years of mostly deficit spending. The debt in dollars doubled. But we had prosperity. Why don't we do that today?  A.  You're right that a country can have deficits and still pay down its debt, so long as the deficits are small enough and economic growth fast enough. And you're right that some government spending plays a crucial role in creating economic growth. The most important programs seem to be investments -- in education, scientific research, roads, bridges and the like -- that the private sector won't do on its own.The Internet, the radio, the jet engine, much of biotechnology and the technique for extracting a form of natural gas known as shale gas all owe their beginnings to federal spending. This history is a major theme in ""Here's the Deal.""But government spending and debt most certainly do not ensure prosperity. Federal debt is already high. The projections showing that annual deficits will fall in the next few years depend on some assumptions that may prove rosy. And as more baby boomers retire and health costs keep rising, projected deficits are projected to rise again, sharply, in coming decades.As heartening as the recent progress on the deficit may be, the country still faces substantial long-term fiscal problems. If we don't deal with them, we are likely to have an economy that looks nothing like the prosperous economy after World War II. Q.     Congressional Republicans recently decided against using the debt limit as a lever to force President Obama to enact spending cuts he wouldn't otherwise go along with. Is there any indication that Republicans will agree to a longer-term extension once the current limit is reached?  A.  It's hard to know, but it's possible that the debt-ceiling fights will not continue. In the past, the extension of the debt ceiling tended to be an opportunity for the party that didn't hold the White House to grandstand about the deficit and debt. (President Obama, somewhat famously, did so in 2006.) In the end, though, the extension tended to pass without any concessions from the president.In 2011, Congressional Republicans successfully negotiated such concessions from Mr. Obama. In recent months, he made clear that he would not negotiate over the debt ceiling again, citing the economic damage from the uncertainty over the last extension. Republicans have gone along, at least temporarily.Polls suggest the last fight hurt Republicans more than Democrats, which suggests Republicans may ultimately agree to a long-term extension or simply a series of short-term extensions. On the other hand, they were indeed able to win some spending cuts in 2011, so some in the party continue to see the debt ceiling as a powerful tool.The most cliched last line in journalism -- the kicker, as we say -- is: Time will tell. I can't think of another kicker here. Q.     Why has the administration given so much focus to gun control in the past few weeks? With a Republican majority in the House and the fact that many Democrats would also vote against advanced gun control measures, would this kind of legislation have a chance of passing the House or the Senate?  A.  Unlike past mass shootings, the killings in Newtown, Conn., shifted the national debate. Public opinion changed modestly, and Democrats who favor more gun control became more willing to push for it.As you note, most Republicans and some Democrats oppose sweeping new measures, which is why an assault-weapons ban still seems unlikely. But some other measures may be able to win overwhelming support from Democrats and enough from Republicans to pass both the House and Senate. The two leading candidates are an expansion of criminal background checks on people buying guns and a new federal trafficking law to block criminal purchases.A recent Pew Research Center poll found that 85 percent of Americans favor background checks. Support at so high of a level, combined with national attention to the issues, has the potential to create a majority in both houses of Congress. Q.     The Wall Street macro indexes e.g. S&P500, DOW, are at or around historical highs. However I do  not see corresponding growth in GDP let alone increase in employment rate to underpin this rally.What is driving this and where is the money coming from? How does this benefit ""middle America""?  A.  First, the indexes themselves are not at or near record highs when viewed properly. When adjusted for inflation, the Standard & Poor 500 index was more than 30 percent higher in 2000 than it is today. Including the value of dividends, the S&P was still about 5 percent higher in 2000 than now. And taking into account investment costs, which nearly everyone pays, the gap would be substantially more than 5 percent.I say this not to be an inflation nerd (though I am) but to make the point that the stock market is not in fact more valuable than it’s ever been. When Wall Street proclaims, “record high!” and we in the media repeat the claim, we’re presenting a false picture of reality. Stocks are still not as valuable as they were at the peak of the dot-com bubble.Your larger point, though, is dead on. The S&P 500 (including dividends and inflation) is about 18 percent higher than it was five years ago, which is roughly when the recession began. The overall economy has not fared nearly so well. Gross domestic product was only about 2 percent larger at the end of last year than five years earlier. The unemployment rate is 7.9 percent, up from 5 percent five years ago.For a complex stew of reasons – including, but not limited to, government assistance for the financial sector since 2007 – American companies and financial firms have recovered more quickly from the crisis than most of the rest of the economy. Q.     What are President Obama's plans to lure high-tech manufacturing back to the United States? He courts Silicon Valley and named Apple during his State of the Union, but Steve Jobs famously said manufacturing will never return for logistical reasons. Tim Cook, despite the return of a single Mac line, appears to have little desire to change the company's strategic plan.  A.  My colleague Annie Lowrey responds:President Obama's White House is sold on the idea that high-tech manufacturing punches above its weight, economically speaking, by boosting American innovation and competitiveness. Thus, the White House has pushed hard for what amounts to an industrial policy for manufacturing, a policy shepherded by Gene B. Sperling, the director of the National Economic Council.The ideas are many. The White House has proposed billions of dollars of tax credits, an $8 billion ""community college to career"" fund, worker training initiatives, tax reforms and trade policy measures, all aimed at creating or keeping manufacturing jobs.But the implemented policies are few, given the need for Congress to pass and fund many of them. Still, the Obama administration has devoted federal dollars to promote promising nascent technologies and to developing industrial ""clusters,"" for instance.Moreover, the 2009 stimulus bill contained billions of dollars of support for green-energy projects, often with manufacturing components. It's also worth noting that there are billions of dollars of pre-existing tax credits and programs that aid companies that make their products in the United States, at the federal, state and local levels. Q.     Would increasing minimum wage be effective at raising the standard of living? Wouldn't costs just shift with it?  A.  History suggests pretty clearly that an increase in the minimum wage would help the great majority of workers now earning the minimum wage. Increasing the minimum wage may lead to some job loss, but it does not appear to lead to large amounts of job loss, research has found. Most employers instead absorb the costs of the higher wages.The higher wages may come out of a business’s profits (and, by extension, the income of the business’s owners or stock holders). Or, as your question suggests, the higher wages may come out of consumers’ pockets, via higher prices.The net effect is roughly the same, though. An increase in the minimum wage shifts some income now flowing to high- and middle-income workers to low-income workers instead. An increase in the minimum wage, in other words, seems to have a bigger effect on the distribution of the nation’s economic pie than on the size of it.But the increase proposed by President Obama, to $9 an hour, almost certainly would not erase the large shift in income away from low-income workers in recent years. Over the last 25 years, household income at the 10th percentile – that is, among those households earning less than nine out of 10 others and more than one out of 10 others  – has increased only 2 percent, after adjusting for inflation, according to the Census Bureau. At the median, the increase has been 3 percent. At the 95th percentile, the increase has been 23 percent. And for the very rich, the increases have been larger still. Q.     Has the atmosphere in Congress become any less toxic in the aftermath of President Obama's reelection?  A.  I don’t know about toxicity, but it has become less predictably partisan. Some Republicans have become more willing to negotiate with the administration, rather than to stand on principle and oppose it.Why? In the first term, Republicans decided that they held veto power over perhaps President Obama’s central promise: to be a bipartisan bridge builder. As Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican minority leader, told my colleagues Carl Hulse and Adam Nagourney in 2010, a bill is “either bipartisan or it isn’t.” By uniformly opposing the president’s agenda, Republicans thought they could frustrate his liberal aims, make him seem ineffective and deny him a second term.Once he won a second term, the party’s strategy shifted somewhat. Republican leaders were well aware of polling showing that most voters viewed them as less willing to compromise than Mr. Obama. Some Republicans also came to lament that they did not negotiate more on the health-care overhaul and other bills, which would have allowed them to win more concessions. So on a couple of recent bills – an effective tax increase on the affluent, aid for the aftermath of the Sandy storm – some Republicans have become more willing to make a deal. Others in the party have continued to vote no but have allowed bills to pass.Will it continue? It depends how long Republicans see compromise as being in their interest – and whether Mr. Obama and the Democrats, newly emboldened, push so hard on various items that they leave Republicans no room to compromise comfortably. Immigration seems the most likely area for further compromise, given the Republican need to improve their image among Latinos. The budget is another possibility."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/business/smallbusiness/small-businesses-struggle-impeding-a-recovery.html,"In the recovery so far, small businesses have largely been left behind. Initially, loans were hard to come by and consumers weren’t shopping. Now, small-business owners say, Washington is throwing up additional roadblocks.In survey after survey, owners of small businesses report unbridled pessimism about the economy. The small-business optimism index from the National Federation of Independent Business — a major industry group for small businesses that surveys a sample of its members each month — is stuck at recessionary levels. In January’s report, released this week, expectations for business conditions six months from now were at their fourth-lowest reading in nearly 40 years.Comparable measures for large companies have exceeded their prerecession levels. That is partly because big companies have a larger global footprint, so they are benefiting from strong growth in places like China and India. Small businesses are more closely tied to the leaden domestic economy, said Paul Ballew, chief analytic and data officer at Dun & Bradstreet, so weak growth at home is weighing more heavily on them.That gulf in optimism between small and large companies seems to widen, though, during occasions of greater policy uncertainty and Washington gridlock — including the present. And while small businesses always grumble about taxes and regulation, they are especially likely to do so now. Asked by the National Federation of Independent Business about their “single most important problem,” small-business owners are now as likely to name taxes or government requirements as they are to name sales, which had reigned supreme from September 2008 until mid-2012.“Politicians are uniformly quick to offer paeans to small businesses, but their actions have directly held back the sector, to the huge detriment of the economy,” said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. “The timing of this latest slump is particularly frustrating because the key precondition for a real small-business recovery — the normalization of bank lending to commercial and industrial companies — is within reach.”It is unclear why policy and economic uncertainty would be taking a greater toll on small versus large businesses.Smaller companies might have be more alarmed by headlines about the debt ceiling and fiscal tightening because they don’t have armies of in-house analysts to advise them about relative risks, said Nicholas Bloom, an economics professor at Stanford who maintains an index on policy uncertainty.Smaller businesses are also more fixated on domestic uncertainty because they are less diversified than big firms — both geographically and in terms of product lines — and so have smaller margins for error. The last several years have offered multiple false starts in the domestic economy (remember “Recovery Summer” in 2010?), and small businesses that acted on any sense of optimism often found themselves badly burned.Ralph Jensen, president of Pro Data IV, a nine-person accounting and bookkeeping firm in Green Bay, Wis., has watched and learned. He would like to open another office in Appleton, about 30 miles south, and hire a new employee. But he is concerned about how another blowup in Washington, or at the very least lingering uncertainty about tax increases and spending cuts, might affect his clients’ expansion plans.Unlike a big company that can take a tax write-off for investing in space or equipment it ends up not needing, “I just don’t have much wiggle room if I fail,” he said.Before he would feel comfortable expanding, he said, “I’d have to see my business is growing consistently for a long time, and I would have to have really, really strong faith in the fact that people were going to be opening more businesses around here that would be looking for services like mine.”No matter what fiscal showdown Washington might have in the coming weeks, recent Congressional decisions have already had concrete effects on the economic security of small businesses.Many business owners report continued confusion about what their health care liabilities will be in 2014, for example, when some employers will be required to offer health insurance and other changes to health benefits kick in.Owners who sell directly to consumers say they are also concerned about the effects that Congress’s recent tax increases, like the end of the payroll tax holiday, will have on their bottom line.“You know I’m in kind of a unique situation in that I don’t sell anything that anybody needs, the way you need groceries or some other things,” said Jason Starkey, the owner of Starkey Products, in Orange City, Fla., which sells lighting products and other accessories that are installed in new cars. “I know I’ve noticed the tax hike that just occurred, so people making $50,000 to $60,000, the people who buy our products, must be noticing it, too.”The latest commercial and industrial lending numbers from the Federal Reserve suggest that the credit market for small businesses is healing. Rising housing values, too, are good for small-business borrowers, who often take out personal loans to finance their businesses.But many small businesses are still struggling to have their credit needs met.“The banks are not lending. They claim they are, but they’re not,” said Summit Kumar, president of Summit Telecom, a telecommunications company in Hicksville, N.Y. “I got a line of credit from a bank five years ago and I paid it back. Now the same bank says I’m ‘high-risk business’ and turns me away.” He acknowledges that his business has taken a hit in recent years and that he has had to lay off employees, but he says that his inability to get credit is part of the problem. He says he has had to resort to cash advance companies that expect him to pay back loans at exorbitant interest rates. One alternative lender said it would give him $50,000 if he paid it back with $75,000 six months later.The struggles of small businesses ripple through the rest of the economy. They are reluctant to invest in expensive capital equipment, for one.Mr. Starkey said that eight or nine years ago he could have justified investing in a $25,000 piece of equipment that would help him make a particular piece for a Ford Mustang, since he knew he would be able to earn back his investment in six months. But today, he doesn’t know if he will be able to get a return in six months or two years, and “having that kind of money tied up in one item is just too great a risk.”Metrics of small-business hiring and hiring intentions are also very low, according to the National Federation of Independent Business and the Labor Department. That might partly explain why so many middle-age women have dropped out of the labor force in recent years, said Mr. Shepherdson of Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisers, since women are more likely to be employed at smaller service sector companies than, say, manufacturers.“Until the small-business sector starts to feel better,” he said, “the rest of the economy isn’t going to feel much better either.”"
