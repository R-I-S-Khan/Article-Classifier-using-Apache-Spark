It covers the latest in pop music criticism, trends and news.Last month, the earnest rapper Logic released “Bobby Tarantino II,” which made its debut at the top of the Billboard album chart. It was the culmination of a determined climb from backpack-rap obscurity to pop-rap ubiquity, and perhaps early notice of an imminent realignment of rap’s power structure.Its reign was short, though. After just one week, it was knocked out of the top spot by a rapper working the polar opposite of the moral spectrum: XXXTentacion, the most versatile artist of the SoundCloud rap generation, and also the one with the most heinous allegations of criminal behavior.These two artists are both successes of modern internet-driven fandom. And even though their musical and thematic approaches are very different, they have things in common that might not be evident from a surface read, in terms of the emotional language they deploy and the way they connect with young hip-hop fans.To discuss these artists, and how they relate to examples of male frailty in earlier generations of pop music, Mr. Caramanica is joined on this week’s Popcast by Lindsay Zoladz, a staff writer at the Ringer and former pop music critic for New York magazine.Email your questions, thoughts and ideas about what’s happening in pop music to popcast@nytimes.com."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/10/arts/music/cardi-b-invasion-of-privacy-review.html,"Cardi B’s two breakthrough singles — “Bodak Yellow,” which went to No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 last year, and “Bartier Cardi” — posited the Bronx social media savant turned-reality-TV scene-stealer turned rapper as a pugilist preaching the virtues of triumphing over difficult circumstances, the power of sexual agency and the satisfying payoff of hard work. She sounded ecstatic, and also ready for a rumble at any turn.And so “Be Careful,” the third single from her major-label debut album, “Invasion of Privacy,” was a heady swerve. The beat is a tinkle, not a gloomy horror soundtrack, and even though Cardi is rapping with ferocity, she’s also stepping gingerly; the subject is her heart, and she doesn’t want to fracture it. At the bridge, she interpolates Lauryn Hill’s “Ex-Factor,” and she sings the hook with an enchanting rawness. That she’s not a trained singer is the thing — she’s most effective at her most unvarnished.Cardi B moves seamlessly between these modes — taking a gut punch one moment, delivering one the next. She is more versatile than most rappers or pop stars of any stripe. And what’s most promising about the exuberant and impressive “Invasion of Privacy” — an album full of thoughtful gestures, few of them wasteful — is that it’s a catalog of directions Cardi, 25, might go in, slots she might fill, or even invent.[ Never miss a pop music story: Sign up for our weekly newsletter, Louder. ]Much as Cardi B’s ascent to music stardom has been unconventional, so is her approach to maintaining her place there. The Cardi of this concise and purposeful album is as confident on the breezy trap anthem “Drip” (featuring Migos, which includes her fiancé, Offset) as on the power-of-positive-thinking sermon “Best Life,” featuring sermonizer Chance the Rapper. “I Like It,” featuring the Puerto Rican rapper-singer Bad Bunny and the Colombian lite-reggaeton star J Balvin, is undeniable, both for its smoothness and also its revising of “I Like It Like That,” the boogaloo classic by Pete Rodriguez.Here alone are three possible Cardis: switchblade Cardi, empowerment-seminar Cardi, pan-Latin-unifier Cardi. And those aren’t even all of them. On “She Bad” and “I Do,” she raps about sex with the assertiveness and raw detail of Lil’ Kim or Too Short. And on “Thru Your Phone,” she’s convincingly broken by an untrustworthy partner: “I might just cut all the tongues out your sneakers/Smash your TV from Best Buy/You gon’ turn me into Left Eye.”“Invasion of Privacy” is also, notably, a hip-hop album that doesn’t sound like any of its temporal peers: It is not a samey post-trap longread designed for zoned-out maximal streaming, nor does it flirt with the sonic and thematic excesses of the SoundCloud generation. In fact, it’s more reminiscent of the late 1990s and early 2000s, when New York rap was beginning to test its pop edges.And though it’s a debut album, it’s by no means a debut: Cardi B has been famous for years already, first as a libertine social-media slice-of-life comic, and later as an effervescently campy reality-television standout. Both of those sorts of fame are relatively young, though. Succeeding in music has generally been thought to require something more than the natural vim and charm that she’s deployed to this point.And yet, that is partly a hip-hop myth deployed by gatekeepers. Cardi proves it’s a lie: The skills she has been deploying to hilarious effect in her other careers are exactly the ones that make her music so invigorating. Few artists of any kind are so visibly and infectiously enthused.As a result, the appetite for her is insatiable, and the career milestones are coming fast and furious: co-hosting  “The Tonight Show” alongside Jimmy Fallon, appearing on the covers of various magazines, announcing her pregnancy during a performance on “Saturday Night Live.”She has also been the most reliable hip-hop guest star of the last 12 months, with appearances on G-Eazy’s “No Limit,” Migos’s “MotorSport,” Ozuna’s “La Modelo” and the remix of Bruno Mars’s “Finesse” — she has yet to release a dud. For someone who only started rapping a few years ago, that stylistic versatility is striking — it shows Cardi to be a quick study. And indeed, in a recent interview with Ebro Darden for Apple’s Beats 1, she spoke openly about wanting to improve as a rapper and working with a more experienced rapper and songwriter, Pardison Fontaine, to improve her technical skills. “I needed a little bit of help from breaking out of my box,” she said. “I need to learn how to flow a little bit easier and cleaner.” (There was some consternation online after an old video of Mr. Fontaine performing part of “Be Careful” recently resurfaced online. Atlantic Records did not make songwriting credits for “Invasion of Privacy” available.)The hard work shows, especially in terms of her cadences, and her ease in adapting to various production styles. Her quick-jab rhymes aren’t particularly complex, but occasionally she gets off a delicious turn of phrase, like this one, from “Money Bag”: “These bitches salty, they sodium, they jelly, petroleum/Always talking in the background, don’t never come to the podium.”The work of becoming a great rapper is something that’s rarely spoken about, but Cardi has been open about her education process, an implicit acknowledgment that her path to success has been unusual. It is one way rap stars are made today, and may be for the foreseeable future — not by triumphing over other rhymeslingers in Darwinian fashion, but by arriving to the genre as a fully formed personality, and then learning how to shrink-wrap that personality around beats.This is a new paradigm, one that puts charm before bona fides. It is what happens when a genre is exposed to sunlight and expands beyond the internal logic that once drove it. But it’s not enough for Cardi to win on those terms — she wants to succeed on the old ones, too."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/16/arts/music/cardi-b-invasion-of-privacy-billboard-chart.html,"Last summer, with her ubiquitous hit “Bodak Yellow,” Cardi B became the first female rapper since Lauryn Hill in 1998 to reach No. 1 on the Billboard singles chart with a fully solo release — that is, with no “feature” appearance by another artist (say, a male rapper).Now, Cardi B has pulled off a similar feat on the album chart, as her “Invasion of Privacy” (KSR/Atlantic) opens at No. 1 with the equivalent of 255,000 album sales in the United States, according to Nielsen. As Billboard noted, she is only the fifth female rapper in history to top the chart, after Nicki Minaj, Eve, Foxy Brown and Ms. Hill.“Invasion of Privacy” also had the highest streaming week ever for a female artist, with 202.6 million streams of tracks from the album, beating Beyoncé, who logged 115 million for “Lemonade” two years ago. In addition to the streams, “Invasion of Privacy” had 103,000 sales as a complete album, on formats like CD and download.Also this week, Thirty Seconds to Mars, the rock band featuring the actor Jared Leto, opened at No. 2 with “America,” and the Weeknd’s new EP “My Dear Melancholy,” which started at No. 1 last week, fell to No. 3. The soundtrack to “The Greatest Showman” is in fourth place, and XXXTentacion’s “?” is No. 5."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/04/arts/music/dr-octagon-moosebumps-jean-grae-quelle-chris-everythings-fine-review.html,"One of the most gratifying aspects of hip-hop’s relentless growth and expansion has been variety — the genre no longer has a true conceptual or geographic center, which means the rules are constantly up for debate and reinvention, and a host of unusual ideas manage to find a home under what’s become a big umbrella.And yet that has been something of a setback for those making hip-hop indebted to the idiosyncracies of the mid-to-late 1990s hip-hop underground. In that era, that scene served as a quasi-moral counterweight — sometimes implicit, sometimes explicit — to the mainstream wing of the genre, just then arriving into the pop klieg lights. It was proposed as an alternative (even if there were more consonances than were openly discussed at the time), and was bolstered by being the opposition to something too grand.As hip-hop’s growth steps have become more micro, though, truly resistant rap countermovements have been shunted even further to the fringes. It is perhaps tougher than ever to be truly outré. That makes a pair of impressive new albums by veterans of the 1990s underground even more refreshing.“Moosebumps: An Exploration Into Modern Day Horripilation” is the proper follow-up, 22 years later, to the fantastically screwy Dr. Octagon debut album, “Dr. Octagonecologyst.” It restores the original lineup: Kool Keith, one of the great non sequitur rappers of all time (Dr. Octagon is one of his many aliases); the lavish producer Dan the Automator; and the turntablist innovator DJ Qbert.Like some amalgam of science fiction fabulist and pornographer, Kool Keith — a 1980s innovator turned ’90s eccentric turned 2000s mystery — pinballs among topics, sentiments and scenes. His tone is amelodic, declarative and a touch absent-minded, as if starting fresh with each rhyme. A random sample of touchstones: Lynn Swann, Tyrannosaurus rex, laundry detergent, onion rings. He finds magic in the absurd and the minute. It is a style almost impossible to emulate.That it sounds natural over Dan the Automator’s production is a real feat. He is a meticulous pastiche artist, playing with the lusciousness of 1970s orchestral soul, the boom-bap of late-80s and early-90s hip-hop, and the left-field ambience of library records and film scores. His drums and strings are intermingled with roars and squeaks and bleeps, all orderly and not cacophonous. Qbert, when given room, is ferocious, an aggressor who understands his place as part of the symphony.As unconventional albums go, “Moosebumps” is surprisingly direct; its creators are steeped in hip-hop tradition, even if their lens on it is decidedly skewed. But there are also genre dissenters who play with structure, as heard on “Everything’s Fine,” by Jean Grae & Quelle Chris, a robust and in places odd album that takes on social numbness in a time of extreme political shock.Ms. Grae was a member of the acclaimed mid-90s independent rap group Natural Resource and is, as ever, a blisteringly acute rapper. Quelle Chris is a fun conceptualist. (The two have deeply interwoven creative lives and recently got engaged.) Their rhythms can be jagged, but in simpatico ways, and the slightly off-tilt production has echoes of the plaint of the Native Tongues and early Outkast. Various comedians and rappers show up throughout the album — Nick Offerman, Hannibal Buress, Your Old Droog — to contribute quick narrative assists.This is an album that takes familiar hip-hop starting points and denatures them, resulting in a compelling collage that feels structurally untethered to hip-hop then or now. The results alternate between tragic and comic, but the ambition is steadily high throughout.These two albums are among a potent handful of recent works that carry forward some of the spirit of the ’90s underground in varying ways. You hear it in El-P’s grindcore-rap production for Run the Jewels, or the stream-of-consciousness storytelling of Open Mike Eagle, or in the fantastically clever complexities of Milo (a.k.a. Scallops Hotel). All together, they serve as reminders of the genre’s untapped flexibility, the paths few bother to explore."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/26/arts/music/black-panther-soundtrack-billboard-chart.html,"In its second week out, the “Black Panther” soundtrack is unmoved from No. 1 on the Billboard album chart.“Black Panther the Album: Music From and Inspired By” (Top Dawg/Aftermath/Interscope), masterminded in part by Kendrick Lamar, and also featuring SZA, the Weeknd, Schoolboy Q and 2 Chainz, had the equivalent of 131,000 sales in the United States last week, according to Nielsen. That included 40,000 copies sold as a full album and nearly 120 million streams. In total it lost only 15 percent of its opening-week sales — a sign of staying power when big albums can drop 80 percent or more in Week 2.So far 2018 has been a big year for soundtracks, with two albums connected to films going to No. 1; the year began with two weeks at the top for “The Greatest Showman,” the P.T. Barnum biopic. According to Billboard, it is the first time in four years that two soundtracks have each notched more than one week at No. 1. (This week, “The Greatest Showman” holds at No. 3.)Also this week, Migos’s “Culture II” is No. 2, and two new albums round out the Top 5: Nipsey Hussle’s “Victory Lap” is in fourth place, and Brandi Carlile’s “By the Way, I Forgive You” is fifth."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/arts/music/kendrick-lamar-black-panther-soundtrack-review.html,"All the symbolic weight attached to “Black Panther” — as a major Hollywood blockbuster with an African superhero, an African-American director, a majority-black cast and a vision of a highly advanced, self-sufficient, colonialism-free African kingdom — extends to “Black Panther the Album,” a collection of songs “from and inspired by” the film. That’s a loose enough rubric to give the album’s executive producers, Kendrick Lamar and the CEO of his label, Anthony Tiffith, known as Top Dawg, the leeway to build a coherent album that juggles multiple missions.After four studio albums and many other releases, Mr. Lamar is this moment’s pre-eminent rapper: furiously inventive, thoughtful, virtuosic, self-conscious, musically adventurous and driven. “Black Panther the Album” is very nearly as densely packed — with ideas, allusions and ambitions — as one of Mr. Lamar’s official solo albums. He’s superbly abetted by his frequent collaborator Sounwave (Mark Spears), the producer or co-producer on almost every track, who shifts the atmosphere constantly — often within a single song — deploying ratchety trap percussion, menacing electronics, blurry pitch-shifted samples, and even a rock guitar.“Black Panther” does include the mandatory action-film pop anthems. In “All the Stars,” Mr. Lamar raps about conflict between hopeful choruses from SZA. But the song’s release as a single has been marred by complaints that its video clip imitates, without credit, the imagery of a Liberian-British artist, Lina Iris Viktor.Ending the album is the more grimly determined “Pray for Me,” with the Weeknd mournfully vowing to “spill this blood for you” and Mr. Lamar rapping about how “I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself” over a track that vaguely suggests African drumming and traditional ululations. Ballads, another soundtrack-album requirement, are equally burdened. The English songwriter Jorja Smith sings “I Am” over an adamantly sluggish drumbeat and a lonely guitar line, affirming a sense of duty: “When you know what you got, sacrifice ain’t that hard,” she declares.The album’s broader strategy is to hint at the movie’s story while concentrating on tales of struggle and swagger much closer to home. From the songs, it would be easy to believe the movie was set in California, although there are bits of African input tucked in.Mr. Lamar dips into the roles of both T’Challa, the African king of the fictitious Wakanda who is also the Black Panther, and Erik Killmonger, his tenacious adversary. Yet in the track “Black Panther,” which ends with the words, “I am T’Challa,” Mr. Lamar is also quite insistently “King Kendrick”: “King of the answer, king of the problem, king of the forsaken,” he raps over a nagging, dissonant loop. Later in the track, with an almost conspiratorial voice, he asks, “What do you stand for? Are you an activist?”Mr. Lamar announces “All hail King Killmonger” in “King’s Dead,” after a litany of repudiation and denial — “Not your baby, not your equal/Not the title y’all want me under” — that may sum up Killmonger’s negativity. But it also parallels Mr. Lamar’s refusal on his albums to accept oversimplified roles like spokesman or generational conscience.The album’s many guests don’t try as hard to connect with the movie. Most of them appear as California figures, flaunting fancy cars and thinking about street-level battles. “Paramedic!” is a showcase for the Sacramento group SOB X RBE, boasting about being “heavy in the streets” over plinking percussion. Ab-Soul and Anderson .Paak share “Bloody Waters,” matter-of-factly describing growing up around, and perpetuating, endless lethal gang rivalries: “It’s warfare. Is war fair? No.,” Ab-Soul raps.The album welcomes some South African rappers and singers, and there are brief glimpses of South African rhythms; its most cheerfully upbeat song, “Redemption,” features the South African singer Babes Wodumo riding the South African club beat called gqom. Mr. Lamar and Vince Staples share “Opps” with Yugen Blakrok, a South African rapper as quick and convoluted in her boasts as they are: “Crushing any system that belittles us/Antidote to every poison they administer/Switch it like time signatures,” she raps. The track, produced by Sounwave with the composer of the film’s orchestral score, Ludwig Göransson, uses a low, scowling synthesizer line, West African talking drums and a thumping beat suggesting South African house music.Another South African, Sjava, sings fervently in Zulu in “Seasons,” a slow soul vamp that makes way for raps from two Californians, Mozzy and Reason, about being trapped in a cycle of institutional racism, poverty and violence.Those aren’t problems that a song or a superhero can solve. But if “Black Panther” had wanted simple comic-book escapism, it wouldn’t have hired Mr. Lamar."
https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/14/arts/television/chris-rock-special-netflix-review.html,"In his meticulously crafted Netflix special “Tamborine,” Chris Rock says Donald J. Trump might just work out as president, then takes a moment to listen to the silence of the crowd at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. “Yeah, I said it,” he adds, in what has become something of a catchphrase for him.Wearing a simple black T-shirt and jeans, Mr. Rock, 53, made his case based not on Mr. Trump’s potential, but rather on how his disastrous tenure could lead to something better, reminding the audience that the mistakes of George W. Bush led to Barack Obama. “People overlook George Bush’s contribution to black history,” he joked.This was one of the few bits in this triumphant comeback special, posted Wednesday, that I don’t recall from his show in Durham, N.C., exactly one year ago, the opening night of his “Total Blackout” tour. Major chunks of material were the same, yet the comedy still seemed transformed.This special, his first in a decade, is more searching and confessional than his previous work, digging into the end of his marriage after 16 years. He has honed this material, beefing up jokes and cutting out fat, and his comedy has become tighter, funnier if also slicker, shifting from a story of a comic struggling with demons to one describing how he once was lost and now he’s found.Mr. Rock’s humor has long married a supremely controlled craft with an appealing sense of danger. “Yeah, I said it” lets you know he wasn’t supposed to. When he started in New York clubs in the 1980s, he closed some sets by saying: “I was in South Africa the other day. Or was it Boston?” After telling that joke on “The Arsenio Hall Show,” the host asked him if he ever worried that his jokes would upset people. Mr. Rock responded that his next target would be Johnny Carson because of a tabloid report that he had a black grandchild he did not financially support. Mr. Hall cut him off, abruptly ending the interview.Mr. Rock rocketed to fame in the next decade with virtuosic specials that were full of intellectual provocations that would probably cause more controversy today when the politics of comedy are more scrutinized. But as he got older, Mr. Rock chose his spots more carefully, calibrating his gibes when he was host of the Oscars in 2016 (though there was a backlash to one about Asian-Americans) and releasing specials infrequently.One of his few peers, Dave Chappelle, who also recently returned from a long hiatus to make a Netflix special, provides a contrast. It’s hard to imagine Mr. Rock releasing a club set after hardly any time to refine it, the way Mr. Chappelle did over New Year’s. Mr. Rock is too much of a perfectionist. And while Mr. Chappelle shows up at clubs and spends hours onstage riffing, gathering ideas through free association, Mr. Rock’s process is much more focused and linear, like his comedy.Whereas Mr. Chappelle escapes tricky territory through sweeping history lessons or literary flourishes, Mr. Rock builds forceful arguments that culminate in precise and memorable epigrams. “Pressure makes diamonds, not hugs” is the pithiest defense of bullying you will hear.Mr. Rock’s booming act has always been built for bigger rooms, but he goes smaller for this special, with the help of the comic Bo Burnham, whose artfully idiosyncratic direction emphasizes intimacy and studiously avoids cliché. The show begins with a casual shot of the back of Mr. Rock’s head while he is chatting backstage and ends abruptly. When the star drops the microphone, Mr. Burnham fades to black before we hear the familiar sound of it hitting the floor. Crisp images of the front row of the theater, juxtaposed with smoky backdrops and ghostly lighting, make the audience appear on the same level as the performer, creating unusually striking images for stand-up comedy.In filming just the first joke — “You would think that cops would occasionally shoot a white kid, just to make it look good” — Mr. Burnham shifts angles four times, but he also knows when to stop moving the camera. As Mr. Rock confesses he cheated on his wife, he goes in for the close-up and lingers.This risks heavy-handedness but displays a perceptive eye for the importance of a pivot point where the star could lose his audience. Kevin Hart, who recently confessed to cheating on his wife before announcing a tour called “Irresponsible,” might face a similar onstage moment soon.When I saw Mr. Rock play Madison Square Garden in December, he took a few glancing shots at Matt Lauer, the “Today” host who was fired over allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior, but the comic mostly avoided #MeToo as he does in the new special. Though Mr. Rock evoked the movement at one point by shifting from his mistakes with his wife to a broader question: “What is wrong with men?”Over the course of his career, mixing the voice of a preacher with that of a litigator, Mr. Rock has built up an authority skewering the foibles of the world while keeping his own offstage. This special represents a shift in that dynamic. In describing his flaws, Mr. Rock says he was hooked on pornography. There is a lot of comedy about pornography, but to hear a superstar break down how watching it made him “sexually autistic” is bracing, and may even provide grist to certain warnings against online porn.In that North Carolina show, Mr. Rock went into more detail about his affairs. That was cut from the special, leaving nothing to invite jealousy. His tone is contrite, but it also suggests he has recovered, both from porn addiction and cheating, which he says he’s done with. In an hour dense with jokes, he gets serious. “When guys cheat, we want something new,” he says, still in close-up. “But you know what happens? Your woman finds out and now she’s new. She’s never the same again. You got new but you got a bad new.”Offstage, Chris Rock is soft-spoken, thoughtful, even shy — an alter ego to the strutting superhero he becomes in his stand-up specials whose titles (“Bigger & Blacker,” “Never Scared”) telegraph swagger. In the age of Trump, he has shifted to something quieter, more humble, and yet, with the same old confidence, with lessons learned at the end.Mr. Rock does not wallow in melancholy and regret over lost love. He turns them into a great comedy special, just in time for Valentine’s Day."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/asia/flaunting-gangnam-style-trendy-area-urges-visitors-to-prance-in.html,"SEOUL, South Korea — As monuments go, this one seems puny and tasteless next to the designer glass skyscrapers and upscale fashion boutiques of the affluent Gangnam district. Yet, it occupies a spot of honor right across from Samsung’s corporate headquarters: a hastily built plywood stage decorated with black, cutout silhouettes of a rotund man who appears to be prancing like a horse.This is the first public display to honor Psy, the South Korean rapper whose viral dance video, “Gangnam Style,” put Gangnam on the lips of YouTube watchers around the world. The local government plans to open a visitor center in February that could eventually include a life-size hologram of the singer, whose real name is Park Jae-sang, performing his buffoonish dance.But Mr. Park’s success has also helped feed much grander ambitions. Already famous within Korea as the opulent stamping grounds of this nation’s nouveau riche, the district now wants to seize the “Gangnam Style” craze as a chance to win the global recognition that it believes it deserves as a center of fashion, entertainment and, self-professedly, conspicuous consumption.“Psy appeared right when we were ready to take Gangnam global,” said Shin Yeon-hee, the district’s mayor. “We already believe we are on par with Manhattan or Beverly Hills in every way.”The question is how to capitalize on Mr. Park’s video, which in the five months since it appeared has already become the first ever on YouTube to register more than a billion hits. While Korea’s heavily produced boy and girl bands and syrupy television dramas have done well in the rest of Asia, the “Korean Wave” has so far failed to make inroads in the West — until “Gangnam Style.”But many here seemed surprised by the explosive popularity of the video, perhaps because few expected the breakthrough to come from Mr. Park, a midlevel star who is as much a comedian as a singer. The district government has been left scrambling to catch up. Its 13-member tourist promotion office, created in November, first built the wooden stage at Gangnam station, the closest thing the area has to a center. Next will come the visitor center, with the holograms of Korean pop stars including, they hope, Mr. Park. (They have yet to sign a deal with the rapper.) Within a year or so, officials hope to finish Hallyu Drive, which will feature stars’ handprints in its sidewalks.The district aims to double the number of tourists from about 800,000 in 2012, most of them from China and Japan, by increasing the tiny number of visitors from the West.“Thanks to Psy, even people who don’t know South Korea now know Gangnam,” said Kim Kwang-soo, who heads the new tourism office.The officials admit this will be an uphill battle. Despite the song’s name, Gangnam itself barely appears in the video, except as a distant, high-rise-studded skyline. “We need to create a stronger connection between the song and the district,” Mr. Kim said.What Mr. Park does do in his video is parody the area’s reputation for pretentious displays of wealth. In one scene, a man in a yellow suit and oversized sunglasses saunters over to a red sports car; in another, the rapper himself prances in a tuxedo between glamorous women.Some of that flaunting of wealth is apparent in the actual Gangnam district, which sits across the broad Han River from central Seoul, the South Korean capital. (Gangnam means “south of the river.”) Corporations seem to compete for the most futuristic skyscraper, while residents drive flashy cars, party at wine bars and get their chins tucked at one of the hundreds of plastic surgery clinics.Gangnam also appears intent on recreating the sort of upper-middle-class American lifestyle seen in Hollywood movies or experienced by returning immigrants or students. The area boasts broad, Los Angeles-style boulevards (with Los Angeles-style traffic jams). Trendy restaurants offer all-day brunch and burritos. (Both are rare in most of Asia.) Seattle-style coffee shops are found not only on every block, but in every building.To hear many Koreans tell it, Gangnam’s pretensions are just an extreme form of the desires shared by most of this nation of scrappy overachievers. The district’s high-rises emerged from the rice paddies as the South Korean economy took off in the 1960s and ’70s, turning Gangnam into a symbol of the aspirations, and the excesses, of an Asian miracle that also created growing social inequalities.“It can be too flashy, but we all envy Gangnam because it is the most developed and richest place,” said Yu Jae-yung, 16, a high school student from Chuncheon, a city two hours from Seoul, who visited the Psy stage with friends on a recent frigid morning.Mr. Park, who is a Gangnam native, did not respond to requests for an interview. But other residents said “Gangnam Style” had accurately captured the split personality of an area that embraces an American-style free-spirited individualism while also trying to keep a Korean identity.Mr. Park’s song lampooned this predicament with lyrics about his preference for women who act the traditional role of demure female in the daytime, but know how to have fun at night. Residents said that while the reality is not nearly so decadent, they said they were still trying to figure out how to balance Western freedoms and traditional values.“Gangnam residents follow what they think is American on the outside,” said Jenny Tae, a 32-year-old boutique clerk who strolled down a tree-lined shopping street in tight brown corduroy pants, gold-painted nails and pink ear muffs. “But a modern, open lifestyle does not mean getting rid of everything.”That distinctly Korean flavor is one thing that the district government hopes to promote. When asked if Gangnam aspired to be like Beverly Hills, Ms. Shin, the mayor, proudly proclaimed that it no longer needed to imitate the West.“Gangnam is a uniquely Korean brand,” she said.Indeed, the handful of Western visitors who visited the Psy stage on a recent weekend in Gangnam said that they came not to see the American-style shops but to learn about the artist’s Korean origins.“That song got Americans interested in who Psy is and where he’s from,” said Jermaine Hollis, a 38-year-old American serviceman from Louisiana, who toured Gangnam by bus with his family. “The song shows Psy’s pride in his home. I can respect that.”"

Malcolm Reynolds (Nathan Fillion, left), tries to scrape together a living smuggling cargo from one fringe of the universe to the next in this film written and directed by Joss Whedon. But the crew members’ off-the-radar existence is threatened when an agent (Chiwetel Ejiofor) of an oppressive government tracks them down. Writing in The New York Times, Manohla Dargis compared this science-fiction adventure with the “Star Wars” movies by George Lucas. “Scene for scene, ‘Serenity’ is more engaging and certainly better written and acted than any of Mr. Lucas’s recent screen entertainments,” she wrote. “Mr. Whedon isn’t aiming to conquer the pop-culture universe with a branded mythology; he just wants us to hitch a ride to a galaxy far, far away and have a good time.”3 P.M. (HBO) RISE OF THE PLANET OF THE APES (2011) In this rebooted origin story for the 1968 classic “Planet of the Apes,” James Franco portrays Will Rodman, a scientist and romantic idealist who is one mistake away from becoming a latter-day Frankenstein at a big pharmaceutical company. When a lab chimp runs amok and is killed, Will takes her baby home, where his own father (John Lithgow) is living with Alzheimer’s disease. As his father’s condition worsens, Will turns him into another experiment, becoming both the son and the parent to his own two lab rats. Writing in The Times, Manohla Dargis called the movie, directed by Rupert Wyatt, “good, canny-dumb fun,” adding that it “may be primarily a calculated business decision, but it’s also a smiley wag (or flick) of the environmental finger.” Above, a scene from the film.5 P.M. (TNT) THE DARK KNIGHT (2008) In Christopher Nolan’s second Batman installment, the Joker (Heath Ledger, in the role for which he posthumously won an Oscar) terrorizes Gotham, leaving the masked crusader (Christian Bale); Commissioner Gordon (Gary Oldman); and the district attorney, Harvey Dent (Aaron Eckhart), to clean up the chaotic mess. Maggie Gyllenhaal plays Rachel Dawes, the mutual love interest of Dent and Bruce Wayne. Reviewing the film in The Times, Manohla Dargis wrote, “Pitched at the divide between art and industry, poetry and entertainment, it goes darker and deeper than any Hollywood movie of its comic-book kind.” Mr. Ledger’s Joker, she added, is “a creature of such ghastly life, and the performance is so visceral, creepy and insistently present that the characterization pulls you in almost at once.”5:45 P.M. (HBO2) DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE (1995) Bruce Willis, starring again as the down-but-never-out cop John McClane, must stop another terrorist, Simon (Jeremy Irons). This time, however, Mr. Willis cannot get to the final “yippee-ki-yay” without some help from Samuel L. Jackson as Zeus Carver. The film leads its characters (and viewers) on a dizzying tour of mid-1990s New York City, from Harlem to Central Park to Wall Street. “McClane and Zeus are plagued by fake bombs, real bombs and Simon’s cadre of killers,” Caryn James wrote in The Times, “not to mention cellular phones that suddenly go dead and really bad traffic on Ninth Avenue.”10 P.M. (HBO) THE DEBT (2011) John Madden’s remake of a 2007 Israeli thriller shuttles between East Berlin in 1965 and Tel Aviv 30 years later. Helen Mirren, right, portrays Rachel Singer, a celebrated Mossad operative who in 1965 worked with two other agency officers —Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson), who is now her ex-husband, and David Peretz (Ciaran Hinds) — to capture and kill a Nazi fugitive, Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen). Eventually the accepted account of Rachel’s actions begins to erode. Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthington play the group as young adults. “The claustrophobic, unspoken bonds and rivalries that link Rachel, David and Stephan in their younger and older incarnations are overshadowed by Vogel and everything he represents, and a finely observed study of desire under duress gives way to a breathless and pedestrian globe-trotting thriller,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “Not a bad one, it should be said.”10 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/arts/music/new-york-string-orchestra-conducted-by-jaime-laredo-at-carnegie-hall.html,"Mozart wrote several remarkable works for the Austrian clarinetist Anton Stadler, his friend and fellow Mason, including the great Quintet for Clarinet and Strings, and the Clarinet Concerto, the last major score Mozart completed, shortly before dying. He was clearly inspired by his colleague’s virtuosity and artistry. From all reports, Stadler could bend a gentle phrase with uncommon delicacy. Johann Schink, a Viennese critic, wrote that he would not have thought it possible for a clarinet to “imitate the human voice so deceptively,” as Stadler did.Schink’s words could be applied to the performance of Mozart’s Clarinet Concerto in A that Anthony McGill gave on Friday night at Carnegie Hall with the New York String Orchestra, conducted by Jaime Laredo. Besides his work as a concerto soloist and chamber music player, Mr. McGill is a principal clarinetist with the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, a job that surely enhances what has to be a natural penchant for singing tone and lyrical phrasing.In the concerto’s genial first movement and the spirited Rondo, Mr. McGill played with rhythmic brio and impeccable clarity. Yet even in passages that seem jocular on the surface, he brought out the hints of poignancy and resignation that run through the music. Mr. McGill was particularly affecting in the dreamy Adagio movement, shaping arching phrases with glowing sound and tenderness. It was like hearing a wordless mezzo-soprano in a Mozart opera. And it is always a pleasure to hear a performer who so visibly enjoys playing for people.The New York String Orchestra sensitively complemented his performance. Since 1969 this organization has brought young musicians to New York for a 10-day seminar of coaching and chamber music, with the larger goal of performing two orchestral programs at Carnegie Hall under Mr. Laredo, the project’s artistic director. This time there were 62 participants, ranging in age from 15 to 22, most of them string players, but also woodwind and brass students. The first concert was on Christmas Eve. Friday’s program was the conclusion of the 2012 seminar.The evening opened with a dark, vibrant account of “The Hebrides,” Mendelssohn’s concert overture. Mr. Laredo’s restrained tempo allowed this somber music to emerge with breadth and eerie calm. The string sound was warm and penetrating. Even the brassy, agitated outbursts came across as majestic.Cicely Parnas, a fast-rising young cellist, was the impressive soloist in a rhapsodic performance of Saint-Saëns’s Cello Concerto No. 1 in A minor, one of the composer’s most original and popular works. Running 20 minutes without a break, the piece has an impetuous opening movement, followed by a dancing, gentle Allegretto and a swirling finale. Ms. Parnas (a granddaughter of the famed cellist Leslie Parnas) brought velvety sound, articulate passagework and keen imagination to her performance, abetted all the way by Mr. Laredo and his players.The program ended with the orchestra letting loose in rousing performances of four of Dvorak’s “Slavonic Dances.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/arts/julie-klausners-podcast-how-was-your-week.html,"In 2012 I spent more time with comedy podcasts than I did with sitcoms and talk shows combined. It’s not something I would recommend to everyone.There’s only so much jokey riffing one can take. Still, the comedy podcast has become a major new medium, and not just because some performers have leveraged it into television shows and corporate deals. It’s because podcasts give comics the freedom — limitless time, no interference — to make new forms of comedy for an international audience. And that’s why “How Was Your Week?” has become one of the few essential podcasts.Its host, Julie Klausner, has performed sketch and improv. She’s worked on television, written a memoir and posted on Twitter with abandon. New York magazine recently hired her as the public face of its culture Web site Vulture, a job in which she appears in television spots and original videos. But the only vehicle that reveals the extent of her diverse talents is the freewheeling monologue that opens her hourlong or so weekly podcast.Ms. Klausner, 34, delivers around 20 minutes of topical jokes, offhand theories, an occasional song. She might speak melodramatically about her cat, Jimmy Jazz, or describe one of her various Twitter feuds with marginal cultural figures.“Pauley Perrette has blocked me on Twitter,” she said at the start of one podcast, referring to a supporting actress on “NCIS.” “This is huge. This is like Pearl Harbor. In every way.”Ms. Klausner, who lives in New York, has a brassy, old-school style. She moons over Broadway shows and the allure of an inaccessible gentile the way you rarely hear young Jews do anymore. Her literate sensibility and affection for showmanship are reminders of an era when “nerd” connoted smart more than obsessive, and it was assumed that a little song and dance would be part of an entertainer’s skill set.You can hear the influence of Joan Rivers, for whom she once wrote jokes, in her politically incorrect humor, but also Sandra Bernhard, who shares her flamboyant sarcasm and half-joking cabaret diva flair. What really distinguishes Ms. Klausner’s podcast, however, is how she turns cultural criticism of everything from reality shows to prestige movies into vivid comic performance.In previous episodes Ms. Klausner described the HBO series “The Newsroom” as a show with “the density of Gilbert and Sullivan and the confidence of a high school senior,” and “The Shining” as “a movie about a woman who married an alcoholic out of her league.” In one tangent about how “Rent” was “a little much,” she tossed off this wickedly funny line: “It’s like that guy dying young is the first thing he did that wasn’t overstaying his welcome.”“That guy” is, of course, the composer Jonathan Larson and he died the day “Rent” was to begin previews, which is exactly the kind of tedious overexplaining that Ms. Klausner doesn’t waste much time on. Her assumption that her audience gets her references contributes to the show’s knowing, personal voice, which brings to mind Moss Hart’s description of the way actors talk among themselves: “gay, sardonic and very often sprinkled with a nice edge of malice.”Ms. Klausner might be at her most irresistible when the speed of her monologue picks up, and she seems to be working out ideas out loud. As critics develop and refine opinions into reviews, their first impressions, which is often the most honest ones, can get lost or muted. That rarely happens in “How Was Your Week?” In fact, Ms. Klausner, who studied at the Upright Citizens Brigade, makes you think that criticism could learn something from improv.On the podcast she talks with many comedians but is often more interesting with journalists, artists and actors. The quality of her interviews varies wildly: Sometimes she defers to the guests too much, and she is less fearless questioning others than herself.The focus is typically more on culture than personality. Whereas Marc Maron, another comic with journalistic instincts, used his podcast to interview Tim Heidecker about his comedy, Ms. Klausner’s discussion with him focused on his thoughts on “Brand X,” the compellingly awful FX television show with Russell Brand.Ms. Klausner also writes for the addictive Fuse game show “Billy on the Street,” which shares one of her main strategies: treating the trivial with apocalyptic gravity. Its host, Billy Eichner, who often banters with Ms. Klausner on Twitter in a 21st-century double act, roams the streets of New York screaming questions about celebrities with a mighty imperiousness.But while Mr. Eichner leavens his volcanic anger with a childlike physicality — imagine an enraged, dressed-down Pee-wee Herman — Ms. Klausner packages her hyperbole in a more verbally subtle aesthetic. It’s still silly, but mostly in its use of language. In her monologue she willfully mispronounces words, adding long vowels or French pronunciations for variety. (“Twitter” becomes “Twittair.”)In one episode she says “prurient,” then pauses for a confession. “I never learned to pronounce that word, because you shouldn’t,” Ms. Klausner said, preparing for the pivot. “You should only write it in a term paper, then graduate and stop spending your parents’ money.”Ms. Klausner’s monologue has a herky-jerky rhythm. She constantly interrupts herself, asking rhetorical questions, aborting thoughts, shifting into digressions. It adds up to a goofy but assured staccato sound that is a nice match for her humor, which hits high notes in tangents and transitions. It’s a dense series of detours, woven together by creative transitions.Recently she talked about spitting on a man who slapped her near the Vatican, chatted about the Holocaust, analyzed “Rosemary’s Baby” and mocked Ricky Gervais. But all these riffs were anchored, believe it or not, by her confession that she now believes in the Devil.This oddball monologue moves from somber to superficial as quickly as it does from high to lowbrow. The jokes arrive at an unpredictable clip, and while they are hit or miss, they never seem canned. It’s personal comedy wrapped (in a way that is both apt and unlikely) inside the spirit of a variety show."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/nyregion/hurricane-sandy-and-sandy-hook-killings-distinct-but-for-a-name.html,"ORTLEY BEACH, N.J. — Stefanie Pyper’s last prehurricane memory of her house on Fourth Avenue is one of bliss: the bike ride up to the Lavallette Boardwalk, seeing a school of dolphins in the ocean, the oasis of calm amid the turmoil of raising five children ranging in age from 8 to 18.So after Hurricane Sandy devastated its ground floor, ruining everything inside, and turned the yard into a landfill — littering it with a Porta-Potty, a refrigerator, a television, pieces of the Ortley Beach Boardwalk and the rest — all she could think when she came back to begin cleaning up was that this is like being in mourning, this feels like a death.And then Hurricane Sandy gave way to Sandy Hook Elementary, where the death was all too real and the mourning was for 6- and 7-year-olds and beloved educators, not for a treasured beach house and good times with good friends.It’s not that disaster is a game of perverse one-upmanship where the greater catastrophe cancels out one not quite as awful. But, still, after that, it was hard for Ms. Pyper not to see Ortley’s disaster through the lens of the disaster in Newtown, Conn.“It put a whole different spin on life in general and on what we’re going through,” said Ms. Pyper, a former fourth-grade teacher in the Newark schools. “Of course, this is terrible, but we can take a deep breath and say this will get done. Those people are not going to see their kids again. To see what they’re going through, it humbles you.”Ortley was perhaps the hardest-hit beach town in New Jersey, with virtually all 2,400 homes damaged, about 10 percent of them destroyed. And while residents and businesses are slowly returning home in Seaside Heights to the south and Lavallette to the north, there is still no electricity, gas or water in any homes or businesses in Ortley Beach.There were deaths in Hurricane Sandy, of course — none in Ortley Beach, but more than 100 elsewhere in New Jersey, in New York and in Connecticut, including little children snatched from their mother’s arms — caused by the winds and a great storm surge.But nature’s wrath over a broad area seems at least comprehensible.Maria Muscarella spent New Year’s last year at the beach house her parents, Anthony and Raffaela Muscarella, bought in 1963.Mr. Muscarella, a Newark firefighter who lovingly built up the small bungalow year by year, expanding the first floor and adding a second in 1979, died in 1996. Maria’s brother, also named Anthony, and mother lived there year-round before the storm flooded it with five feet of water.So on Dec. 31, 2011, there was dinner at Hemingway’s Cafe in Seaside Heights with her brother and the Watsons from across the street. They all rang in the new year together and had a traditional Italian dinner the next day at the Muscarella home, a celebration of family, friendship and things that seemed eternal, like the gathering every Memorial Day to kick off the summer.They plan to rebuild, but it won’t be by Memorial Day.For now, Raffaela Muscarella, 86, is living with Maria in Maplewood, and Anthony is with a friend in Toms River.But the carnage in Newtown put their own loss in a different light.“There really isn’t any comparison,” Maria Muscarella said. “We lost things and we can replace those things. They lost children and lives. Those are irreplaceable.”On Fourth Avenue on a recent Thursday, there was not a soul around, just the wreckage, the sea breeze and the forlorn Christmas tableau at the Politis’ house — its front ripped off, showing a tattered American flag, a Christmas wreath under lifeless ceiling fans and a sad-eyed concrete angel alone on a table.But up on the main drag of Route 35, there are now traffic lights blinking orange and red. You can get sandwiches, cappuccino and cigars at the Quik Stop in Lavallette. In Seaside Heights, two of the familiar businesses, Ryan’s Deli and Steaks Unlimited, reopened the week before Christmas.At Steaks Unlimited, the area’s most famous habitués were strutting and preening their way through an episode of “Jersey Shore” on two flat-screen televisions, a dopey reminder amid devastation of the sublime appeal of everyday life in all its glory and banality. At the Jersey Shore, if not in Newtown, it still seemed within reach."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/arts/music/marva-whitney-singer-in-the-james-brown-revue-dies-at-68.html,"James Brown was Soul Brother No. 1 and, for a while, Marva Whitney was Soul Sister No. 1.That was the nickname Mr. Brown gave her when she was a singer in the James Brown Revue and a solo artist on his King Records, turning out brassy, rowdy empowerment anthems that would come to be prized by funk savants, sample-chasing hip-hop producers and record collectors.As part of the James Brown Revue, Ms. Whitney, who died on Dec. 22 at 68, had her own featured segment during its shows and sang duets with Mr. Brown, her vocals effortlessly intense. After joining the revue in 1967, she was with Mr. Brown in some of his most momentous shows during a tumultuous 1968, including performances in Vietnam for American soldiers and in Boston on the night after the assassination of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.While making her name alongside Mr. Brown, Ms. Whitney was becoming a lesser star on her own, shaped by Mr. Brown’s heavy production hand. Her breakthrough solo single was the urgent shout “Unwind Yourself,” which gained new life as the sample behind the seminal hip-hop breakbeat record “The 900 Number” by DJ Mark the 45 King.Ms. Whitney’s biggest solo hit was a response to the Isley Brothers’ “It’s Your Thing.” Her recording, “It’s My Thing (You Can’t Tell Me Who to Sock It to),” released in 1969, became the title track of her lone studio album. (It was also later sampled by Public Enemy, N.W.A. and EPMD, among other artists.)Mr. Brown had an on-the-fly but exacting recording style, and the tensions that resulted made recording the album “hell,” Ms. Whitney told the Village Voice in 2010. He also pushed her into recording more flamboyant material than she was inclined to choose on her own, and he shelved an album of jazz standards she recorded, titled “I Sing Soul.” It remains unreleased.Ms. Whitney was popular enough to land on the cover of Jet magazine, but her fame waned after she left Mr. Brown’s camp in late 1969 despite a string of singles on the T-Neck and Forte labels. In the 1980s she performed as part of the J.B. All Stars, a group of former members of Mr. Brown’s bands. At various times they included Bobby Byrd, Maceo Parker, Fred Wesley and Lyn Collins.The classic funk and soul revival of the last decade also gave Ms. Whitney new life. She released an album in 2006, “I Am What I Am,” with the Japanese funk outfit Osaka Monaurail, and played about 75 shows in the last five years. In 2009, she had a stroke onstage in Australia.Marva Ann Manning was born into a musical family on May 1, 1944, in Kansas City, Kan. She began singing professionally as part of the Manning Gospel Singers. She also sang with the gospel group the Alma Whitney Singers and a local R&B group, Tommy & the Derby’s. In 1967, after an audition with Mr. Brown’s bandleader Pee Wee Ellis, Ms. Whitney was hired. She had turned down tours with Bobby Bland, Joe Tex and Little Richard.In recent years she collaborated with Charles Waring on an autobiography, “God, the Devil & James Brown: Memoirs of a Funky Diva,” which is to be published this year.Ms. Whitney died of complications of pneumonia in her hometown, said DJ Pari, who was her manager from 2004 through her retirement last year. She is survived by her mother, Willa Mae Manning; five brothers, Ray Jr., Raymond, Melvin, Marvin and Winfred; two children, Sherry Whitney and Ellis Taylor Jr.; five grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/arts/music/golden-palominos-with-lianne-smith-and-lori-carson.html,"More an apparition than a band, the Golden Palominos have materialized, vanished and reconfigured over the past 30 years, according to the impulses of the drummer Anton Fier, the band’s only constant. The Golden Palominos have been a noise-funk band, a globally tinged pop band, a rock band and a folk-pop band, while their studio albums have featured guest lead vocalists like Michael Stipe of R.E.M. and John Lydon of Public Image Ltd.Through the years the band has evolved from avant-garde to rootsy. Lately the Golden Palominos have been backing up folky singer-songwriters, and two of them — Lianne Smith and Lori Carson — performed with the Golden Palominos on Saturday night at Le Poisson Rouge, after a superb opening set by the band Ida.Ms. Smith made her 2012 album, “Two Sides of a River,” with the Golden Palominos. Ms. Carson, who sang on two Golden Palominos albums in the 1990s, drew nearly her entire set from her 1995 album, “Where It Goes,” which was backed by Mr. Fier and the band. Until this month she and the Golden Palominos had not performed the songs onstage.“Look at the time,” she sang as the set began. “I’ve wasted all these years gone by.”The songs from “Where It Goes” were gentle and diffident, full of pretty fingerpicking and the regrets and longing surrounding a breakup. Ms. Carson’s voice — high and piping, sometimes shaky about pitch — brought even more fragility to the music, while the band was the essence of discreet support, treading extremely lightly as Ms. Carson sang plaints like “I’m feeling kind of lost and I can’t make it back.”But when they concluded with a 1994 Golden Palominos song, “Little Suicides,” the wispy, folky arrangement made way for a surging crescendo that had been lurking amid the band’s restraint.The band was less demure for Ms. Smith’s songs. Her tunes have folk and country roots, but her lyrics are full of splintered imagery and odd characters: a bareback rider, a witness to a car accident, or a Norwegian immigrant in desolate North Dakota, where “there’s worse than cold weather out on the Great Plains.”And where Ms. Carson had gotten mild-mannered, 1970s-style pop-folk, Ms. Smith got backups that roiled and seethed to the point of feedback, verging on psychedelia and then easing back before the next strategic disturbance. The Golden Palominos remained mutable.But Ida, the opening act, played the night’s most exquisite set. Ida’s songs are hushed and intricate, with high vocal harmonies: two women, one man, floating above undulating Minimalist patterns on piano or guitar, or perhaps the drone of a harmonium. They often sing about possibilities and hypotheticals, about what-ifs, and their songs have found a way to hover at the edge of the corporeal."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/world/africa/ruthless-smuggling-rings-put-rhinos-in-the-cross-hairs.html,"KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa — They definitely did not look like ordinary big-game hunters, the stream of slender young Thai women who showed up on the veld wearing tight bluejeans and sneakers.But the rhinoceros carcasses kept piling up around them, and it was only after dozens of these hulking, relatively rare animals were dead and their precious horns sawed off that an extravagant scheme came to light.The Thai women, it ends up, were not hunters at all. Many never even squeezed off a shot. Instead, they were prostitutes hired by a criminal syndicate based 6,000 miles away in Laos to exploit loopholes in big-game hunting rules and get its hands on as many rhino horns as possible — horns that are now worth more than gold.“These girls had no idea what they were doing,” said Paul O’Sullivan, a private investigator in Johannesburg who helped crack the case. “They thought they were going on safari.”The rhino horn rush has gotten so out of control that it has exploded into a worldwide criminal enterprise, drawing in a surreal cast of characters — not just Thai prostitutes, but also Irish gangsters, Vietnamese diplomats, Chinese scientists, veterinarians, copter pilots, antiques dealers and recently an American rodeo star looking for a quick buck who used Facebook to find some horns.Driven by a common belief in Asia that ground-up rhino horns can cure cancer and other ills, the trade has also been embraced by criminal syndicates that normally traffic drugs and guns, but have branched into the underground animal parts business because it is seen as “low risk, high profit,” American officials say.“Get caught smuggling a kilo of cocaine, you will receive a very significant prison sentence,” said Ed Grace, a deputy chief with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. But with a kilogram of rhino horn, he added, “you may only get a fine.”The typical rhino horn is about two feet long and 10 pounds, much of it formed from the same substance as fingernails. Yet it can fetch nearly $30,000 a pound, more than crack cocaine, and conservationists worry that this “ridiculous price,” as one wildlife manager put it, could drive rhinos into extinction.Gangs are so desperate for new sources of horn that criminals have even smashed into dozens of glass museum cases all across Europe to snatch them from exhibits.“Astonishment and rage, that’s what we felt,” said Paolo Agnelli, a manager at the Florence Museum of Natural History, after three rhino horns were stolen last year, including a very rare one from 1824.American federal agents recently staged a cross-country undercover rhino horn sting operation, called Operation Crash, “crash” being the term for a herd of rhinos.Among the 12 people arrested: Wade Steffen, a champion steer wrestler from Texas, who pleaded guilty in May to trafficking dozens of horns that he found through hunters, estate sales and Facebook; and two members of an Irish gang — the same gang suspected of breaking into the museums in Europe.In an e-mail to an undercover agent, an Irish gangster bragged: “Believe me WE NEVER LOSES A HORN TO CUSTOMS, we have so many contacts and people payed off now we can bring anything we want out of nearly any country into Europe.”Corruption is a huge element, just like in the illegal ivory trade, in which rebel groups, government armies and threadbare hunters have been wiping out tens of thousands of elephants throughout Africa, selling the tusks to sophisticated criminal networks that move them across the globe with the help of corrupt officials.Here in South Africa, home to the majority of the world’s last surviving 28,000 rhinos or so, the country is throwing just about everything it has to stop the slaughter — thousands of rangers, the national army, a new spy plane, even drones — but it is losing.The number of rhinos poached in South Africa has soared in the past five years, from 13 killed in 2007 to more than 630 in 2012. The prehistoric, battleship-gray animals are often found on their knees, bleeding to death from a gaping stump on their face.“Ever seen a dead rhino?” asked Philip Jonker, who works for a private security firm that has gone into wildlife protection. “It’s worse than going to a funeral.”The only answer, some contend, is to legalize the trade, which would flood the market with rhino horns, lower the price and dissuade rhino poachers from risking their lives — or so the argument goes. Rhino horns regenerate, and the horns can be shaved down every few years and sold off without significantly hurting the animal.One of most passionate advocates of this legalization movement is John Hume, a South African entrepreneur who now owns more than 800 rhinos, with names like Curly, Titan, Hillary and Pinocchio, and has amassed a 2,000-pound mountain of horn worth millions of dollars — if he is ever allowed to sell it.“Why shouldn’t the person who breeds rhino get a reward?” he asks.Every time Mr. Hume’s ranch hands trim down a few rhinos, they organize an armed escort to take the horns straight to a safe-deposit box in a bank because the same gangs that waylay armored bank trucks are now cruising around South Africa looking for rhino horns.But many wildlife groups say legalizing the rhino trade would be a disaster.“The consuming power in my country is growing so rapidly that the supply would never meet the needs,” said Jeff He, spokesman for the Chinese branch of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. “And besides, it’ll always be cheaper to poach an animal than raise it.”Kruger National Park, an enormous wildlife refuge in South Africa’s northeast, is where many rhinos are being poached. The park lies on the border with Mozambique, a much poorer country still scarred from years of civil war. Park rangers say Mozambican gunmen are pouring through Kruger’s chain link fences, downing rhinos left and right.Some sophisticated poaching rings use helicopters to spot the animals and veterinarians to dart them with tranquilizers. Others don women’s shoes, to leave misleading tracks. “At any one time, there are up to 10 groups operating inside the Kruger,” said Ken Maggs, a South African National Parks official. “These guys are trying new methods daily.”Scientists say that maybe a million rhinos once roamed the earth, and for some reason, humans have been fascinated with the horn for ages. The ancient Persians thought rhino horn vessels could detect poisons. The Chinese thought rhino horn powder could reduce fevers. The Yemenis prized the horn for coming-of-age daggers, presented to teenage boys as a sign of manhood.In Asia, faith in traditional cures runs strong, fueling demand as Asian economies grow, though there is no scientific proof that rhino horn can cure cancer.In 2008, a Vietnamese diplomat in South Africa’s capital, Pretoria, was caught on camera receiving rhino horn — in the parking lot of the embassy. Around the same time, a Chinese company opened a secretive rhino breeding center in Hainan Province, reportedly to produce rhino-based medicine.In the past 50 years, the overall rhino population has plummeted by more than 90 percent, despite an international ban on the trade in rhino parts since 1977.But in South Africa, it is legal to hunt rhinos, creating the loophole that the Thai prostitutes sauntered through. Hunters must agree to keep the horn set (rhinos have a large front and smaller back horn) as a trophy and not sell it, and hunters are allowed to kill only one white rhino every 12 months. (Black rhinos are critically endangered and very few are hunted in South Africa.)According to South African law enforcement officials, gang leaders in Thailand and Laos decided that to maximize the number of rhinos they could kill, they would enlist Thai prostitutes who were already in South Africa with valid passports, which were used for the hunting permits. The women then tagged along on the hunts, often dressed in catchy pinks and blues, but somebody else — usually a professional hunter — pulled the trigger.“I don’t know whose idea it was to use the ladies, but it was a damn good one,” said Mr. O’Sullivan, the private investigator.None of the two dozen or so prostitutes involved have been prosecuted — the intent was to get the big fish. So Mr. O’Sullivan leaked a photograph of an enormous stockpile of ivory and rhino horns to one of the women, along with a message for her boss, a bespectacled Thai man named Chumlong Lemtongthai, that everything was for sale: “I wanted the big man himself to come here and negotiate.”Mr. Lemtongthai did exactly that, and he was arrested soon after. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in November to 40 years.“I do not want to see a situation where my grandchildren will only be able to see rhino in a picture,” said the judge, Prince Manyathi."

Mr. Miller, 60, is a first-rank guitarist and a producer for singers including Emmylou Harris and Robert Plant. Mr. Lauderdale, 55, is primarily a singer and songwriter who has written hits for George Strait and the Dixie Chicks and made albums with the venerable Ralph Stanley and the Grateful Dead lyricist Robert Hunter. Mr. Lauderdale is the longtime host for the Americana Music Awards, where Mr. Miller leads the house band. They host an “outlaw country” satellite radio program, “The Buddy and Jim Show,” and finally got around to making a duet album, “Buddy and Jim.”They took the duet mandate seriously. “Buddy and Jim” puts two-part harmony singing at its core; through the album, in verses and choruses, Mr. Miller and Mr. Lauderdale rarely sing alone. Looking back to the Louvin Brothers and the Everly Brothers, as well as to Sam and Dave, they share close-harmony, near-parallel lines that dovetail the grain in their voices. It’s a genial male-bonding album, conscious of history but also relaxed; it’s far less metaphysical than the albums Mr. Miller makes with his wife, Julie Miller. She wrote two songs with the duo and lent them one of her own: the album’s standout, “It Hurts Me,” an old-fashioned country waltz about love gone cold.What do two honky-tonk-loving compadres sing about together? Women, of course: loving them, losing them, missing them and, well, enduring through the centuries with a “Vampire Girl,” a rockabilly rumba written by Mr. Lauderdale.Their own songs bring an easy flair to familiar forms. “They say that nothing lasts forever, honey, I’ve got news/Whoever said that never got the blues from you,” they sing in “Forever and a Day,” a weeper topped by fiddle and pedal steel guitar that was written by Mr. Lauderdale and Frank Dycus. They also pick up vintage songs from the Mississippi Sheiks, Flatt & Scruggs and Joe Tex, whose “I Want to Do Everything for You” slips some banjo plinking into the soul vamp.The songs casually traverse the South from Nashville and Memphis to New Orleans (with the Johnnie and Jack song “South in New Orleans”), as Mr. Miller’s production tucks in his sly guitar licks and adds a vintage glaze. Clocking in at 34 ½ minutes, “Buddy and Jim” doesn’t present itself as some grand statement. But the focus on harmony singing makes it more than a random crossing of career paths. Mr. Miller and Mr. Lauderdale gave themselves a professional assignment that they could handle, as pals, with aplomb. JON PARELESMAX JOHNSON TRIO“Elevated Vegetation”(FMR Records)The deep, rattling sound that Max Johnson elicits from an upright bass is more than a calling card on “Elevated Vegetation,” the compact but expressive new album by his working trio. It also serves as a center of gravity, stout and intense, with an almost palpable physical presence. But a calling card may be the natural first response, given that Mr. Johnson is in his early 20s and still establishing his foothold as an individualist and an artist as opposed to an adaptable sideman.This is Mr. Johnson’s second album, and it comes just months after his first, “Quartet,” which was released on the Polish label NotTwo Records. That debut proposed an experimental and intergenerational outing. It features the saxophonist Mark Whitecage, the trombonist Steve Swell and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey, searching improvisers with more than 40 years of age disparity among them. One track bears a dedication to Henry Grimes, the free-jazz bassist with whom Mr. Johnson has recently apprenticed.“Elevated Vegetation” is a sparser and more subtly adventurous outing, and it presents Mr. Johnson more or less within his jazz peer group, alongside the cornetist Kirk Knuffke and the drummer Ziv Ravitz. This is a crew attracted to roving abstraction but capable of tight focus and brisk concision. The album consists of nine tracks, the longest and least songlike of which is a tumbling abstraction of “Money, Money, Money,” the Abba tune.The greater portion of the album features Mr. Johnson’s compositions, which tend toward simple and durable construction. “Blue Willie,” the opener, pairs a double-stop bass ostinato with a swashbuckling drum part, in emulation of John Coltrane’s classic rhythm team. “Crackdown” has cornet and bass doubling a swinging line while Mr. Ravitz suggests a soft-shoe with brushes on his snare. “Many Celebrations” and “Kersey” employ vamps beneath melodies that draw from Middle Eastern scales.The trumpet, bass and drums trio is less of a rarity in jazz than it used to be though it’s still far from commonplace. Mr. Johnson and his partners — who will play this music and some newer material, at ShapeShifter Lab in Brooklyn on Monday — can evoke contemporary parallels, like Triveni and the Linda Oh Trio. But the Johnson trio establishes its own momentum, largely by the particularity of its components: Mr. Knuffke’s pinpoint accuracy and mellow, centered tone; Mr. Ravitz’s way of urging his cymbals and toms astir; and Mr. Johnson’s grounded but unreserved presence at the center of it all.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/01/sports/basketball/nets-with-carlesimo-break-down-against-spurs.html,"SAN ANTONIO — P. J. Carlesimo spent five happy years with the San Antonio Spurs, long enough to win three championships and gain a few insights into one of the most successful franchises of the modern era.He also learned a certain adage, one he shared last week, on his first day as the Nets’ interim coach: the Spurs, Carlesimo noted, are the sort of team that always seems to be in reach, and then suddenly is not. Opponents walk away shaking their heads, thinking they almost had them.That moment arrived much too early on Monday night. The Nets trailed by 3 points late in the first half, giving the momentary impression of a competitive game. By halftime, the margin was 8. By the end of a disastrous third quarter, it was 33.The gap between the Nets and the N.B.A. elite never looked so colossal, so unbridgeable, as it did in a 104-73 rout by the Spurs.The Nets (16-15) scored 5 points in the third quarter, a franchise record low. They made just 2 of 20 shots in the period, turned the ball over seven times and played defense with equal ineptitude.“Abominable,” said Carlesimo, who had a much better time here as a Spurs assistant than as the Nets’ interim head coach.So despite a $330 million roster overhaul, a change in ZIP codes, a new arena and a recent change in coach, the Nets closed 2012 much as they began it: looking hapless and lost.“I think we’re a little out of whack right now as a group,” Deron Williams said. “I know I am individually.”Williams was the only Net to score in the third quarter, on a jumper, a layup and a free throw, going 2 for 6 from the field while his teammates were 0 for 14. Yet he still turned in his worst game of the season, finishing with 8 points while going 3 for 11 from the field, with an assist.Afterward, Williams struck a familiar pose in the locker room, with his feet in a bucket of ice and ice packs on both knees and his chronically sore right wrist. He turned his right ankle early in the game, another seemingly nightly occurrence. When reporters dispersed, he closed his eyes and covered half of his face with his left hand.It was Williams’s signature in July that was supposed to herald a new start for this franchise. But he was as responsible as anyone for the Nets’ sickly 5-11 record in December, which included four double-digit losses in the last two weeks.“I got to play better, I got to find ways to get going,” Williams said. “Even on bad nights, I don’t play like this. It doesn’t even feel like it’s me out there on the court. I just got to snap out of it.”Williams continued: “I put a lot of pressure on myself early. I was really excited about this year. Coming into the season, I felt like we had a great team. I still feel like we have a great team. And I want to be able to help the team more and play better. Tonight is just another night I didn’t help.”Nor did he do much of anything to contain the Spurs’ Tony Parker, who diced up the Nets’ defense for 20 points and 6 assists in just 26 minutes. Tim Duncan added 15 points, outplaying Brook Lopez (11 points).The Spurs (25-8) won their sixth game in a row and handed Carlesimo his first defeat since he replaced Avery Johnson last week. Coach Gregg Popovich was able to rest all of his starters in the fourth quarter, without any fear of a fine from the commissioner’s office.The Nets played without their best defender, Gerald Wallace, who has a bruised left knee, but their problems ran much deeper.“It was tough to even watch,” said Joe Johnson, who finished with 12 points.He added, “We shot ourselves in the foot in the third quarter.” But that seemed unlikely since they clearly would have missed.The Nets have not won a game in San Antonio since January 2002, a span of 11 games, dating to the season before Carlesimo became a Spurs assistant.The night began with a kind embrace, Carlesimo meeting Popovich, his close friend and former dining partner, near midcourt. Popovich earlier admitted some feelings of awkwardness, having also served as a mentor to Avery Johnson.Reacting to Johnson’s sudden firing last week, Popovich said, “It sort of shows what a fickle, volatile business we’re in.” He declined to elaborate Monday, but when asked if 30 games were enough for new team to find its stride, Popovich did not hesitate.“It takes longer,” he said.REBOUNDSGregg Popovich offered an unusual, mostly complimentary appraisal of the Nets’ Brook Lopez. “He’s a strange one at that position,” he said before the game. “You look at him, he looks awkward. And you look again, you go, ‘Man, he’s also huge.’ And you look again, you say, ‘He’s also kind of quick, and he gets from A to B. And you look again, you say he’s competitive. He just doesn’t look like that fine-tuned, N.B.A., skilled guy that comes out of the cookie cutter. He’s just all over the place. He creates problems, because he can guard, he can score and so they got a good combination.” ... Kris Humphries returned to the rotation after missing four games to recover from a mild abdominal strain."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/movies/emmanuelle-riva-of-amour-from-new-wave-to-new-stardom.html,"PARIS — The actress Emmanuelle Riva, a symbol of the French New Wave and now an octogenarian, wasn’t giving much thought to success or even finding a lead role in a film after her last one some 20 years ago. But when the Austrian director Michael Haneke, whose work she had long admired, offered her a starring part in “Amour,” a poignant tale of love and death set in a book-filled Paris apartment, she said yes instantly.“I immediately sensed that there was something extraordinary about the script,” said Ms. Riva, 85. “I sensed it intimately, without the least vanity. I knew I could do it, I wanted to do it right away, and I lived through it with passion.”Ms. Riva’s subtle performance as a retired music teacher who falls into physical and mental decline after a stroke, putting enormous strain on her husband, played by Jean-Louis Trintignant, has been praised by critics all over the world. In The New York Times Manohla Dargis described her (and Mr. Trintignant, who is 82) as “subtly brilliant,” while The Daily Telegraph called her “astonishing” and Le Monde wrote that she was “remarkable in her strength and stubbornness.”In May Ms. Riva stood next to Mr. Haneke after the film won the Palme d’Or at the Cannes Film Festival. It was the first of many honors, including a Golden Globe nomination for foreign-language film. Ms. Riva herself has collected three prizes, from the European Film Awards, the Los Angeles Film Critics Association and the Boston Society of Film Critics — quite a run, considering that she had last won a major film award for Georges Franju’s 1962 “Thérèse.”Though much has been made of the “Amour” stars’ advanced years, in an interview at the Paris apartment where she has lived for almost 50 years, Ms. Riva did not want to talk about age, renaissance or fame; she bans words like “career” from her vocabulary. She still marvels at the most ordinary examples of life, including the pigeons that regularly stop at her window. Her home is an elaborate blend of past and present, with landscape paintings displayed among recent pictures of animals, including her cat, Titine, now dead.Ms. Riva has shorter hair than her character in the movie, but she has the same delicate reserve and softness in her eyes. She sat straight, even immobile, and moved from a room to another with an athletic grace unusual for a woman of her age.Though Ms. Riva has long been admired for her inimitable diction, allure and unassuming intelligence in portraying often dark and unconventional characters in New Wave classics like “Hiroshima Mon Amour,” she said, “I’ve never wanted to be a star, never.” She added: “I tried to do things that pleased me, and I needed to do various things. It is dreadful to see actors reproducing the same image constantly.”Mr. Haneke’s unusually tender yet unsentimental look at old age attracted her, she explained, and his straightforward view of decrepitude and death did not scare her, even when she was made up to appear older for the role.“My instructions were ‘no sentimentalism,’ ” she said. “From that moment on, I understood everything.”She threw herself into the performance with more instinct than preparation, and the role, she said, “exorcised” her fears of death. Isabelle Huppert, who plays her daughter in “Amour,” told her that in Mr. Haneke’s movies, “the spectators are the ones who suffer, not the actors,” and Ms. Riva said she agreed with that sentiment.“The atmosphere was very solemn, very precise and very rigorous on the set,” she added. “There wasn’t any sadness; we were all together.”Like many other actresses, she went through an audition for the role of Anne, the retired teacher. “Haneke told me that I was the one who had touched him the most,” she said. “He even kindly told me later that I was the only actress in France who could do it.”In an interview with The Times earlier this year, Mr. Haneke said, “As a young man, I’d been captivated by Emmanuelle Riva in ‘Hiroshima Mon Amour’ but after that I lost her from view.” When it came time to cast “Amour,” he said that at the auditions, “from the very beginning Emmanuelle Riva was my favorite, not only because she’s a great actress but because she forms a very attractive and believable couple with Jean-Louis Trintignant.”Ms. Riva was born Paulette Rivat in 1927 and grew up in Remiremont, a small village in eastern France. Her father worked as a painter for construction companies.As a child, Ms. Riva cherished “climbing on the trees of words” and performed in plays at the local theater. But life as an actress seemed unattainable for a “country girl,” as she likes to call herself, from a family of modest means, so she quit school and worked as a seamstress for several years “while waiting for something else.”After seeing an advertisement in a local paper, she applied to an acting school in Paris and landed her first role on the Paris stage in 1954, in George Bernard Shaw’s “Arms and the Man.”“I wanted to live another life and many lives at once,” she said. “Acting makes you live plenty of lives.”The celebrity she never sought came in 1959 when Alain Resnais chose her as the lead in “Hiroshima Mon Amour,” playing an actress who goes to Hiroshima after the United States has dropped the atomic bomb, and is caught in an impossible affair with a Japanese architect.She has fond memories of the experience, whose aftereffects include the 2009 publication of a book of photographs she took of Hiroshima during the shooting, and a lasting friendship with the movie’s writer, Marguerite Duras.Ms. Riva later played a tormented widow looking for God in the 1961 “Léon Morin, Priest,” by Jean-Pierre Melville, as well as an unhappy wife who tries to poison her husband in “Thérèse.” Those performances, considered audacious at the time, led to more tragic and intellectual roles rather than comedies.“I refused as many offers as I accepted,” she said. “I refused commercial roles. But it was wrong, I have been too extreme, and I don’t say it was good.”After working with renowned directors like Marco Bellochio and Philippe Garrel, Ms. Riva had difficulty finding film roles that suited her, and mostly devoted herself to theater work. She had small parts in Krzysztof Kieslowski’s “Three Colors: Blue,” from 1993, and Tonie Marshall’s 1999 “Venus Beauty Institute,” and then turned to poetry for a while, writing three books of verse.She likes to quote her friend the singer Jacques Brel, with whom she performed in André Cayatte’s “Risques du Métier” (1967): “Do you know any word more stupid than ‘star’?”Ms. Riva is childless, and her companion died in 1999. Today she lives with no cellphone or television, and says that whatever comes, she intends to remain an ordinary person, even after the attention she has received for “Amour.”The film’s success pleases her, she said, particularly when she hears from fans or young people.On a recent day her face lighted up as she read a letter from an old friend who had just seen “Amour.” “I still wonder how you managed to age so tragically in front of our eyes,” the friend wrote.Ms. Riva laughed and said, as if responding to the letter: “Anne is another person, it isn’t me. It is a journey into someone else, someone I’m not.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/arts/music/artek-an-early-music-orchestra-at-immanuel-lutheran-church.html,"No drinks were quaffed nor meals consumed during a performance by the early-music ensemble Artek on Saturday night at Immanuel Lutheran Church on the Upper East Side. Conversation ceased when music was played. Applause came almost exclusively at the end of each work. It was almost a shame — given that the performers, billed as the Artek Orchestra, went to unusual lengths to present “Mozartean Masterpieces” in a manner inspired by accounts from Mozart’s day, you almost wanted the audience to respond in kind.True, the setting was a stately sanctuary rather than a well-appointed private salon, but the orchestra was configured as an 18th-century working band. Five first violinists and four seconds flanked two fortepianos, arranged so that their players faced each other. A violist, a cellist and a bassist sat behind each violin section, with woodwinds and natural horns arrayed across the rear.In keeping with its title, the program included canonical works spanning much of Mozart’s creative life, from the 1773 motet “Exsultate, Jubilate” (K. 165) to the Symphony No. 40 in G minor of 1788. But the presentation harked back to a time before the symphony as a form had attained its exalted status; here the first three movements of the G minor opened the concert, the finale arriving some two hours later to conclude the evening.Abetted by a pitch lower than the modern standard, with A tuned to 430 cycles per second instead of 440, the symphony sounded unusually shadowy and ominous, even at the broad pace adopted by the ensemble’s director, Gwendolyn Toth. The benefit of the seating arrangement, particularly that of the lower strings, was evident in the full, rich sound the small ensemble produced.Mozart’s Concerto No. 7 in F, originally for three pianists and revised for two, was a frolicsome lark for its soloists, Ms. Toth and Dongsok Shin, who elsewhere played in the ensemble. Ms. Toth performed a modern copy of a fortepiano owned by Mozart, and Mr. Shin used a period instrument; each produced a fragile sound that made you appreciate anew the complexities of ensemble balance and the urge that spurs instrument builders to refine and innovate.In the concert aria “Ch’io mi scordi di te” (K. 505), and again in “Exsultate, Jubilate,” the soprano Sarah Chalfy sang with a clear, pealing tone; agility; and abundant spirit. Ms. Toth’s musicality and taste compensated for her instrument’s chaste dimensions in the ubiquitous Andante from the Piano Concerto No. 21 in C.That pitch could be wayward probably goes without saying when period instruments and cold, damp weather collide. Still, the performance was wholly admirable, with firm leadership from the concertmaster Cynthia Freivogel and fine contributions from the principal wind players."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/opinion/canners-work-overtime-to-earn-5-cents-a-pop.html,"Every night until dawn, after people in apartment buildings and houses put out their sorted and bagged garbage for pickup from the sidewalks, the waiting piles are quietly picked over by some 5,000 scavengers called “canners.” In the dark, they loom as silhouettes carrying giant plastic sacks to cart away countless soda cans and bottles, redeemable for 5 cents each.“It’s a beautiful thing,” explains Marcus Moore, a canner who roams his unofficial territory barely ahead of the sanitation trucks. He makes maybe $500 a month from canning — peanuts, he says, compared with the take of Gene Rice, a kind of canning jedi master who tutored him at Picture the Homeless, an organization that serves people living on the city’s edgier corners.Mr. Moore is refashioning himself as an “ecological engineer,” he says with a laugh, while warily looking out for rats attracted to the same garbage piles.Seven years ago, Ana Martinez de Luco, a Roman Catholic nun, became a canner herself in creating Sure We Can, a project for the destitute, with the help of Eugene Gadsden, a street legend as a scavenger. Sister Ana estimated that the garbage piles back then were worked by about 2,500 people, who were predominantly poor and black, often mentally ill loners. But now in the struggling economy, there are Hispanic families, Chinese couples and other newcomers who are laboring overtime in what Sister Ana says is a doubling of the volume of empties being retrieved and cashed in.This means that Sister Ana now manages a booming depot on McKibbin Street in Brooklyn that lays claim to being the city’s only nonprofit redemption center, collecting 3 1/2 cents from the industry for handling each redeemable. Cans and bottles go through by the hundreds of thousands and canners walk into the morning light with money in their pockets. This year, Sister Ana aims to turn the center into a cooperative, controlled by a board of canners empowered by pride and castoff empties that don’t belong in the garbage.   FRANCIS X. CLINES "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/technology/tech-giants-learning-the-ways-of-washington-brace-for-more-scrutiny.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation’s capital and overseas.In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans’ video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings.But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking.Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation — meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack — that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry’s main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that the chairman of the commission itself, Jon Leibowitz, will step down.The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration.“Now that the election is over, Silicon Valley companies each are thinking through their strategy for the second Obama administration,” said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official. “The F.T.C. will have a new Democratic chairman. A priority for tech companies will be to discern the new chair’s own priorities.”In early 2012, an unusual burst of lobbying by tech companies helped defeat antipiracy bills, which had been backed by the entertainment industry. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google feared that the bills would force them to police the Internet.At the end of the year, Silicon Valley also got its way when the Obama administration stood up against a proposed global treaty that would have given government authorities greater control over the Web.The key to the industry’s successes in 2012 was simple: it expanded its footprint in Washington just as Washington began to pay closer attention to how technology companies affect consumers. “Privacy and security became top-tier important policy issues in Washington in 2012,” said David A. Hoffman, director of security policy and global privacy officer at Intel.“Industry has realized it is important to be engaged,” he continued, “to make sure government stakeholders are fully informed and educated about the role that new technology plays and to make sure any action taken doesn’t unnecessarily burden the innovation economy while still protecting individual trust in new technology.”At the end of 2012, tech companies were on track to have spent record amounts on lobbying for the year. In the first three quarters, they spent close to $100 million, which meant that they were likely to surpass the $127 million they spent on lobbying in 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that tracks corporate spending. Even the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz hired a lobbyist in Washington: Adrian Fenty, a former mayor of the city.Technology executives and investors also made generous contributions in the 2012 presidential race, luring both President Obama and Mitt Romney to Northern California for fund-raisers and nudging them to speak out on issues like immigration overhaul and lower tax rates.In a blog post in November, the center said Silicon Valley’s lobbying expenditures have ballooned in recent years, even as spending by other industries has fallen.Facebook more than doubled its lobbying outlay in the year, reporting close to $2.6 million through the third quarter of 2012. Google spent more than any other company in the industry, doling out more than $13 million in the same period and more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft, which spent just over $5.6 million in the same period.Among Google’s advocates on Capitol Hill is a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari, who heads Google’s office in Washington.Google has particular reason to be engaged. It faces a wide-reaching antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, just as Microsoft did a decade ago. At issue is whether Google’s search engine results favor Google products over its rivals’.Although the agency was ready to settle that case before the holidays, without harsh remedies, late last month it shelved the inquiry and put stronger penalties back in play. A resolution is expected in January.The commission has already fined Google on a separate matter. In 2012, the company paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple’s Safari browser to track users and serve them targeted advertisements.Facebook has vastly expanded its Washington presence in recent years. It has set up a political action committee, hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties and offered tips to lawmakers in an effort to make its site indispensable to politicians seeking re-election.Facebook scored a win on Capitol Hill in late 2012 when it nudged Congress to amend a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, that had protected the privacy of Americans’ video rental records. Facebook and its partner, Netflix, the video streaming service, advocated for changes in the law so that movies watched on Netflix could be shared on Facebook. That kind of data can be valuable for behavioral advertising, a principal source of revenue for Web services like Facebook.The company also attracted increased scrutiny from the F.T.C. The agency negotiated a consent order with Facebook to settle charges that it had engaged in “unfair and deceptive practices” when changes in its settings revealed personal information that Facebook users had regarded to be private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to audits of its privacy policies for 20 years.Facebook faced renewed public outcry last month when its subsidiary, Instagram, proposed to deploy users’ pictures to serve targeted advertisements. The company has backtracked on that proposal, but the outcry, say consumer privacy advocates, is an indication of public sentiment.“Yes, the industry managed to hold off privacy legislation this year,” said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. “But if the end-of-year protests over the Facebook and Instagram changes are any indication, users will be pressing for better privacy protections in the next Congress.”Silicon Valley’s lobbying efforts are also likely to expand across the Atlantic in 2013. Both Facebook and Google have faced off with European regulators over privacy issues. Now, the European Parliament is weighing an overhaul of data protection laws that apply across the Continent.One of the proposed changes requires Web companies to ask European Union citizens for their explicit consent before collecting personal data for targeted Web advertising. Web companies vigorously oppose that and other proposals."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/arts/television/bill-pullman-keeps-his-passions-out-front.html,"If only he’d arrived a couple of centuries earlier, Bill Pullman might be considered, well, a little less odd.Instead, he lamented good-naturedly the other day, his life appears to be “a patchwork quilt of bizarre, disparate obsessions.” An actor in more than 50 films, he has a fondness for trombones, vaudeville and things agricultural — like cattle, barns, tractors and, the subject of a lot of attention lately, his orchard.“If I were born in the 1700s, I would look like a rounded man,” he said in a phone interview from his dwelling in the Hollywood Hills, with its terraced grove of more than 100 varieties of fruit-bearing plants. “Jefferson defined a home as being a house and a garden. I think I was born out of my time.”He considered for a moment. “Well, maybe the time is coming back to me.”Or maybe it’s already here. On Jan. 10 Mr. Pullman, 59, will tackle his first lead in a comedy series — and his second as commander in chief, after the 1996 film “Independence Day” — when he stars as President Dale Gilchrist in “1600 Penn” on NBC.On Jan. 17 he’ll open the Sundance Film Festival as an American diplomat who re-enters the life of his estranged daughter for her wedding in Jordan in the drama “May in the Summer,” starring Cherien Dabis, who wrote and directed it.But it’s “The Fruit Hunters,” Yung Chang’s documentary about zealots pursuing the exotic and the succulent to the ends of the earth, that was giving Mr. Pullman pause. The movie, inspired by the 2008 book by Adam Leith Gollner, will have its American premiere at the Palm Springs International Film Festival on Friday.“Who is the greatest actor in film right now?” Josh Gad, a creator and a star of “1600 Penn,” recalled being asked by an acting teacher when he was a student at Carnegie Mellon University.“And she said, ‘Bill Pullman, because he has this unbelievable ability to swing the pendulum and capture the essence of humanity in every one of his roles,’ ” he said.That humanity may be captured nowhere quite as lucidly, or as self-consciously, as in “The Fruit Hunters,” in which Mr. Pullman — gravelly voice and fathomless eyes on full display, along with a closetful of plaid shirts — holds his own among the cultivators, smugglers and epicures whose lustiest ardor seems reserved for a mouthful of flesh and juice.Here he is at a Florida auction, bidding hundreds of dollars for a plate of mangoes. There he is in Hawaii, bushwhacking through the jungle in search of ice cream bean and water apple and bilimbi.“I know Bill Pullman as a veteran Hollywood actor, but I’m not sure that acting is really his main passion,” Mr. Chang says in the voice-over.Mr. Pullman said: “I didn’t bust him on that, but people are always touching different parts of the elephant, and they think they define the elephant. Some people think I’m obsessed with working with old tractors, others see that in my free time I’m putting on these vaudevilles, and Yung gets to think that I’m obsessed about fruit.”“The thing about acting is it’s the one that lets me get immersed in the other things,” he added. “I always come back to acting.”Mr. Chang’s assumption is understandable. In 2009, as he was pondering a way to translate into film Mr. Gollner’s book — a paean to the world’s myriad, frequently awe-inspiring fruits and those who have worshiped them — he read a New York Times profile that included a tour of Mr. Pullman’s orchard.“I immediately felt this punch in the gut that perhaps fate was calling,” Mr. Chang said. “And Bill, without knowing anything about my background, invited us out to his home and asked us to stay with him for a week to find an angle in.”The film shows Mr. Pullman toiling in his orchard and later in his kitchen as he gleefully concocts white sapote ice cream: “Get ready to have a taste sensation that I know you have never had before, chez Bill.”That so much of his home — and himself — is on display has incited a bit of after-the-fact consternation.“It’s more about privacy,” Mr. Pullman said. “I don’t like this instinct of reality television to wear your lifestyle in public. I’ve really always loved the anonymity of things.”Still, he was prepared to let down his guard for the sake of the Hollywood Orchard, a nonprofit, neighborhood-centric organization he helped found in 2011 that gleans unpicked fruit from trees to be donated to food pantries or processed at pop-up cooking facilities on the street.“What is it Hemingway said?” Mr. Pullman asks in the film. “ ‘You can only love one woman and one piece of land truly in one lifetime.’ ”The woman is easy. The land is trickier. In the early 1990s, a decade after he stopped teaching theater at Montana State University, Mr. Pullman bought a ranch near Cardwell, Mont., and last summer presented a vaudeville show about the drought in a garage he’d transformed into a performance space, near a barn he’d converted into a house. It includes a suspended performance floor for his wife of 26 years, the dancer Tamara Hurwitz Pullman, with whom he has a daughter and two sons.In Hartsville, N.Y., a few miles from his hometown, Hornell, Mr. Pullman turned another barn into a community center, where he has hosted tractor square dancing, in which the machines do-si-do and promenade the way people would on foot. Banners symbolize solidarity: red for International Harvester, orange for Allis-Chalmers and green for John Deere.“It was so gonzo,” he said. “The men drove, and the women carried flags, and they looked like mighty Amazon goddesses coming in.”Not far away is the site of Mr. Pullman’s first orchard, planted when he was 13, a few years after his mother, a nurse, had her first psychiatric breakdown, and his father, a doctor, was dealing with problems of his own.An orchard meant serenity, he said. An orchard meant health.Late in “The Fruit Hunters,” Mr. Pullman shakes a branch of one of the 18 trees there, “a zone that you could create and control, when everything else was out of control,” he recalls. He picks up an apple, takes a bite and gazes heavenward.“This is good,” he says."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/world/asia/beate-gordon-feminist-heroine-in-japan-dies-at-89.html,"Beate Sirota Gordon, the daughter of Russian Jewish parents who at 22 almost single-handedly wrote women’s rights into the Constitution of modern Japan, and then kept silent about it for decades, only to become a feminist heroine there in recent years, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.The cause was pancreatic cancer, her daughter, Nicole Gordon, said.A civilian attached to Gen. Douglas MacArthur’s army of occupation after World War II, Ms. Gordon was one of the last living members of the American team that wrote Japan’s postwar Constitution.Her work — drafting language that gave women a set of legal rights pertaining to marriage, divorce, property and inheritance that they had long been without in Japan’s feudal society — had an effect on their status that endures to this day.“It set a basis for a better, a more equal society,” Carol Gluck, a professor of Japanese history at Columbia University, said Monday in a telephone interview. “By just writing those things into the Constitution — our Constitution doesn’t have any of those things — Beate Gordon intervened at a critical moment. And what kind of 22-year-old gets to write a constitution?”If Ms. Gordon, neither lawyer nor constitutional scholar, was indeed an unlikely candidate for the task, then it is vital to understand the singular confluence of forces that brought her to it:Had her father not been a concert pianist of considerable renown; had she not been so skilled at foreign languages; and had she not been desperate to find her parents, from whom she was separated during the war and whose fate she did not know for years, she never would have been thrust into her quiet, improbable role in world history.Nor would she have been apt to embark on her later career as a prominent cultural impresario, one of the first people to bring traditional Asian performing arts to audiences throughout North America — a job, pursued vigorously until she was nearly 70, that entailed travel to some of Asia’s most remote, inaccessible reaches.The daughter of Leo Sirota and the former Augustine Horenstein, Beate (pronounced bay-AH-tay) Sirota was born on Oct. 25, 1923, in Vienna, where her parents had settled.When she was 5, her father was invited to teach at the Imperial Academy of Music in Tokyo, and the family moved there for a planned six-month stay. Mr. Sirota soon became revered in Japan as a performer and teacher, and they wound up living in Tokyo for more than a decade.Beate was educated at a German school in Tokyo and, from the mid-1930s on, after the school became far too Nazified for her parents’ liking, at the American School in Japan. In 1939, shortly before her 16th birthday, she left for Mills College in Oakland, Calif. Her parents remained in Japan.In December 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, it became impossible to contact Japan. Beate had no word from her parents, and no money.She put her foreign language prowess to work: by this time, she was fluent in English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish and Russian.Obtaining permission from Mills to take examinations without having to attend classes, she took a job at a United States government listening post in San Francisco, monitoring radio broadcasts from Tokyo. She later worked in San Francisco for the United States Office of War Information, writing radio scripts urging Japan to surrender.Beate Sirota received her bachelor’s degree in modern languages from Mills in 1943 and became a United States citizen in January 1945. At war’s end, she still did not know whether her parents were alive or dead.For American civilians, travel to Japan was all but impossible. She went to Washington, where she secured a job as an interpreter on General MacArthur’s staff. Arriving in a devastated Tokyo on Christmas Eve 1945, she went immediately to her family’s house. Where it had stood was only a single charred pillar.She eventually found her parents, who had been interned in the countryside and were malnourished. She took them to Tokyo, where she nursed them while continuing her work for General MacArthur.One of MacArthur’s first priorities was drafting a constitution for postwar Japan, a top-secret assignment, begun in February 1946, that had to be finished in just seven days. As the only woman assigned to his constitutional committee, along with two dozen men, young Beate Sirota was deputized to compose the section on women’s rights.She had seen women’s lives firsthand during the 10 years she lived in Japan, and urgently wanted to improve their status.“Japanese women were historically treated like chattel; they were property to be bought and sold on a whim,” Ms. Gordon told The Dallas Morning News in 1999. “Women had no rights whatsoever.”Commandeering a jeep at the start of that week in February, she visited the libraries in Tokyo that were still standing, borrowing copies of as many different countries’ constitutions as she could. She steeped herself in them and, after seven days of little sleep, wound up drafting two articles of the proposed Japanese Constitution.One, Article 14, said in part, “All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.”The other, Article 24, gave women protections in areas including “choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters.”The new Constitution took effect in 1947; the next year, Beate Sirota married Joseph Gordon, who had been the chief interpreter for American military intelligence in postwar Japan.In the 1950s, Ms. Gordon joined the staff of the Japan Society in New York, becoming its director of performing arts. In that capacity, she introduced many Japanese artists to the West, including masters of traditional music, dance, woodblock printing and the tea ceremony.In 1970, she became director of performing arts at the Asia Society in New York. She scoured Asia for talent, bringing Balinese gamelan ensembles, Vietnamese puppeteers, Mongolian dancers and many others to stages throughout the United States and Canada. She retired in 1991 as the society’s director of performances, films and lectures.Ms. Gordon’s husband, who became a real estate developer, died last August. Besides her daughter, she is survived by a son, Geoffrey, and three grandchildren.For decades, Ms. Gordon said nothing about her role in postwar Japan, at first because the work was secret and later because she did not want her youth — and the fact that she was an American — to become ammunition for the Japanese conservatives who have long clamored for constitutional revision.But in the mid-1980s, she began to speak of it publicly. The release of her memoir, “The Only Woman in the Room,” published in Japanese in 1995 and in English two years later, made her a celebrity in Japan, where she lectured widely, appeared on television and was the subject of a stage play and a documentary film, “The Gift From Beate.”In recent years, amid renewed attacks on the Constitution by Japanese conservatives, Ms. Gordon spoke out ardently in its defense.Ms. Gordon was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, a high honor bestowed by the Japanese government, in 1998. But perhaps the greatest accolade she received came from Japanese women themselves.“They always want their picture taken with me,” Ms. Gordon told ABC News in 1999. “They always want to shake my hand. They always tell me how grateful they are.”"

He agrees, if they’ll murder someone for him. “ ‘Cassandra’s Dream,’ Woody Allen’s latest excursion to the dark side of human nature, is good enough that you may wonder why he doesn’t just stop making comedies once and for all,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. Still, “like all filmmakers, Mr. Allen steals from himself like a magpie, which wouldn’t be grounds for criticism if he were a more dedicated and careful thief,” she said. “Like many of his later films, though, ‘Cassandra’s Dream’ feels too lightly polished and often rushed, as if he had directed it with a stopwatch.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/movies/harry-carey-jr-boyish-sidekick-to-john-wayne-dies-at-91.html,"Harry Carey Jr., an actor who made his mark as a boyish sidekick to John Wayne in John Ford westerns like “She Wore a Yellow Ribbon” (1949), “Wagon Master” (1950) and “The Searchers” (1956), and later became one of the most ubiquitous character actors in American television and movie westerns, died on Thursday in Santa Barbara, Calif. He was 91.His family told Reuters he died of natural causes in a hospice.Mr. Carey was one of the last surviving members of a group known informally in Hollywood as the John Ford stock company, actors cast by that director in many of his best-known films. Besides Wayne, they included stars like Ward Bond, Henry Fonda and Victor McLaglen and dozens of lesser-knowns like Mr. Carey whose faces became as essential to the foreground of Ford’s westerns as buttes and mesas were to the background.A gangly, red-haired man who often wore the front brim of his cowboy hats turned up to keep them from overwhelming his delicate face, Mr. Carey was never a leading man. But he brought an aura of earnest decency to the cavalry officers, cattle rustlers and assorted second fiddles he portrayed.He appeared in nearly 100 movies in his 50-year career, including nonwesterns and many films by directors other than Ford. Howard Hawks cast him in his first role, in “Red River” (1948), as well as in “Gentlemen Prefer Blondes” with Marilyn Monroe (1953). On television Mr. Carey made scores of appearances in long-running western series like “Bonanza” and “Have Gun Will Travel”; and from 1955 to ’57, he portrayed Bill Burnett, the popular Triple R Ranch camp counselor in the “Spin and Marty” serials, featured on “The Mickey Mouse Club” show.But by his own account Mr. Carey’s career was stamped most indelibly by the cantankerous Ford (whom he called Uncle Jack), a lifelong friend and drinking buddy of Mr. Carey’s father, the actor Harry Carey Sr.The elder Carey, one of the great stars of the silent western, had appeared in scores of Ford films in the 1920s and ’30s and was considered a model for the honest-man-of-few-words type adopted later by Wayne.After his father’s death in 1947, Mr. Carey became, for better and worse, one of Wayne’s friends and part of Ford’s company.In his 1994 autobiography, “Company of Heroes: My Life as an Actor in the John Ford Stock Company,” Mr. Carey described Ford’s unnerving combination of generosity and cruelty in his treatment of actors. Ford was “my nemesis and my hero,” he wrote.His friendship with Wayne came with baggage, too. “I loved Duke and he loved me,” Mr. Carey said in an interview with Herb Fagen, a Wayne biographer, in “Duke, We’re Glad We Knew You” (2009). “The thing is, I don’t think he ever forgave me for being the son of Harry Carey. Harry Carey was his absolute hero.”Harry Carey Jr. was born on May 16, 1921, on his family’s ranch in Saugus, Calif. His mother, Olive Fuller Carey, was an actress. During World War II he served in the Navy and worked with Ford on films for the Navy. Survivors include his wife, the actress Marilyn Frances Fix Carey; a son, Thomas; two daughters, Melinda and Patricia; and three grandchildren.“My journey has been that of a character actor,” he wrote in his autobiography. “I’ve worked with the great and the not-so-great. But mostly I’ve worked with men and women who loved their profession, and who like me, had kids to raise and houses to pay for.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/us/feeling-dragged-through-the-mud-as-mtv-comes-to-west-virginia.html,"CHARLESTON, W.Va. — Even though it has yet to be broadcast, a reality TV series set in this corner of Appalachia has created a stir for its portrait of young people prone to fighting, swearing, careening in all-terrain vehicles and wallowing, scantily clad, in the mud.The series, “Buckwild,” will fill the MTV slot vacated by “Jersey Shore.” Like that series, the new show has aroused anger over what some consider the exploitation of broad cultural stereotypes.“It doesn’t help the lousy reputation we already have,” said Greg Samms, 31, a dishwasher on a break at the Charleston Town Center mall. “You go west of Ohio, west of Kentucky — people think we’re hillbillies.”Kent Carper, the president of the Kanawha County Commission here, said dryly, “Some folks in West Virginia wear shoes, believe it or not.”Based on a two-minute trailer that MTV has released online, Senator Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, labeled the show a “travesty” and called on MTV to cancel it. “This show plays to ugly, inaccurate stereotypes about the people of West Virginia,” Mr. Manchin wrote in a letter last month to Stephen K. Friedman, MTV’s president.He accused the show’s producers of egging on a cast between ages 19 and 24 to misbehave for the sake of ratings. “You preyed on young people, coaxed them into displaying shameful behavior — and now you are profiting from it,” Mr. Manchin wrote. “That is just wrong.”MTV declined to make Mr. Friedman available to comment, and the series is set to begin on Thursday at 10 p.m. West Virginia officials are well aware that in condemning the show they risk increasing its chances of gaining viewers.“Jersey Shore” was also attacked for perpetuating stereotypes — in its case, of Italian-Americans — when it began in 2009. Gov. Chris Christie, Republican of New Jersey, blocked a tax credit the producers sought.The show became a huge hit and a defining series for MTV. The final episode was shown on Dec. 20.The tone of “Buckwild” is set by the saucy drawl of a cast member that is heard in the trailer. “West Virginia is a place founded on freedom. For me and my friends, that means the freedom to do whatever” we want, she says, adding an expletive.The trailer cuts to shots of a young woman throwing a drink can at another’s face, a young man running nude, and a fiery explosion. There are stunts involving earthmoving equipment, body licking and necking.“I have this rule,” says one young woman in the nine-member cast. “If a guy can’t rotate my tires and change my oil at least, we’re just not going to work.”Shain, a former prom king whose jobs have included collecting garbage, angles for a date by asking, “Cara, you ever been mudding?”(“Mudding,” which features prominently in the show, involves splashing in vehicles along backwoods roads, sometimes tossing a passenger into the slop.)To its creators, the show is a good-natured romp by exuberant young people. “The show lets them do their thing, which is wild and awesomely crazy at times, but it’s also got a lot of heart,” said John Stevens, an executive producer. He said that he had no intention of maligning West Virginia, and that the show was set there by happenstance. “They’re just a lovable group of kids we found,” he said.But here in the state capital, and in Sissonville, a rural community 15 miles north where the show is mainly set, the mood was critical.Ashley Somerville, 18, a senior at Sissonville High School, said none of her female friends liked what they had seen so far. Seated at lunch with her boyfriend at Tudor’s Biscuit World on Sissonville’s main road, which is lined with fast-food outlets and dollar stores, Ms. Somerville said, “That’s not how girls act.”The “reality” of the series is open to question. Melissa Whitman, who lives with her family across the street from a house that MTV rented for several of the women in the cast, said she observed careful staging of scenes. For a scene in which a neighbor complains about a noisy party, Ms. Whitman said, “I saw one of the crew talk to the lady, tell her exactly what they wanted her to do, then they filmed it over and over until they got it exactly the way they wanted.”The Kanawha County prosecutor’s office has a more serious concern. It is investigating whether producers gave alcohol to under-age cast members, a misdemeanor punishable by up to 10 days in jail.Cast members in the trailer and in other clips are perpetually gripping cans and plastic cups, though what they are sipping is hard to discern. Some were under 21 when the series was shot last spring and summer.Mark Plants, the county prosecutor, acknowledged that in the past six years his only investigations for providing alcohol to minors followed drunken-driving fatalities.“This case is obviously unique because you do have people from New York or Hollywood coming in,” he said. “And it does make it worse because they were in fact filming the conduct.”An MTV spokesman, Jake Urbanski, said the network had a policy against providing alcohol to cast members of its shows. Mr. Stevens, the producer, said that no alcohol was offered during the making of “Buckwild.” The production spent about $1 million in West Virginia, he added, and employed nearly 200 local people.One cast member, Ashley Witt, 20, said she and the others had been told not to speak with the news media. “I’m not allowed to make comments on anything,” she said.But her mother, Violet Meadows, opened the door of the small home on a steep slope in Sissonville where Ms. Witt grew up before recently moving away.Ms. Meadows said people she did not know had attacked her on Facebook as a poor parent. Her daughter, she said, “is a wonderful young person,” and “Buckwild” accurately depicts how she and her friends blow off steam.“The kids in this area, they’re from the country, they go mudding, they build bonfires, they hunt, they swim in the river,” she said.She accused Mr. Manchin and others critical of the series of having misplaced priorities. “We have kids going hungry and being abused,” she said. “Our country has so many other things to worry about than Manchin focusing on these kids playing in the mud.”Others said West Virginia’s image had little to fear from the show.“I’m not paranoid about how we look,” said Chuck Smith, 62, an accountant in Charleston. “It’s probably no more real than anything else” billed as a reality show."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/business/media/save-the-children-uses-onerepublic-in-child-mortality-campaign.html,"SAVE THE CHILDREN has enlisted the rock group OneRepublic to write a song that incorporates the actual heartbeats of young people and serves as the centerpiece of a public service advertising campaign.Meant to gain financial and political support for the organization’s efforts to reduce child mortality, the campaign — called “Every Beat Matters” — was created by the New York office of the BBDO ad agency, part of the Omnicom Group, for Save the Children and the Advertising Council. OneRepublic’s song, called “Feel Again,” was released in August on iTunes and will be featured on the group’s album, “Native,” to be released in March.The campaign is BBDO’s second for Save the Children, based in Westport, Conn., and the Ad Council; its first was introduced in 2010. Both campaigns were created to support the newborn and child survival efforts, primarily overseas, of Save the Children. According to Unicef data, about seven million children a year die before their fifth birthday, mostly from preventable and treatable causes like pneumonia, diarrhea and neonatal complications. Newborns account for 40 percent of those deaths.David Lubars, chairman and chief creative officer of BBDO North America, said that when the agency began working with Save the Children, it decided to use the organization’s “unheralded” health workers to illustrate its aid efforts. The first campaign depicted actual workers in Ethiopia and Bangladesh, walking to work in rural villages and examining children.The new campaign came about, Mr. Lubars said, when BBDO discovered a new type of stethoscope that lets the user listen to and record a patient’s heartbeat. It hired the documentary makers Sean and Andrea Fine, who have worked in Uganda and India, to film a local health worker, trained by Save the Children, in a rural village in Malawi.The Fines’s 90-second television spot opens with the health worker, Chisomo Boxer, preparing for work and waiting on his bicycle on a dirt road. It then shows an airplane flying over rural Africa, carrying a box that is unloaded from the plane and delivered to Mr. Boxer. He enters the village, surrounded by children, and opens the box, which contains a special stethoscope. He uses it to listen to and record the children’s heartbeats and to assess their health.The second half of the spot shows the Denver recording studio of OneRepublic. The group’s lead singer, Ryan Tedder, plugs a cable into the stethoscope, listens to the heartbeats of the children from Malawi and composes a song incorporating them. OneRepublic is then shown recording the song.The ad concludes with Mr. Boxer riding his bicycle in Malawi with the stethoscope strapped to it, the village children running behind him. “Feel Again” is played, and a voice-over says: “This song was created with heartbeats of children in need. Find out how it can help front-line health workers bring hope to millions of children at EveryBeatMatters.org,” a Web site that BBDO created for the campaign.BBDO also designed three print ads, each a “heartbeat portrait” of a different aid worker, one of whom is Mr. Boxer. Each portrait is made up of dozens of real electrocardiogram images; the name of each child whose electrocardiogram is shown is printed in tiny type to the left of the image.The copy on Mr. Boxer’s ad says: “Actual heartbeats from the children Chisomo saved in Malawi created this portrait of him. Help front-line health workers like Chisomo bring hope to millions of children at EveryBeatMatters.org.”The campaign also includes Web banners that employ Mr. Boxer’s “heartbeat portrait,” radio spots featuring Mr. Tedder, outdoor ads and Facebook and Twitter initiatives encouraging people to download OneRepublic’s song.In addition, BBDO created an interactive kiosk that lets users plug their headphones into stethoscopes to listen to a child’s heartbeat, “Feel Again” and a message from Mr. Tedder. The kiosk was on display last month at the One Club in New York, and the Ad Council is arranging new sites for it this year.Mr. Tedder said all the proceeds — both to the band and to its record label, Interscope — from the first 750,000 downloads of the song on iTunes would go to Save the Children. According to Peggy Conlon, president and chief executive of the Ad Council, the song has been downloaded more than 600,000 times so far.Mr. Tedder, who has a young son, went to Guatemala after he wrote “Feel Again” to see firsthand how children lived there. “In many cases, the only thing that keeps these kids alive is these front-line health workers trained by Save the Children,” he said.The campaign’s Web site was introduced in August, and the Ad Council began distributing its ads in September. “The goal of the campaign is to create awareness and raise money,” Mr. Lubars, the BBDO North America chairman, said. “We wanted to make it very personal, not negative, uplifting.”Ms. Conlon said the intended audience for the campaign was “people who care about international childhood mortality, who are likely to be more involved with charitable work.” She added that it was the first time the Ad Council had relied heavily on the contributions of a pop music group in the creation of a campaign.Mary Beth Powers, chief of Save the Children’s newborn and child survival campaign, said Mr. Tedder’s involvement “certainly brings new, younger audiences to the issue of child survival.”She also said Save the Children hoped the new campaign would inspire Americans to tell elected officials that “they can’t balance the budget” — which has in the past contained financing for foreign aid programs — “on the backs of women and children globally.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/arts/music/patti-page-singer-dies-at-85.html,"Patti Page, the apple-cheeked, honey-voiced alto whose sentimental, soothing, sometimes silly hits like “Tennessee Waltz,” “Old Cape Cod” and “(How Much Is) That Doggie in the Window” made her one of the most successful pop singers of the 1950s, died on Tuesday in Encinitas, Calif. She was 85.Her death was confirmed by Seacrest Village Retirement Communities, where she lived.Ms. Page had briefly been a singer with Benny Goodman when she emerged at the end of the big band era, just after World War II, into a cultural atmosphere in which pop music was not expected to be challenging. Critics assailed her style as plastic, placid, bland and antiseptic, but those opinions were not shared by millions of record buyers. As Jon Pareles wrote in The New York Times in 1997, “For her fans, beauty and comfort were one and the same.”“Doggie in the Window,” a perky 1952 novelty number written by Bob Merrill and Ingrid Reuterskiöld, featured repeated barking sounds and could claim no more sophisticated a lyric than “I must take a trip to California.” It is often cited as an example of what was wrong with pop music in the early ’50s, a perceived weakness that opened the door for rock ’n’ roll. But if that is true, and if the silky voice of “the singing rage, Miss Patti Page,” as she was introduced during her heyday, was mechanical or sterile, she had significant achievements nonetheless.“Tennessee Waltz,” from 1950, sold 10 million copies and is largely considered the first true crossover hit; it spent months on the pop, country and rhythm-and-blues charts.Ms. Page was believed to be the first singer to overdub herself, long before technology made that method common. Mitch Miller, a producer for Mercury Records, had her do it first on “Confess,” in 1948, when there were no backup singers because of a strike.The height of her career predated the Grammy Awards, which were created in 1959, but she finally won her first and only Grammy in 1999 for “Live at Carnegie Hall,” a recording of a 1997 concert celebrating her 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career was also the basis of recent, short-lived Off Broadway musical, “Flipside: The Patti Page Story.”In the early days of television Ms. Page hosted several brief network series, including “Scott Music Hall” (1952), a 15-minute NBC show that followed the evening news two nights a week, and “The Big Record,” which ran one season, 1957-58, on CBS. “The Patti Page Show” was an NBC summer fill-in series in 1956.Ms. Page defended her demure, unpretentious style as appropriate for its time. “It was right after the war,” she told The Advocate of Baton Rouge, La., in 2002, “and people were waiting to just settle down and take a deep breath and relax.”She was born Clara Ann Fowler on Nov. 8, 1927, in Claremore, Okla., a small town near Tulsa, one of 11 children of a railroad laborer.Having shown talent as an artist, Clara took a job in the art department of the Tulsa radio station KTUL, but an executive there had heard her sing and soon asked her to take over a short country-music show called “Meet Patti Page” (Time magazine called it “a hillbilly affair”), sponsored by Page Milk. She adopted the fictional character’s name and kept it.The newly named Ms. Page broke away from her radio career to tour with Jimmy Joy’s band and was shortly signed by Mercury Records. She had her first hit, “With My Eyes Wide Open, I’m Dreaming,” in 1950. Other notable recordings were “Cross Over the Bridge,” “Mockin’ Bird Hill,” “Allegheny Moon” and her last hit, “Hush ... Hush, Sweet Charlotte,” which she recorded as the theme for the Bette Davis movie of the same name. That song was nominated for an Oscar, and Ms. Page sang it on the 1965 Academy Awards telecast.Ms. Page briefly pursued a movie career in her early 30s, playing an evangelical singer alongside Burt Lancaster and Jean Simmons in “Elmer Gantry” (1960), David Janssen’s love interest in the comic-strip-inspired “Dondi” (1961) and a suburban wife in the comedy “Boys’ Night Out” (1962), with Kim Novak and James Garner. She had one of her earliest acting roles in 1957 on an episode of “The United States Steel Hour.”In later decades her star faded, but she continued to sing professionally throughout her 70s. Early in the 21st century she was performing in about 40 to 50 concerts a year. In 2002 and 2003 she released an album of children’s songs, a new “best of” collection and a Christmas album.Ms. Page married Charles O’Curran, a Hollywood choreographer, in 1956.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/football/ray-lewis-ferocious-face-of-ravens-and-nfl-is-retiring.html,"Next football season, Ray Lewis will be on the sideline, perhaps saving up his pregame speeches — motivational, to be sure, but sometimes indecipherable in their ferocity — for his son’s first season at the University of Miami.It is almost impossible to imagine the N.F.L. without Lewis, without the eyeblack streaked across his face, without his wild dances as he emerged from the stadium tunnel, without his punishing hits.In truth, Lewis’s play has been ebbing for a few years, his ability to run sideline to sideline slowed by age, his intimidating tackles weakened by the loss of weight he shed to try to regain some speed. Even when he tore his triceps this season and missed the final 10 games of the regular season, it was clear that the Baltimore Ravens more desperately missed a teammate, linebacker Terrell Suggs, who was out part of the season with an Achilles’ tear.But when Lewis announced Wednesday that he would retire after this season — the Ravens play the Indianapolis Colts in a wild-card game Sunday — it felt like the end of an era, one that Lewis dominated as the greatest linebacker of his generation and perhaps the greatest middle linebacker in N.F.L. history. He said it was “time to create a new legacy.”“I talked to my team today,” Lewis said to reporters. “I talked to them about life in general. And everything that starts has an end. For me, today, I told my team that this will be my last ride.”Lewis will play Sunday for the first time since he tore his triceps in mid-October. Because the Ravens are the fourth seed, the game is likely to be his last one in Baltimore, the city where he has spent his entire N.F.L. career.Lewis joined the team in 1996 as a first-round draft pick — though not the first linebacker taken that year — out of Miami, the same year the Ravens started playing in Baltimore after Art Modell moved the franchise from Cleveland.Lewis brought immediate attention and relevance to the Ravens. In 2000, a year after he was indicted on murder charges after a fight broke out at a Super Bowl party — he later pleaded guilty to a lesser charge and served no time in prison — Lewis was the league’s defensive player of the year for the first of two times and the most valuable player of the Super Bowl, which the Ravens won.Lewis also crafted a defensive legacy that still defines and shapes the perception of the team. In 2000, Baltimore gave up the fewest points in a 16-game season, allowing it to overcome a five-game stretch in which the offense did not score a touchdown. In 12 of his 17 seasons, the defense finished the season ranked in the top 10.“I thought, shoot, the guy could play forever and would play forever,” said Colts Coach Chuck Pagano, who was the Ravens’ defensive coordinator last year. “Great person, great man, great player, just an unbelievable human being — what he’s done for that organization, that city and, for that matter, so many people. He’s obviously a first-ballot Hall of Famer and will be sorely missed.”If the timing of Lewis’s announcement was a surprise, the substance was not. He has hinted that his career was nearing its end and that he wanted to be home to see his son, Ray III, play in the fall at Miami.“God is calling,” Lewis said. “My children have made the ultimate sacrifice for their father for 17 years. I don’t want to see them do that no more. I’ve done what I wanted to do in this business, and now it’s my turn to give them something back.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/arts/design/trisha-donnelly-in-momas-artists-choice-series.html,"The Museum of Modern Art’s Artist’s Choice exhibitions rarely disappoint. There have been nine such shows since the series was initiated in 1989, each with its own flashes of imagination, excavations of neglected artworks and subversions of the curatorial status quo.Past perpetrators have included Scott Burton, the first to be invited, who ruffled feathers by separating several of the museum’s Brancusi sculptures from their bases and presenting all elements as independent artworks. In 1995 Elizabeth Murray mustered an impressive exhibition of art exclusively by women. And in 2008 Vik Muniz created what he called a rebus with a linear sequence of carefully linked works that included morsels like Josiah Wedgwood’s 1768 black basalt coffee cup, one of the most elegant drinking vessels of all time.Now the torch has been passed to Trisha Donnelly, an admired Conceptual and performance artist known for her poetic if sometimes hermetic ways with mediums like drawing, photography, video, film and sound art. Working with Laura Hoptman, a curator, and Cara Manes, a collection specialist in the museum’s department of painting and sculpture, Ms. Donnelly has done the Artist’s Choice tradition proud.For one thing, she has pushed even harder than most of her predecessors at the boundaries among the museum’s medium-based departments. In addition, for the first time, the Artist’s Choice show has been inserted into what may be the Modern’s very heart: its vaunted painting and sculpture collection galleries. Also for the first time, it consists of three galleries that are not contiguous; they are to be found in the far-flung corners of the fourth and fifth floors, which house the painting and sculpture collection.The clusters of work that Ms. Donnelly has chosen ambush us, quietly but incisively disrupting the still largely chronological, mostly canonical, movement-by-movement account of modernism put forth in these galleries. Greatly favoring drawings, prints, photographs and several forms of design over traditional painting and sculpture, her arrangements draw you in, charm and mesmerize, while raising questions about what is art, who is an artist and what constitutes greatness or genius.The first display — in Gallery 4 on the fifth floor — is a solo show devoted to a photographer, and not one of the medium’s anointed gods like Eugène Atget or Walker Evans. Its subject is Eliot Porter (1901-90), brother of the painter Fairfield Porter, who devoted much of his career to figuring out how to take extraordinarily beautiful and precise photographs of birds in the wild. His images often appeared in National Geographic and tended, as the wall text says, “to be relegated to the genre of nature photography.”The 28 photographs here form a calm, concentrated oasis centering on a single vision, in notable contrast to the displays of larger works by various artists in the adjacent galleries. The images are spellbinding: small, exquisite and mostly in color of an unusually subtle kind, due to the complex dye transfer process Porter used. They have an amazing clarity of detail.The birds, their markings, their nests, the plants in which they build them, their frazzled, frantically hungry offspring, all seem vividly present. Ideas about the genius of nature (even more than of art), the alien strangeness of birds, the familiar rituals and bonds of parenthood ricochet through the gallery. Its surprisingly intense mood is summed up by Porter’s assertion in a wall label: “Before all else, a work of art is the creation of love. Love for the subject first and the medium second.”The second gallery of Ms. Donnelly’s show (Gallery 11, fifth floor) is a kind of delirious, cross-generational, multimedia meditation on artistic vision and striving, with nary a canonical artist or masterpiece in sight. Drawings and prints and photographs ring the walls, hung cheek by jowl. Punctuated by occasional paintings and sculptures, the totality of 55 works by 40 artists ranges over more than 100 years. Landscapes, portraits, the figure and the face mingle with abstract works.Eccentrics, lesser knowns and unknowns prevail here, along with unfamiliar works by better-known artists. Odilon Redon is represented by two early landscape paintings on paper that surprise by conjuring Balthus and the young Dalí. Berenice Abbott (1898-1991), known for her sympathetic portraits, is represented by six little-known abstract “Wave Pattern” photograms (1958-61), made using water, glass and lights.In a text panel Ms. Donnelly states that she considers each selection “an epic entity,” an outsize phrase that seems to emphasize that any successful artwork, no matter how slight or seemingly delicate, requires relentless personal conviction. Gossamer textures are the norm and once more invite close looking, whether in James McNeill Whistler’s misty 1878 lithograph of the Thames or Jacques Villon’s 1920 etching of the stark terra-cotta portrait head of Baudelaire by his brother Raymond Duchamp-Villon (1876-1918), an image whose fine parallel lines almost seem computer generated. The same might also be said of “Pomegranate,” a tightly wound jewel-like painting from 1957-59 by Pamela Bianco (1906-1994), a British-born American artist who is one of the show’s finds.“Dunes” (1935), by Augustus Vincent Tack (1870-1949) — an idiosyncratic portrait painter who also produced nature-based abstraction — has a visionary vibe, as does “No!,” a large 1981 painting of a staring head by Gino De Dominicis. “Shoes, Shoes, Shoes,” a 1966 sculpture by Joe Goode consisting of a segment of funkily carpeted wood staircase, all but invites ascension to “The First Step,” a starry abstraction from 1910-13 by Frantizek Kupka.The other three-dimensional objects here include sculptures by Isamu Noguchi and Edward Higgins and a swank convertible couch from 1971 by Alessandro Becchi that, exhibited unfolded, resembles a life raft. Michael Lax’s 1980 air ionizer, a tiny black plastic pyramid, also from the design collection, sits on a pedestal, but is plugged in. Put your hand near it and you will feel it altering the atmosphere, as all art should.In the final portion (Gallery 22, fourth floor) Ms. Donnelly largely forsakes traditional art for design, with the exception of a few photographs; Giorgio de Chirico’s 1921 drawing of Euripides with extravagantly crossed, unseeing eyes; and “The Fourth Dimension,” a small planet-studded painting about death as liberation by Patrick J. Sullivan (1894-1967), a folk artist, that was last exhibited at the museum in 1943. This display also includes a small, elegantly misshaped bowl by the great American potter George Ohr, a pear-wood side table by the French Art Nouveau designer Hector Guimard, a pair of amazingly au courant Polaroid sunglasses from 1946 and a streamlined wheelchair from 1986 by the Swiss designer Rainer Küschall. These finally made it clear that, consistent with Ms. Donnelly’s interest in performance, all the objects in her show evoke the human body or are used by it.But the dominant works here are 11 large, colorful, intricately patterned prints that bring to mind checked or plaid textiles, abstract paintings and, in one circular instance, the Maya calendar. Most are computer-generated diagrams of integrated circuitry from the mid-1980s designed by Xerox, Texas Instruments, the Intel Corporation and Sam Lucente, who later became vice president for design at Hewlett-Packard.Also included is the oldest item in the Modern’s collection, a small circular Coptic tapestry from the seventh or eighth century, embroidered with a cartoonish, eerily modern face. On view for the first time, it serves as an ancient ancestor to the printed diagrams.Someone told me that at the news conference for the show Ms. Donnelly said that one reason she chose the tapestry was the name of the donor: Lillie P. Bliss, one of the museum’s founders. Emphasis on Bliss, a good word for this eccentric, joyful, finely wrought excursion."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/football/nfl-roundup.html,"The Jets will hold their season-ending news conference with Coach Rex Ryan and their owner, Woody Johnson, on Tuesday — nine days after the end of their season.Much has happened since Ryan last spoke, on Sunday after a 28-9 defeat at Buffalo that secured a 6-10 record for a team that spoke of 16-0 perfection. The Jets fired their general manager, Mike Tannenbaum, but have maintained silence about the status of their embattled offensive coordinator, Tony Sparano. Also continuing is the search for Tannenbaum’s replacement, who will inherit both a coach and a quarterback, Mark Sanchez, he might not want but will probably have little choice but to retain.The Jets have been lampooned for demonstrating a lack of accountability since Tannenbaum’s dismissal. The revelation that Ryan is recharging for a few days in the Bahamas has only fed that perception.Only players available in a one-hour period of locker-room access Monday could speak to the chaos surrounding the team. Many did, with running back Joe McKnight saying, “It kind of messed with us a little bit.”By delaying Ryan’s and Johnson’s availability until Tuesday, the Jets are violating N.F.L. policy, which requires every team to conduct a news conference during the week after the season “with its head coach, and/or owner, and/or club president and/or general manager” to “respond to fan interest.” None of the other 19 teams that failed to make the playoffs violated the policy, according to the N.F.L. spokesman Greg Aiello, who said the league was investigating the matter.THE CARDINALS’ SEARCH The Arizona Cardinals have completed an extensive interview that spread over two days with their defensive coordinator, Ray Horton, in the search for a replacement for the team’s fired coach, Ken Whisenhunt.Next up is Andy Reid, the longtime Philadelphia Eagles coach, who was among seven N.F.L. head coaches who were fired on Monday. Reid’s interview, while not formally scheduled, could come on Thursday.Michael Bidwill, the Cardinals’ president, has identified Horton, Reid and Mike McCoy, the Denver Broncos’ offensive coordinator, as candidates to replace Whisenhunt, who was dismissed after six seasons. The Cardinals plan to interview McCoy in Denver this weekend.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/movies/awardsseason/writers-rethink-words-for-the-big-screen.html,"Any writer knows the sinking feeling: This line, this draft, this entire project, is not quite working. Time to face that frustratingly blank page again. Revisions are not any easier when the starting point involves someone else’s words.David O. Russell wrote 20 drafts of the screenplay for “Silver Linings Playbook,” based on a novel by Matthew Quick. Ol Parker did 43, for four directors, before “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel” was done. Tony Kushner’s first pass at “Lincoln,” based on Doris Kearns Goodwin’s “Team of Rivals” and other sources, was 500 pages long.Lucy Alibar, who adapted “Beasts of the Southern Wild” with its director, Benh Zeitlin, from her own one-act play, found that her highly personal material needed to be rethought almost entirely for the screen. Chris Terrio spent a year researching the facts behind “Argo,” then worried that he was straying too far into fiction.Here these writers, all hopefuls for the best adapted screenplay Oscar — alongside contenders like Stephen Chbosky for “The Perks of Being a Wallflower,” David Magee for “Life of Pi” and Ben Lewin for “The Sessions” — share details about their process, inspiration and doggedness to get every word just right.Lucy AlibarMs. Alibar’s one-act play “Juicy and Delicious,” performed for a few weeks in TriBeCa in 2007, was based on her relationship with her father, a small-town defense lawyer who got paid in livestock as often as cash. To make the play into a film she first had to learn how to construct a screenplay; Mr. Zeitlin lent her his college film syllabus. During their stint at the Sundance Labs they further winnowed the story, about a child and her dying father in a mystical bayou community. At first, Ms. Alibar said, “there were like five movies in there.”But much of what Ms. Alibar wrote had to be retailored for the cast, especially the star, Quvenzhané Wallis, who was 6 when filming began. The protagonist of the play was a little boy; the monologues became voice-overs, recorded when Ms. Wallis was 8.“I was really concerned that some of the text might be elevated or theatrical,” said Ms. Alibar, who spent time on the Louisiana set with Ms. Wallis. “But she nailed it.”Back home in New York, Ms. Alibar wrote the voice-over sections, mindful of both Mr. Zeitlin’s instructions and her young star’s voice and personality. Ms. Wallis has “this wonderful way of talking about things that’s a little bit metaphorical,” Ms. Alibar said. “I knew there was a lot I could get away with.”Chris TerrioIn dramatizing “Argo” Mr. Terrio had a wealth of source material: not only a 2007 Wired article by Joshuah Bearman that recounted the Hollywood-style rescue of Americans from 1970s Iran, but also the autobiography of the Central Intelligence Agency officer who directed the mission, Tony Mendez. Mr. Mendez, now retired, introduced Mr. Terrio around the C.I.A. campus in Langley, Va., which helped set the tone for the script.“How banal it seems,” Mr. Terrio said. “It looks like any community college anywhere in the world. I think that informs ‘Argo.’ “But keeping the script grounded in reality also made plotting a challenge. “You’re trying to establish an espionage thriller,” he said. “But you’re not showing some evil madman with a missile in his hangar. You’re trying to do it through words and people arguing.”If the first act of the movie, setting up the personalities and political drama, asked a lot of the audience, the final act was even tougher, especially since the outcome was well known.“I spent months pulling my hair out about the ending,” Mr. Terrio said, fretting that the real-life people whose lives the film chronicled would find it false. “I was reading things like ‘The Defense of Poesy,’ ” the 16th-century text arguing for the power of fiction, he said.In the end Mr. Terrio and Ben Affleck, the director and star, decided it was fine to use a little creative license. “We could really use every technique available in cinema, which is sight and sound and tension and the ringing phone and the wheels of the car, to really get under the skin of the audience, to say that you should doubt what you know about what happened,” Mr. Terrio said.David O. RussellThe emotional instability at the heart of “Silver Linings Playbook” had an instant, personal appeal for David O. Russell, because his teenage son has some of the same behavioral issues that Mr. Quick explored in “Silver Linings,” his 2008 debut novel. Mr. Russell, who was also directing, wanted to make a film that reflected his experience, in its difficult and hopeful moments.After “The Fighter,” the 2010 Boston boxing drama that earned him an Oscar nomination for directing, Mr. Russell also discovered he had an affinity for big family stories set in rowdy neighborhoods. “That’s as enchanting to me as the story,” he said, adding that he wanted to see the way his characters “live, the way they eat, the way they cook.”He wrote the part of the father with his friend Robert De Niro in mind, and Mr. De Niro lobbied for Bradley Cooper, with whom he starred in “Limitless,” to play his son. “They were very comfortable and close to each other” already, Mr. Russell said. That Mr. Cooper is from Philadelphia, where the movie is set, was another bonus.“The fact that we had Italian food cooking in the house that smelled like my mother’s house, and Bradley’s mother’s house, was everything,” Mr. Russell said.He also gave his son a small part, as a neighbor who wants to make a video about Mr. Cooper’s character.“He had to earn the privilege of doing it, by doing well at school,” Mr. Russell said with pride.Ol ParkerHired by the producer Graham Broadbent to adapt Deborah Moggach’s novel “These Foolish Things,” Mr. Parker spent three and a half years revising “The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel,” a process he called “a nightmare that I hope to never repeat.”The parade of directors each wanted something different, he said. “Can they take a journey, like in ‘City Slickers’?” one asked. Another version called for the story, about a retirees’ hotel in India, to skew younger — “Emma Thompson and Pierce Brosnan, hanging on a beach in Goa and taking drugs,” Mr. Parker said. By the time John Madden (“Shakespeare in Love”) came on to direct, Mr. Parker had had it. “I was like, I’m done, I hate the film, I’m written out,” he said. “John, in his ruthlessly polite way, wouldn’t let me quit.”Instead Mr. Parker spent months on the set in India, writing dialogue specifically for the cast. “Bill Nighy has an idiosyncratic delivery,” he said. With Maggie Smith “you think you’re having a touching moment, and she says something lacerating.” (Playing a racist yet heartwarming biddy, Ms. Smith is a best-supporting-actress hopeful.)But it was Judi Dench who was instrumental in getting the film made, and made with the right demographic. “I did a disgraceful thing to get Judi to do the movie, which was heinously embarrassing, that I’ve never told her,” Mr. Parker said. After seeing that Ms. Dench was known to say “What larks, Pip!” — a phrase from Charles Dickens — “I plopped that into the script,” Mr. Parker said.“Judi’s daughter read the script first,” he continued, “and got to that part and said, ‘Oh my God, Mum, you have to do this, because she talks exactly like you.’ ”Tony KushnerFor all the historical research he did for “Lincoln,” the writing that most excited Mr. Kushner was the made-up stuff. “Especially the stuff behind the scenes,” with Secretary of State William H. Seward and Lincoln discussing the 13th Amendment. “There are no records at all,” Mr. Kushner said. “We know that it happened, but we don’t know what was said. They didn’t leave a paper trail. So that gives you room to dramatize.”Mr. Kushner, a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, used newspaper and witness accounts to help with the speechifying in the House of Representatives, but “they didn’t actually transcribe in the 19th century,” he said. “They sort of reported in a narrative, and senators or congressmen would submit what they had said.”“As long as I stayed true to the historical moment,” he added, “I felt like I had the right to invent.”In the course of the year that Daniel Day-Lewis prepared to play Lincoln, Mr. Kushner worked with him on shaping the president’s oratory. “He wanted to go through the stories,” Mr. Kushner said. “I don’t know that he feels that he’s a natural storyteller, and Lincoln was, so he wanted to make sure that the stories fit in his mouth well.” (Still, Mr. Day-Lewis kept the accent he was developing to himself. “The first time I heard him as Lincoln was on the first day of shooting,” Mr. Kushner said.)Mr. Kushner can take credit for burnishing a long Lincolnian anecdote with a punch line involving an outhouse. “I turned it into my own version of it,” he said. But “I’m certain that he told that story,” he added. “He had a fondness, often, for toilet humor.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/books/scientology-fascinates-the-author-lawrence-wright.html,"AUSTIN, Tex. — The writer Lawrence Wright doesn’t seem at all the sort of person you’d find in public wearing a black cowboy shirt emblazoned with big white buffalos. He’s shy, soft-spoken, a little professorial. But as if he didn’t have enough to do, besides working on three plays simultaneously and getting ready to publish a new book in two weeks, Mr. Wright has been taking piano lessons with Floyd Domino, the two-time Grammy winner, and on a recent Saturday, in his buffalo shirt, he played in a concert at the Victory Grill here with the band WhoDo. Mr. Wright was at the keyboard, and sang solo on “Sixty-Minute Man” and the Count Basie tune “She’s Funny That Way.” Not bad for a bookworm.“I decided a while ago that I would only do things that are really important or really fun,” Mr. Wright said. “This is really fun.”More fun, probably, than dealing with lawyers. His new book, “Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, & the Prison of Belief” (Knopf) is about the famously litigious Church of Scientology, and he said he has received innumerable threatening letters from lawyers representing the church or some of the celebrities who belong to it. (Transworld, Mr. Wright’s British publisher, recently canceled its plans to publish “Going Clear,” though a spokeswoman insisted that the decision was not made in response to threats from the church.)The book, which recounts the history of Scientology through the interwoven stories of key figures like L. Ron Hubbard, the religion’s founder, and celebrity Scientologists like John Travolta and Tom Cruise, claims among other things that the church has virtually imprisoned some of its members, threatening blackmail if they try to leave, and that its current leader, David Miscavige, has physically abused some of his underlings. The book won’t do anything to enhance the image of Scientology, already diminished by Janet Reitman’s 2011 book, “Inside Scientology: The History of the World’s Most Secretive Religion.”In a statement, Karin Pouw, a Scientology spokeswoman, said Mr. Wright and his publisher refused to provide a copy of the book in advance and “showed little interest in receiving input” from the church. “The portions you cite from the book are preposterous lies,” she said, adding that “the allegation about Mr. Miscavige is false and defamatory.”But Mr. Wright insists that he did not set out to write an exposé. “Why would I bother to do that?” he said. “Scientology is probably the most stigmatized religion in America already. But I’m fascinated by it and by what drives people to Scientology, especially given its image.”He added: “There are many countries where you can only believe more or you can believe less. But in the United States we have this incredible smorgasbord, and it really interests me why people are drawn to one faith rather than another, especially to a system of belief that to an outsider seems absurd or dangerous.”Mr. Wright, whose previous book, “The Looming Tower:” Al-Qaeda and the Road to 9/11,” won the Pulitzer Prize in 2007, is no stranger to writing about secretive organizations. In the case of Scientology, he said, he had been looking for what he calls a “donkey” — a character strong and sympathetic enough to carry a complicated story. “I don’t mean it in a disparaging way,” he explained. “A donkey is a very useful beast of burden.” In 2010 he finally found one in Paul Haggis, the winner of back-to-back Oscars for “Million Dollar Baby,” which he wrote, and “Crash,” which he wrote and directed, who defected from Scientology in 2009, after 34 years in the church, during which he rose to one of its highest ranks.In 2011 Mr. Wright published a profile of Mr. Haggis in The New Yorker, and in the course of the fact-checking process Tommy Davis, the international spokesman for Scientology, did Mr. Wright an unwitting favor. He showed up in The New Yorker offices with four lawyers and 47 white binders full of material about the church.“I suppose the idea was to drown me in information,” Mr. Wright recalled, “but it was like trying to pour water on a fish. I looked on those binders with a feeling of absolute joy.”Among his peers Mr. Wright is known for his thoroughness and for his legal pads and his filing-card system, which in the computer age is as complicated and as antique as the historian Robert Caro’s. Lauren Wolf, a recent graduate of the journalism school at the University of Texas, who worked for Mr. Wright as a fact checker and researcher on “Going Clear,” said, “I think the reason Larry hired me was that in the interview I said, ‘I think one of my faults is that I don’t know when to stop researching.’ He looked at me and said, ‘I don’t think that’s a fault.’ ”She added: “He’s incredibly thorough. He does an immense amount of reading and researching and talking to sources.”In all Mr. Wright spoke to some 200 current and former Scientologists, only a few of whom insisted on anonymity. He started with Mr. Haggis, he said, and one name led to another. It helped that, starting in 2009, a number of high-ranking officials had broken from the church and began talking to The St. Petersburg Times. (The spiritual headquarters of Scientology is in nearby Clearwater, Fla.)“The church for decades has been mopping up as much information as they can,” Mr. Wright said. “That’s why there are so few photographs in the book. They’ve also silenced people through nondisclosure agreements and through intimidation. But this has not been a perfect job on the part of the church.“There are a lot of people out there who were very high up in the church and know a lot about it who have become outspoken. I’m very lucky to come along at a time when a lot of these people are ready to talk.”One of his sources, Amy Scobee, said of meeting Mr. Wright: “I had already taken the plunge and decided to speak out. But I’ve been approached by a lot of people who just want a quick sound bite. He wasn’t a Johnny come lately. I felt he had real integrity.”Another ex-Scientologist, Tom De Vocht, a construction manager for the church who left after 28 years, said: “I could tell that Larry wasn’t just out to get the church — which would have been fine with me, actually. He really had dug into this, which made it easier to talk to him.” He added: “I couldn’t not say anything. I feel I’ve got to make the truth known.”A color-coded outline for “Going Clear” is still on a wall-size whiteboard in Mr. Wright’s office in his house here. Next to it is an equally large whiteboard outlining a play Mr. Wright has written about the Camp David accords, which is expected to have its premiere at Arena Stage in Washington next season. In February he is going to London for a reading of a play he has written about the making of the movie “Cleopatra.” And in March a play he has written about the journalist Oriana Fallaci will open at Berkeley Rep in California.Fallaci, he explained, was someone he admired and in some ways loathed. “She was a very formative figure for me,” Mr. Wright said, “though I’m not sure what I think about some of her techniques now. She went a little crazy at the end and after 9/11 her anti-Muslim rhetoric was so provocative and inflammatory. But I’m still very interested in the tension between Islam and the West, and so Oriana Fallaci became for me a great vehicle, another donkey.”Mr. Wright, who despite his shyness has also appeared in two one-man shows based on his own journalism, said that he didn’t see much disconnection between his books and his theatrical writing.“They’re all kin,” he said. “I did interviews and have note cards for Oriana.” He also interviewed people who had worked on “Cleopatra.” “I like the serendipitous surprises of reality,” he said. “I get more pleasure from discovering it than from inventing it.”Excusing himself because he had to go practice the piano, he added, “I get very antsy when I’m not occupied.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/sports/ncaafootball/for-notre-dames-brian-kelly-grand-valley-remains-near.html,"Before Brian Kelly restored the luster to Notre Dame, he coached the Lakers. These were not the Los Angeles Lakers; more like the complete opposite. These were the Grand Valley State Lakers, a Division II football team in Allendale, Mich.This was not a brief stopover for Kelly, a steppingstone on the usual itinerant career path, a place to spend a year or two and beef up the old résumé while keeping one eye cocked toward somewhere better. Kelly built the foundation of his career at Grand Valley.There, he became a coach.He arrived in 1987 as a graduate assistant, a bachelor and glorified gofer who pocketed $4,000 annually the first two years and $12,000 after that. He left for Central Michigan after the 2003 season with 118 victories and 2 national championships, with a family and a system he believed in, a system he knew would work at the highest level. Even at Notre Dame.At Grand Valley, Kelly met and married his wife, Paqui. They used to run together at lunchtime (she set the pace). They had three children there. He became a defensive coordinator and a head coach, both for the first time. He learned how to recruit, adapt, ignore those who clamored for his job. He also learned a special class of players could transform a program, long before it happened again this season at Notre Dame.His former players and assistants and support staff have watched Kelly on television. They saw the undefeated regular season that will culminate in the Bowl Championship Series national title game against Alabama on Monday.They see the familiar beet-red face, the temper, the wrath, the familiar schemes and tendencies.Mostly, they see their coach, in charge of perhaps the nation’s most storied program, so much changed and yet so little different.“He was born and bred at Grand Valley State, small town, Division II,” said Curt Anes, the quarterback who helped Kelly change it all. “He might be at Notre Dame now, but I’ll tell you something: he hasn’t changed a bit.”Well, he has changed some. The Kelly who drove his Ford Escort through the cornfields was younger, slimmer and poorer than this version.He fit in well immediately at Grand Valley. Staffers described the young Kelly as intense, a climber, but not so much that he overstepped. They noticed his intelligence, confidence and charisma. They insist they knew he would do big things, great things. But Notre Dame? Head coach? Undefeated?Of course they did not expect that.“I needed to learn how to be a head coach,” Kelly said in a phone interview. “Everybody wants to be one, but Grand Valley provided me on-the-job training. It prepared me for everything that came after.”It’s almost surreal now how all the dots connect. How Tom Beck, the man who hired Kelly, left to join Lou Holtz at Notre Dame in 1991. How three candidates emerged as potential successors to Beck. How Kelly beat them out for the job at 28.In his second game in charge, Kelly’s Lakers played at North Dakota State, the undefeated defending national champion, winner of an obscene number of consecutive home games. Grand Valley could not afford a hotel and flew in the day of the game. Yet when the Lakers recorded an upset, Don Thomas, the former longtime sports information director, remembered that Kelly just stood there, alone and dumbfounded.Grand Valley made the playoffs in 1991 and again in 1994, losing its first game each time. In 1996, an athletic director named Tim Selgo arrived from Toledo, where he had worked with another promising young coach — Nick Saban, now at Alabama, Kelly’s counterpart in the national title game.Selgo asked Kelly to a Detroit Tigers game. He insisted they drive together, some five hours there and back. Kelly reminded Selgo of Saban, and while Selgo could not remember the score of the game, he could recall the impression Kelly made.“One thing about Brian, why he’s a perfect fit for Notre Dame, is he appreciates and understands the total picture,” Selgo said. “He knows how to build a program. I could see it at Grand Valley. I can sense it at Notre Dame.”Kelly returned to the playoffs in 1998, where he again lost his opener. The grumbling started soon after: Kelly could not win the big game, not even a single playoff victory.That was before the recruiting class of 1998, the class that altered Kelly’s career path. It started Grand Valley on its way to becoming a Division II athletic juggernaut, and, it could be argued, helped rescue Notre Dame from football mediocrity because of the events it set in motion.“What happened in the years to come was mind-boggling,” said Tim Nott, an associate athletic director with Grand Valley since 1997.Kelly found Anes in a wing-T high school offense that hid his considerable talents. The day before Kelly showed up at Anes’s high school unannounced, Anes turned down the coach at Ferris State, Grand Valley’s rival. “Thanks but no thanks, Coach,” Anes said. “I’m not playing Division II.”Then Kelly showed up, and Anes told his friends: “Here’s another D-II guy. I’m going to lay him down softly.”Anes sat down with Kelly in an office inside the locker room. Kelly laid out his vision, what he called The Plan, how Anes would travel to Grand Valley State in two days for an official visit, commit that weekend, come to school, break every Grand Valley passing record and lead the Lakers to a national title.“It was almost like he prophesied over me,” Anes said.Anes was but one important component of The Plan. Kelly filled that class with players as good as any in Division II. There was David Kircus, the receiver who scored 76 career touchdowns. And there were the Hosford twins, the defensive lineman Dan and the offensive lineman Tom, the offspring of Jamie Hosford, the greatest athlete in Grand Valley State history. The Hosford boys, Kelly said, provided the backbone of those teams. They pointed their praise back at him.“We sat in the locker room as freshmen talking about playing for the national championship, before we even realized we could do it,” Dan Hosford said. “Brian was the guy behind that. He believed in us before we even did.”Much of that class redshirted in 1998, then stumbled to a 5-5 record in 1999, a season that was among the worst in Grand Valley State history. Selgo pushed for a contract extension for Kelly, because he believed in the coach and the class of ’98.After the final game, Anes told a local columnist it was “just a matter of time” before the Lakers competed for a national championship. Kelly summoned Anes to his office, looked at Anes and smiled.“O.K., let’s do it,” he said.The next season, the Lakers started 1-4 but won their final six games. Kelly, as he would show later at Central Michigan, Cincinnati and Notre Dame, was adaptable. He visited Northwestern and Oklahoma State, and he borrowed from their offensive philosophies to install a spread system of his own. He built around the talent that existed.The 2001 team ran a no-huddle offense that averaged more than 600 yards and 58.6 points. Nott had to start keeping statistical averages by quarter, since most of the starters rarely played in the second half.In the first round of the playoffs, Anes tore every ligament in his knee, when his leg stuck in the field and twisted so far around that he said his hamstring hit the ground before his calf did; the calf muscle ripped off the bone. The following week, Kelly installed a wishbone offense, and the Lakers still advanced to the championship game, which they lost.Kelly and the Lakers went undefeated in 2002. Grand Valley claimed 11 all-American slots that year, many from that ’98 recruiting class. Anes won the Harlon Hill Trophy, the top honor in Division II.“There were so many similarities between that class and my senior class now at Notre Dame,” Kelly said. “Took some lumps along the way. Went through some adversity. But you could see it coming. You could feel it.”Kelly would adapt again the next season and win another championship, this time with defense. He left for Central Michigan for the 2004 campaign, and after three seasons there moved to Cincinnati. The system he constructed would produce two more championships at Grand Valley State under Chuck Martin, now Kelly’s assistant at Notre Dame.This success would bleed into other sports. The 2002 title marked the university’s first ever, in any sport. Now, Grand Valley has won 14 championships. Admissions rose. So did overall interest.“If Brian didn’t recruit those guys, if he didn’t have that success, he might not have gotten out of Grand Valley,” Nott said. “He might not have gone to Central Michigan. He might not be at Notre Dame.”Except all that did happen. Kelly did recruit, did build this Notre Dame championship contender with defense and another special class, albeit one that he inherited. Grand Valley State had taught him to mold the system to the talent.“He always reminded me of Bill Clinton,” Selgo said. “Like the way he made people feel in his presence. The way everyone felt like they were a part of something.”A few years back, Grand Valley State inducted Kelly into its Hall of Fame. He thanked more than a dozen people in his acceptance speech, and without a single note jotted down. He spoke about how the university prepared and changed and made him. He donated money for a sports center and mentioned the university in news conferences. He designed his Kelly Cares Foundation on lessons he learned there, and every event he held reminded him of where it all had started.He still stumped for Grand Valley, long after he left. Once a Laker, always a Laker.Showtime is where Brian Kelly made it."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/fashion/on-this-hit-show-the-clothes-make-the-girls.html,"MAYBE it was the episode when Hannah, the main character on the HBO series “Girls,” wore a cardigan festooned with tomatoes to her first paid job, at a law office. Or the one in which Marnie, her uptight best friend, wore a bright little cocktail dress to a Bushwick loft party. Or the one where Jessa wore a long see-through eyelet dress over hot pink underwear to her gig as a nanny.It’s hard to pin down the exact moment, but at some point while watching the show last spring, I had an unexpected flashback to an ensemble I wore when I was just out of college: a black romper with knickers paired with a white oxford shirt, a red necktie and tights with Lichtenstein-esque cartoons on them. I referred to this get-up as my “signature outfit” and wore it primarily on job interviews.Such is the difference between “Girls,” whose second season begins on Jan. 13, and its most obvious predecessor, “Sex and the City.” You watched Sarah Jessica Parker et al and thought, I wish I had those shoes. You watch Lena Dunham and crew and think, There, with the grace of God, I wenteth.The fashions on “Girls” may not be aspirational, but they are very much intentional. “We are very conscious about what the girls are wearing,” said Ms. Dunham, the show’s 26-year-old creator/writer/director, who plays Hannah. “We spend a lot of time talking about that outfit you can’t believe you wore but you know you spent three days dreaming up.”The show’s costume designer, Jennifer Rogien, agreed. “The overall theme of the show is all the mistakes we go through when we’re trying to find our footing,” she said. “We wanted to embrace all those factors — the youth, the first job, the insecurity in relationships, both romantic and friendship — and see if we could reflect that through the clothing.”Where “Sex and the City” created a high-end designer-driven fantasy, “Girls” strives above all else for authenticity. “We were really concerned about realism, verisimilitude,” Ms. Dunham said, adding that Jenni Konner, an executive producer, “is always there at my costume fittings to say, ‘That fits a little too well.’ ”“She’s always calling out the potential for any TV-matchy-cutesy-ness,” Ms. Dunham said.Key to this ethos, Ms. Konner said, is “never having things that are beyond what these girls can afford.” The show’s most polished looks come from designers like Theory and Tibi, and the decidedly un-Carrie Bradshaw Ann Taylor. Characters also wear some clothes repeatedly.“Hannah had a pair of very well-loved Rachel Antonoff for Bass loafers that she wore a lot in Season 1,” Ms. Rogien said.Ms. Dunham said that whenever she saw those shoes, “I was like: ‘Oh, yay! My loafers!’ ”(Side fact: Those shoes were designed by the sister of Jack Antonoff, who is a member of the Grammy-nominated band Fun., and also Ms. Dunham’s boyfriend.)“It always makes me so crazy when people on shows have a new winter coat every day,” Ms. Dunham said. “I wore the same winter coat for three years after college, even after my dog peed on it.”Like the experiences portrayed on the show, wardrobes are often imbued with autobiographical specificity. “I once got in a fight with one of my best friends while she was wearing a plastic dress,” Ms. Dunham said. “And the plastic dress became an example of our conflict — like, ‘You’re changing, you’re wearing a plastic dress.’ The plastic dress found a home in Season 2.”The show often draws the viewer’s attention to its characters’ sartorial crimes. When Hannah reports to her first day of work at a coffee shop in a white dress, her boss tells her to go home and change, saying, “This isn’t a consumptive women’s hospital.” Seeing Marnie in a low-cut floral dress, a character greets her with, “Hello, J.Lo at the Grammys.” In a memorable moment early in Season 2, Marnie, played by Allison Williams, calls Hannah out on her hilariously awful neon mesh top by saying, “What are you wearing?”“Girls” may be antiglamour, but, in keeping with the show’s larger search-for-identity theme, it is very much about personal style.The wardrobes, said Ms. Rogien, who previously worked on “The Good Wife” and “Bored to Death,” “are extremely character-driven.”For these characters, outfits are an important form of self-expression, Ms. Dunham said. “The clothes are really meant to reflect the fantasy the girls have about themselves and are sort of unsuccessfully fulfilling,” she said.Each girl has her own distinct style. Hannah, Ms. Rogien said, is “lovingly disheveled.”Much of Hannah’s mix-and-match outfits comes from vintage and thrift stores and sometimes yield looks that don’t look that flattering on the character. “But she’s fully committed to them,” Ms. Rogien explained. In fact, she said, “sometimes we tailor the clothes to fit her even worse.”Marnie, Hannah’s uptight best friend, suffers from the opposite problem. “She’s very put together,” Ms. Rogien said. Marnie favors structured sheath dresses and wears pieces from Black Halo and DVF. “She’s trying really hard to be professional, to be grown-up, and sometimes she overshoots.” As in Season 1, when she dons a Tibi dress and pumps for a party in Bushwick. “She’s wearing essentially a bat mitzvah dress to a grungy loft party,” Ms. Rogien said.Shoshanna, the quirkily nervous New York University student played by Zosia Mamet, is the most concerned with outfit propriety. “She’s someone whose reading every book, every magazine and kind of using every fashion rule together at once,” Ms. Konner said.And she shops, as Ms. Rogien explained. “She’s got both time and potentially a little money to do a little bit of shopping, she said. “We shop her in Bloomingdale’s and Saks.”Shoshanna is also a big fan of loungewear. She has been known to sport a Juicy Couture sweatsuit, and memorably watched TV in a purple peace-sign snuggy. (“I love that snuggy,” Ms. Rogien said.)Ms. Mamet said: “It’s about the proper attire for every moment. Even her pajamas match.”And the bohemian Jessa, played by Jemima Kirke, is, Ms. Dunham said, “a girl with an innately cool sense of style whose confidence can veer into the crazily inappropriate.” Not only did Jessa wear the aforementioned sheer dress to baby-sit (“it’s floor-length,” she said, by way of justification), but she also wore a bathrobe, Ugg boots and geisha-esque hair and makeup to meet up with an ex-boyfriend for a stroll in the park.The character’s style is, in fact, quite similar to Ms. Kirke’s in real life. “I went to high school with Jemima,” Ms. Dunham said, “and dressing like Jemima was the top pursuit of every girl.”Many of Jessa’s clothes have, in fact, been based on Ms. Kirke’s real-life outfits, and, in the case of some pieces, like her quickie wedding dress, culled from Geminola, the West Village store owned by her mother, the designer Lorraine Kirke. The elder Ms. Kirke’s repurposed vintage designs were featured on “Sex and the City,” and Ms. Dunham herself worked at Geminola during college.The store, a small space on a quaint street with ripped wallpaper and tasseled chandeliers where the majority of prices fall in the $295-to-$695 range, seems like a place Jessa could grow up to own. “It’s a little bit Moulin Rouge brothel,” Ms. Dunham said, “but also sort of a sophisticated French salon. Jemima’s house is kind of that way, too.”Ms. Dunham recalled that, when she worked there, “It would be like no one would come in all day, and then like some really fancy model would come in and buy 15 chandeliers and 9 dresses.”In a recent phone interview, Ms. Kirke, the designer/proprietor, said that she didn’t recall Ms. Dunham’s time in her store. “But Jemima” — who could be heard in the background — “says I was horrible to her,” she added. “Basically, I started the store to give my daughters’ friends weekend jobs.”Ms. Dunham’s own long connection to fashion raises an obvious question. Not only did Ms. Dunham, a child of two artists and a graduate of Brooklyn’s St. Ann’s School, work at Geminola, but she also was recently shot by Annie Leibovitz in the outfit that her baby sitter, the designer Zac Posen, made her for her high-school graduation.Surely, Ms. Dunham’s personal style must diverge from Hannah’s? After all, she did wear Prada to the Emmys.“Hannah dresses similarly to the way I dressed in late college or when I just graduated,” Ms. Dunham said. “I was less concerned with things looking good on me and more concerned with things being funny or interesting or quirky. I was a really big proponent of the sacklike bubble dress, unfortunately.”Ms. Konner described Ms. Dunham’s look. “Lena dresses not only much older than Hannah, but much older than her age,” she said. “She’s very ladylike. I rarely see her wearing jeans, and when she does it’s with some kind of stylish blazer.”Ms. Dunham said: “I always like to think of myself as dressing like a fancy lady at Radcliffe. That’s my fantasy about what’s going on.”In this respect, Ms. Dunham, who has drawn much attention for her willingness to expose her decidedly non-Hollywood body, is equally notable for her choices when clothed.When given creative control, few actresses have decided to create characters who look worse on television than they themselves do in life. Lucille Ball had no problem stuffing chocolates in her mouth off an assembly line or crushing grapes with her feet, but she did so in perfect hair and makeup. Tina Fey’s Liz Lemon makes self-deprecating jokes about her still-quite attractive appearance. Even Roseanne Barr, the foremother of female-driven sitcom realism, grew prettier, slimmer and more made-up as her show continued its run.“The first time I met Lena,” Ms. Konner recalled, “was after seeing ‘Tiny Furniture,’ ” Ms. Dunham’s debut feature film. “I remember being like, Oh, my God, you’re so pretty! She plays herself down so much, which was surprising because it’s so unusual.”Ms. Dunham said she knew “it wouldn’t be everyone’s choice.” But, she added: “I’m never tortured by seeing bad photographs of myself either. It’s not an ‘I need to do this for the sisterhood’ thing. It’s just a sense of trying to stay true to the characters and what we’re writing about.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/arts/television/downton-abbey-begins-third-season-on-sunday-on-pbs.html,"A lot of time and discussion have been spent deciphering the extraordinary success of “Downton Abbey,” but it’s actually pretty simple. This series about British aristocrats and their servants is “Fifty Shades of Grey”: soft-core pornography, but fixated on breeding and heritage rather than kinky sex.The infamous “Fifty Shades” S-and-M trilogy by E. L. James began as an e-book and became a publishing sensation by adding a frisson of “Story of O”-style bondage to an old-fashioned romance novel. And “Downton Abbey,” which was supposed to last only one season, is beginning its third on PBS on Sunday and is basically a romance novel with a thick dollop of “The Forsyte Saga.” The books have gall; the television series has Galsworthy.The costumes and settings differ, but they rely on the same formula. In both works no crisis lasts forever, and no loss, however saddening, is insurmountable. The same set pieces are repeated, with some but not much variation, from one book — or season — to another. The novels keep offering whips-and-velvet couplings between the innocent young heroine and her rich, handsome dominator/lover. “Downton Abbey” reconfigures conflicts between the lords and ladies upstairs that are mirrored by tensions among the servants below.Both offer fans pleasurable suspense with only the faint intimation of actual pain. Unpleasantness doesn’t last long or leave marks, be it a whipping in the secret playroom or combat injuries in the trenches of World War I. Season 2 of “Downton Abbey” was too much of a good thing — enjoyable but almost embarrassingly so. Season 3 is more of the same. World War I is over, and the British Empire is already in its twilight, but somehow the devastation of the epoch hasn’t fully sunk in. Change is in the air, but not yet in the bloodstream. The inhabitants of Downton Abbey, upstairs and down, talk of progress (an electric toaster scandalizes the butler), but without much awareness of what it will do to their way of life.It’s that cheeriness that makes the show such delightful escapism. “Downton Abbey” has all the romance and elegance of “Brideshead Revisited” without the censure and foreboding that distinguished that and other more somber examinations of the British class system, be it the 1993 movie “The Remains of the Day” or Ford Madox Ford’s masterpiece, “Parade’s End,” which was adapted for the BBC by Tom Stoppard and will be coming to HBO this year.The new season of “Downton Abbey” picks up in 1920. Matthew Crawley (Dan Stevens) and his true love, Lady Mary (Michelle Dockery), are at long last preparing for their wedding, a society event so exalted it lures even Lady Mary’s daunting American grandmother, Martha, played by Shirley MacLaine. Martha is rich, presumptuous and pushy, the kind of woman who greets the bride by saying, “Tell me all of your wedding plans, and I’ll see what I can do to improve them.”And she is almost a match for the indomitable Violet, the Dowager Countess of Grantham, played by Maggie Smith. Violet tells her daughter-in-law, Cora, that she is looking forward to seeing Cora’s mother again: “When I’m with her I am reminded of the virtues of the English.”Matthew takes the bait. “But isn’t she American?” he asks.“Exactly,” Violet replies.There are a few new flirtations downstairs, but mostly old love stories are revived with a fresh cycle of separation and reunion. Bates (Brendan Coyle), the valet, is in prison for murdering his former wife, and his loyal current wife, Anna (Joanne Froggatt), won’t stop trying to clear his name.Neither will the Downton household — the estate’s family and the help are on her side. When a servant mutters something about Bates’s being a convicted murderer, the butler, Mr. Carson (Jim Carter), puts the impertinent upstart in his place.“In this house,” he intones, “Mr. Bates is a wronged man seeking justice.”And justice in this world isn’t such a long shot. On “Downton Abbey” judicial sentences can be reversed with the same ease that spine injuries are cured and curdled mayonnaise is restored. Fortunes lost can be regained, some class lines can be breached, and love triumphs again and again, and then one more time.“Downton Abbey” is a fantasy that gets sillier in prolongation, and as is the case with “Fifty Shades of Grey,” there is a huge audience that cannot get enough."

One of its satisfactions is that the story that unfolds inside the ring is not the same one that the filmmakers seem keen to sell, Manohla Dargis said in The Times. “Their Cinderella Man is the decent little guy who affirms what movie people call the triumph of the human spirit,” she wrote. “The story Mr. Crowe tells, with Mr. Giamatti as a gleeful Mephistopheles, is that of a man who, having sampled the blood of others, clearly enjoyed the taste.” KATHRYN SHATTUCK"

Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.★ ‘Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry’ (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)★ ‘Amour’ (PG-13, 2:07) A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between, the latest from the great director Michael Haneke (“The White Ribbon,” “Caché”) takes a long, hard, tender look at an elderly French couple, Georges and Anne — played by two titans of French cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva — in their final days. Bring hankies. (Dargis)★ ‘Anna Karenina’ (R, 2:10) Joe Wright’s version of the Tolstoy novel, with a script by Tom Stoppard, is wildly, sometimes dizzily theatrical, taking place mostly on a series of elaborate stage sets. The story of Anna (Keira Knightley), her humorless husband (Jude Law) and her lover, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) becomes a lush melodrama, counterpointed by the delicate romance of Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and Levin (Domhnall Gleeson). Not a faithful adaptation, by any means, but something better: a bold, lively and ardent reimagining of the book. (A. O. Scott)★ ‘Any Day Now’ (R, 1:37) In this militant tear-jerker, Alan Cumming gives a blazing performance as a drag queen who with his live-in lover, a lawyer, tries to adopt a throwaway child with Down syndrome. (Stephen Holden)★ ‘Argo’ (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)★ ‘Barbara’ (PG-13; 1:45) Christian Petzold directs this tense, smart film about an East German doctor (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been banished to the boonies. There, in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police, she waits and she burns. (Dargis)‘Beware of Mr. Baker’ (No rating, 1:32) The life and times of the great rock drummer Ginger Baker — of Cream, Blind Faith and a bunch of other bands — filtered through interviews with friends, colleagues, ex-wives and the man himself, visited at some peril by the filmmaker Jay Bulger. Not a nice man, Mr. Baker, but a fascinating study in musical discipline, personal recklessness and postwar British history. (Scott)‘The Central Park Five’ (No rating, 1:59) Directed by Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns, this documentary revisits the 1989 rape and beating of the white woman known as the Central Park jogger and the five black and Latino teenagers accused of assaulting her. The five were imprisoned but later exonerated; the filmmakers look back at what happened and why. (Dargis)★ ‘Chasing Ice’ (PG-13, 1:16) The timing couldn’t be better for this documentary about the work of James Balog, who set out to provide visual evidence of the effects of global warming by taking time-lapse photographs of melting glaciers. The images are as beautiful as they are important. (Neil Genzlinger)‘Cirque du Soleil Worlds Away’ (PG; 1:31) If you can’t make it to Las Vegas this holiday season, you might choose to spend an hour and a half watching hot Canadian acrobats in crazy costumes. (Scott)‘Detropia’ (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady’s dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Jeannette Catsoulis)‘Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel’ (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis)★ ‘Django Unchained’ (R, 2:45) Blaxploitation and spaghetti western meet in the Old South in Quentin Tarantino’s latest provocation, with — literally! — explosive results. Jamie Foxx is Django, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), whose partner and protégé he becomes. After the two kill off a bunch of bad guys, they set off to free Django’s wife (Kerry Washington) from captivity at a nightmarish plantation called Candyland. Bloody, farcical and cartoonish, “Django Unchained” is at once a wildly entertaining, borderline-irresponsible fantasy and a bold and serious attempt to use the imaginative resources of popular culture to address an old and durable historical injustice. (Scott)★ ‘Flight’  (R, 2:18) A titanic Denzel Washington plays a veteran commercial pilot whose greatest vocation should be his flying but has instead, for various reasons, become his drinking. Robert Zemeckis directs his finest movie since “Cast Away.” (Dargis)‘The Guilt Trip’ (PG-13, 1:35) In this road-trip comedy, Barbra Streisand and Seth Rogen sustain an easygoing rapport playing a mother and her grown-up son crossing the country by car. But the movie is much too bland and cozy to strike comic sparks. (Holden)‘Hitchcock’ (PG-13, 1:38) Anthony Hopkins, buried under a fat suit and facial prosthetics, stars as Alfred Hitchcock in a movie about the making of “Psycho.” Directed by the fearlessly unsubtle Sacha Gervasi, the movie suggests that the Master of Suspense was himself a little psycho and could only work from a place of madness. It doesn’t merely give creative genius a bad name, it also pathologizes it. An overly glammed up Helen Mirren plays Hitch’s wife, Alma. (Dargis)‘The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’ (PG-13, 2:50) Peter Jackson’s adaptation of the J.R.R. Tolkien novel — the first in a trilogy of films — is a slick, bloated lumbering bore, a profit-minded exercise in theme-park-ride cinema that has neither the charm of the book nor the grandeur of Mr. Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” movies. (Scott)★ ‘Holy Motors’ (No rating, 1:55, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)★ ‘How to Survive a Plague’ (No rating, 1:49) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France’s inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)‘Hyde Park on Hudson’ (R, 1:34) Bill Murray plays Franklin D. Roosevelt in a period film directed by Roger Michell and written by Richard Nelson that suggests that the 32nd president of the United States and his distant, woefully dreary cousin, Daisy Suckley (Laura Linney), did more than kiss. Roosevelt was a towering figure, but his life and deeds scarcely register in this amorphous, bafflingly aimless movie. (Dargis)‘The Impossible’ (PG-13; 1:47) A story of survival set against the Asian tsunami of 2004, about a British family (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are the parents) vacationing in Thailand when disaster strikes. The performances are excellent (Tom Holland, as the couple’s oldest son, is especially strong) and the director, Juan Antonio Bayona, deftly recreates both the violence of the killer waves and the desolation they left in their wake. Still, there is something troubling about the film’s almost complete neglect of the non-Western victims of the tsunami. This is the story of a very bad holiday rather than of a mass catastrophe. (Scott)‘Jack Reacher’ (PG-13; 2:10) Jack who? If you need to ask, you may be at the wrong movie, but just in case: He is the ex-military vigilante from Lee Child’s series of macho pulp novels, played by Tom Cruise and hunting down killers in the city of Pittsburgh. Much duller than it sounds, except when Werner Herzog or Robert Duvall is on screen. (Scott)‘Just 45 Minutes From Broadway’ (R, 1:48) This reverent sendup, from the prolific Henry Jaglom, borders on farce (but not enough) when dropping in on a family of actors who can’t turn off their performing in life, for better or worse — though the better is sometimes hard to imagine with this crew of hams. Most of the performers do fine work, given the muddy genre, but the film’s crop of clichés is dispiriting, in result if not intent. (David DeWitt)★ ‘A Late Quartet’ (R, 1:45) The upheavals that threaten the future of the fictional Fugue String Quartet in Yaron Zilberman’s magnificently acted film may be wildly exaggerated. But it would be shortsighted to dismiss this deeply felt, musically savvy film set in a refined cultural precinct of Manhattan as sudsy melodrama. (Holden)‘Life of Pi’ (PG, 2:06) In bringing Yann Martel’s beloved novel to the screen, Ang Lee has created a 3-D digital fable that is often stunning to behold. The middle section, in which the title character and a Bengal tiger share a lifeboat after a shipwreck, is touching and clever, but its delicacy is spoiled by a fuzzy, cloying spiritualism that hangs over everything like a humid cloud. (Scott)★ ‘Lincoln’ (PG-13, 2:29) Daniel Day-Lewis plays the Great Emancipator with playful wit as well as gravity. This film, directed by Steven Spielberg from a bristling, discursive script by Tony Kushner, focuses on Lincoln’s political skills and confines itself mainly to a single momentous month in his presidency. Anyone capable of being moved — or appalled — by the workings of democracy is likely to be enthralled by the intricate battle of wills surrounding the passage of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States. The superb supporting cast (including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln, and Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens) helps turn the movie into a group portrait of leadership in crisis. It’s a democratic masterpiece — a history lesson full of historical detail and honest patriotic emotion. (Scott)★ ‘The Master’ (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)‘Les Misérables’ (PG-13, 2:37) Tom Hooper (“The King’s Speech”) directs this overly busy screen version of the popular musical with Hugh Jackman as the reformed prisoner, Russell Crowe as his tormentor and Anne Hathaway as the prostitute turned martyr. By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat. (Dargis)★ ‘Not Fade Away’ (R; 1:52) The first feature film by David Chase, creator of “The Sopranos,” is a loving, acutely detailed portrait of 1960s rock ’n’ roll culture as experienced by a New Jersey teenager with rock star dreams. (Holden)‘On the Road’ (R; 2:04) The Brazilian director Walter Salles’s film of Jack Kerouac’s “On the Road,” is pungent and picturesque and has a sensational jazz soundtrack, but its lead male roles, especially that of Kerouac, are sadly miscast. (Holden)‘Parental Guidance’ (PG, 1:44) Billy Crystal stars as a baseball announcer who, when not being indulged by his wife (Bette Midler), schools his daughter (Marisa Tomei) and grandkids on the right way to do everything. Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse wrote the script, and Andy Fickman gives it some snap. (Dargis)‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’ (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who’s rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)‘Promised Land’ (R, 1:46) Matt Damon (who wrote the screenplay with his co-star John Krasinski) plays Steve Butler, dispatched to a small town by an energy conglomerate to buy the rights to underground natural gas from the local farmers. He encounters a mixed welcome, and his job is complicated by the arrival of an aggressive and charming environmental activist (Mr. Krasinski). The cast — also including Frances McDormand, Rosemarie DeWitt and Hal Holbrook — is excellent, and the director, Gus Van Sant, lingers over offbeat details and offhand moments. But when the time comes for the movie to make its point, it falls back on creaky plot twists and puffed-up, over-earnest speeches. (Scott)‘Rise of the Guardians’ (PG, 1:37) This 3-D animated feature imagines Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the Tooth Fairy and other imaginary beings as quasi-superheroes with the voices of movie stars, which is pretty cool, as are some of the witty visual touches. Less so is the film’s weary, unimaginative descent into treacly sentiment and overblown action sequences, which are supposedly what the kids want these days. (Scott)‘A Royal Affair’  (R, 2:17, in Danish) In this advanced-placement bodice-ripper, Mads Mikkelsen plays Johann Friedrich Struensee, who reformed the Danish monarchy in the 18th century while messing around with the queen. Directed by Nikolaj Arcel and based on events well known in Denmark, the film tells a fascinating story but never rises above the level of dutiful pageantry. (Scott)★ ‘Rust and Bone’ (R, 2:00, in French) Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet,” “The Beat That My Heart Skipped”) directs this tough and tender melodrama with a ferocious conviction that disguises some of its sentimental soft spots. The Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts plays Ali, a sometime prizefighter and unreliable father who befriends Stephanie (Marion Cotillard), a trainer of killer whales trying to recover after a terrible accident. The romance that blossoms between them is sexy and volatile, as are the performances, which are absolutely convincing even when the story is not. (Scott)★ ‘Searching for Sugar Man’ (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul’s hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don’t wait for the DVD. (Dargis)★ ‘The Sessions’ (R, 1:35) The movie couple of the year, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt, re-enacting the true story of a disabled, virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate infuse the movie, directed and written by Ben Lewin, with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor. (Holden)★ ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ (R, 2:00) David O. Russell’s exuberant new comedy tracks the feverish, happy, sad, absurdly funny ups and downs of a head case (Bradley Cooper) just as he returns to his parents’ home after eight months in a mental institution. When he meets a heartbreak beauty (Jennifer Lawrence), he finds fresh purpose in a movie that honks for happiness. (Dargis)★ ‘Skyfall’ (PG-13, 2:23) Directed by a surprisingly suitable Sam Mendes, this latest Bond is a superior follow-up to “Casino Royale,” the 2006 reboot that introduced the excellent Daniel Craig as 007. Playful but never frivolous, it comes off as something of a franchise rethink, partly because it brings in new faces and implies that Bond, like Jason Bourne, needed to be reborn. (Dargis)‘Tabu’ (No rating, 1:58, in Portuguese) The first half of Miguel Gomes’s elegant and elusive black-and-white film concerns a middle-aged woman living alone in present-day Lisbon, who is drawn into the life of her elderly neighbor. The second half tells, without dialogue, the story of that neighbor’s romantic adventures in the last years of Portuguese colonial rule in Africa. The mood of nostalgia — for old movies and for old social arrangements — is beguiling, if also somewhat coy. (Scott)‘This Is 40’ (R; 2:14) Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) play a Los Angeles married couple in Judd Apatow’s sloppy, generous and deeply personal new film. Facing the anxieties of approaching middle age and other related worries, they squabble, act out and wonder if they can find true happiness amid the almost unimaginable privilege they enjoy. (Scott)‘Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn, Part Two’ (PG-13. 1:55) Bella, Edward, Jacob and the rest of the fanged and furred gang say so long in this final chapter of the franchise juggernaut. The director Bill Condon, who shepherded “Part 1,” finishes up his tour of duty with some surprisingly energetic and flamboyant violence, and along the way makes the most of a game, fabulous Michael Sheen. (Dargis)★ ‘The Waiting Room’ (No rating, 1:21) The crowded emergency room of Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., is the setting of Peter Nicks’s wrenching documentary. With no narrator, titles, statistical analysis or overt editorializing, the film observes a typical 24 hours during which nearly 250 patients, most of them uninsured, pour into the hospital. (Holden)★ ‘West of Memphis’ (R, 2:25) A work of fierce documentary advocacy directed by Amy Berg (“Deliver Us From Evil”), “West of Memphis” follows the successful crusade to free three men wrongly convicted of murder 18 years ago in a sloppy, hysterical rush to justice. The film is inspiring but infuriating, because the deal to release them from prison allowed their coerced guilty plea to stand. (Holden)★ ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow’s brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid. Written by Mark Boal, the movie is a seamless weave of truth and drama as well as a wrenchingly sad, soul-shaking story about revenge and its moral costs. See it, fight over it, but don’t ignore it. (Dargis)Film SeriesAnd the Winner Is... Foreign Award Hopefuls (Friday through Sunday) A selection from the 71 feature films submitted for consideration for this year’s best foreign-language film Oscar. Only two of the ones being shown here made the Academy’s short list as announced last month: Baltasar Kormakur’s Icelandic drama of survival “The Deep” (Saturday at 6:30 p.m.) and the United Kingdom-Norway-Denmark co-production “Kon-Tiki,” a dramatization of Thor Heyerdahl’s epic voyage across the Pacific on a raft built from balsa logs, directed by Joachim Ronning and Espen Sandberg (Saturday at 8:30 p.m.). But there are doubtless discoveries to be made among the also-rans, including “Barfi!” from the Bollywood star Ranbir Kapoor (Sunday at 2 p.m.), Benjamin Avila’s Argentine political drama “Clandestine Childhood” (Friday at 8:30 p.m.) and “Caught in the Web,” a film set in the contemporary China of corporate intrigue directed by the period specialist Chen Kaige (Sunday at 7 p.m.). Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.com; $13. (Dave Kehr)‘Black Narcissus’ (Friday through Thursday) Film Forum presents a new digital restoration of this 1947 masterpiece of exotic eroticism directed by Michael Powell and written by Emeric Pressburger. Set in the heights of the Himalayas and shot in a studio outside London, the film is a radiant example of predigital artifice (production design by Alfred Junge, optical effects supervised by W. Percy Day) used to create an emotionally charged environment out of thin air. Deborah Kerr is the leader of a party of Anglican nuns sent to minister to the heathen of India who find their deepest beliefs shifting as they are exposed to a timeless world of bursting sensuality — and a hunky British officer played by David Farrar. 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $12.50. (Kehr)Vive la Jeunesse! Young French Directors (Tuesdays through Jan. 29) Each Tuesday this month the French Institute Alliance Française will be showcasing work by newcomers, beginning next week with “Un Amour de Jeunesse” (“Goodbye First Love”), Mia Hansen-Love’s 2001 film about an architectural student (Lola Créton) whose engagement is endangered when she encounters her summer love of a decade before. Other films in the series include Rebecca Zlotowski’s “Belle Épine” on Jan. 15, Guillaume Brac’s “Monde Sans Femmes” on Jan. 22 and Bijan Anquetil’s “Nuit Remue” on Jan. 29. 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, fiaf.org; $10.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/opinion/al-jazeera-in-america.html,"Al Jazeera, the pan-Arab news network, has long wanted to gain a bigger American television audience, and it may have finally found a way to do that by buying Current TV. But as the deal was being signed, Time Warner Cable announced it would immediately stop carrying Current, a struggling channel partly owned by former Vice President Al Gore. While the cable company has the legal right to cut off Current, the decision is unfortunate and could block access to an important news source.Many American policy makers and cable companies have had doubts about the impartiality of Al Jazeera, which is owned and financed by the emir of Qatar. Some have questioned the decision of Mr. Gore and his co-founder, Joel Hyatt, to sell Current, which is available to roughly 60 million American homes, to the Qatari government.The emir, though he works closely with Washington on some issues, has interests and agendas that are sometimes at odds with United States interests. Recently, for instance, Qatar along with other Arab nations is believed to have provided arms and other assistance to terrorist organizations operating in Syria. Al Jazeera says its journalism is not directed by the policies and views of its government, but the fact that it is owned by Qatar means that there is no guarantee of its independence.Nonetheless, Al Jazeera could bring an important international perspective to American audiences and should be given a chance to prove itself commercially before cable companies remove Current TV from their lineups. If Al Jazeera America, the channel that the company plans to create in New York to replace Current, fails to attract a critical mass of viewers, cable companies would be justified in removing it. On Thursday, Time Warner suggested that it might add the new channel to its systems in New York, Los Angeles and elsewhere later “as the service develops.”In the Middle East, where good, independent journalism is hard to find, Al Jazeera has distinguished itself by its thorough and smart coverage of many important stories, particularly the Arab Spring. In the early days of the revolution in Egypt, many people in America and around the world turned to it because it did a much better job on the ground than many of its international peers.Al Jazeera often brings a nuance to international stories that can be lacking on American networks, because it has more foreign correspondents and overseas bureaus than many established Western networks. Its coverage of the Arab Spring won a George Foster Peabody Award and its English-language service is broadcast to more than 250 million homes in 130 countries, including Britain, South Africa and India.Doubts about the independence of Al Jazeera do not justify removing it from cable and satellite systems. With the exception of a few places, like Washington and New York City, Al Jazeera English is not available to most American viewers. Why not let them make up their own minds about the network and its journalism?"

(Don’t miss “Reunion: Live in New York,” just out on Pi Recordings, which documents a 2007 concert he played with the multireedist Sam Rivers and the bassist Dave Holland.) The first half of this birthday concert will feature a new trio, 3dom Factor, with Jon Irabagon on tenor saxophone and Joe Fonda on bass.

The band — Reid Anderson on bass, Ethan Iverson on piano, David King on drums — can often sound impatient to greet the future, even as it basks in nostalgic reflection. A good fit, in other words, for a run that began on New Year’s Eve.

At 7 and 9 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover, with varying minimums.

(Chinen)Joey DeFrancesco Plays Miles Davis and John Coltrane (Friday through Sunday) The Hammond B-3 organ doesn’t have a more soulful or effective evangelist than Joey DeFrancesco, who turns his repertory attentions here to Miles Davis (with whom he briefly toured, as a teenager) and John Coltrane (a hero of his hometown, Philadelphia). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35, $40 on Saturday, $15 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum; some sets are sold out.

(Chinen)★ Kurt Elling (Tuesday through Jan. 12) A nimble and peripatetic jazz singer, Mr. Elling has always had his romantic side, and his most recent album, “1619 Broadway: The Brill Building Project” (Concord), gives him license to air it out in the service of revisionary pop nostalgia. The album is his repertory tribute to golden-era songwriting teams like Leiber and Stoller, with arrangements that often tone down the sweetness and slow the beat to a thoughtful crawl. It features the same core band found here, led by the pianist Laurence Hobgood, the Bill Miller to Mr. Elling’s Frank Sinatra. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 cover, with a $10 minimum.

On Saturday she works with Thumbscrew, her aggressively interactive trio with Mr. Fujiwara and the bassist Michael Formanek. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Donald Harrison, Ron Carter and Billy Cobham Trio (Tuesday through next Friday) Mr. Harrison, a soulful and sure-footed alto saxophonist from New Orleans, regroups the A-list rhythm section from a 2004 album of his, meaningfully titled “Heroes” (Nagel Heyer). Mr. Carter is on bass, and Mr. Cobham is on drums; both have earned their heroic stature, though that doesn’t mean they should be coasting here. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)★ Fred Hersch Trio  (Tuesday through Jan. 13) The unfalteringly elegant jazz pianist Fred Hersch has recorded worthwhile albums at the Village Vanguard before, and his latest — “Alive at the Vanguard,” a two-CD set recorded in February and released on Palmetto — chronicles an especially strong engagement by his current trio with the drummer Eric McPherson and the bassist John Hébert. The same crew returns to the same room next week. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum.

The band has a residency here, playing the second Tuesday of each month. At 7 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (347) 422-0248, barbesbrooklyn.com; suggested donation, $10. (Chinen)Lion Mouth / Max Johnson Trio (Monday) The assertive but tactful young cornetist Kirk Knuffke forms a connective thread between the two groups on this double bill. Lion Mouth, playing at 9:30 p.m., finds him in a combo with the pianist Jesse Stacken, the bassist Simon Jermyn and the drummer Jeff Davis (who has a tune called “Lion Mouth” on his most recent album). And the Max Johnson Trio, which plays a preceding set at 8:30, draws from its recent debut, “Elevated Vegetation” (FMR), featuring Mr. Knuffke, Max Johnson on bass and Ziv Ravitz on drums. At Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10.

Her working band, which seeks a folkloric flexibility, typically has Liam Robinson on accordion and piano, Chris Tordini on bass and Jordan Perlson on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $15 cover. (Chinen)Sachal Vasandani (Tuesday and Wednesday) With each of his three albums on the Mack Avenue label — the most recent being “Hi-Fly,” released in 2011 — Mr. Vasandani has made his case for a limber, pop-literate, semi-confessional strain of modern jazz singing. He’s a musically astute frontman, and here he connects with the guitarist Camila Meza, the bassist Buster Hemphill, the drummer Nate Smith and one of two excellent young pianists: either Gerald Clayton (on Tuesday) or Fabian Almazon (on Wednesday). At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)★ David S. Ware Memorial Service  (Monday) David S. Ware, who died in October at 62, was a saxophonist of volcanic energies and searching temperament, and a pillar of conviction in the post-1960s jazz avant-garde. His memorial will include musical tributes by the bassist William Parker, the drummer Guillermo E. Brown and the pianist Matthew Shipp, who’ll play his compositions as a trio; the drummer Andrew Cyrille, the multireedist and trumpeter Daniel Carter and the guitarist and bassist Joe Morris, who’ll form another trio; the multi-instrumentalist Cooper Moore, in a solo harp meditation; and the drummer Muhammad Ali and the saxophonist Darius Jones, in duologue. At 7:30 p.m., St. Peter’s Lutheran Church, Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-2200, saintpeters.org; free. (Chinen) Dan Weiss Percussion Fest (Tuesday through Thursday) Dan Weiss is a drummer of adaptable flow and microscopic focus, as he has shown in a range of instrumental settings. He has guest programmed three nights of percussive expedition, beginning on Tuesday with a set featuring his well-honed duo with the guitarist Miles Okazaki. On Wednesday the unswervingly in-the-moment drummer Tyshawn Sorey leads a trio with Yayoi Ikawa on piano and Chris Tordini on bass; on Thursday the tabla master Samir Chatterjee, one of Mr. Weiss’s mentors, gives a solo performance. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Frank Wess Quintet: 91st Birthday Celebration (Friday and Saturday) Frank Wess, one of the few and the proud nonagenarians left in jazz, conveys a gentlemanly cool on tenor saxophone and a marvelous expressiveness on flute. His ensemble for this birthday engagement includes George Cables on piano, Roni Ben-Hur on guitar, Santi Debriano on bass and Victor Lewis on drums. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/arts/jayne-cortez-poet-and-performance-artist-dies-at-78.html,"Jayne Cortez, a poet and performance artist whose work was known for its visceral power, its political outrage and above all its sheer, propulsive musicality, died on Dec. 28 in Manhattan. She was 78.Her death, at Beth Israel Medical Center, was from heart failure, her son, the jazz drummer Denardo Coleman, said.One of the central figures of the Black Arts Movement — the cultural branch of the black power movement that flourished in the 1960s and ’70s — Ms. Cortez remained active for decades afterward, publishing a dozen volumes of poetry and releasing almost as many recordings, on which her verse was seamlessly combined with avant-garde music.She performed on prominent stages around the world, including, in New York, the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, the Museum of Modern Art and Carnegie Hall.Ms. Cortez’s work was beyond category by virtue of embodying so many categories simultaneously: written verse, African and African-American oral tradition, the discourse of political protest, and jazz and blues. Meant for the ear even more than for the eye, her words combine a hurtling immediacy with an incantatory orality.Starting in the 1960s, Ms. Cortez began performing her work to musical accompaniment. For the past three decades she toured and recorded with her own band, the Firespitters, whose members include her son, from her first marriage, to the saxophonist and composer Ornette Coleman.As performed, Ms. Cortez’s poems were not so much set to music as they were a part of the music. They were chanted more than recited, employing carefully calibrated repetitions, shifts in tempo and modulations of vocal tone.It was as if her verse, which often took on large, painful subjects like racism and misogyny, had become an instrument itself — an instrument, Ms. Cortez felt strongly, to be wielded in the service of social change.In one of her best-known works, “If the Drum Is a Woman,” for instance, she indicts violence against women. (The title invokes Duke Ellington’s 1956 composition “A Drum Is a Woman”):why are you pounding your drum into an insane babblewhy are you pistol-whipping your drum at dawnwhy are you shooting through the head of your drumand making a drum tragedy of drumsif the drum is a womandon’t abuse your drum don’t abuse your drumdon’t abuse your drumSallie Jayne Richardson, always called Jayne, was born on the Army base at Fort Huachuca, Ariz., on May 10, 1934. (The year of her birth is often misreported as 1936.) Her father was a career soldier who would serve in both world wars; her mother was a secretary.Reared in Los Angeles, young Jayne Richardson reveled in the jazz and Latin recordings that her parents collected. She studied art, music and drama in high school and later attended Compton Community College. She took the surname Cortez, the maiden name of her maternal grandmother, early in her artistic career.In the summers of 1963 and 1964, Ms. Cortez worked with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, registering black voters in Mississippi. It was this work as much as anything, she later said, that caused her to regard art and political action as an indivisible whole.She gave her first public poetry readings with the Watts Repertory Theater Company, a Los Angeles ensemble she founded in 1964. Ms. Cortez, who had homes in Manhattan and Dakar, Senegal, was also a founder of the Organization of Women Writers of Africa, established in 1991.Ms. Cortez’s marriage to Mr. Coleman ended in divorce in 1964, after 10 years. Besides her son, she is survived by her second husband, Melvin Edwards, a prominent sculptor whom she married in 1975; a sister, Shawn Smith; three stepdaughters, Ana, Margit and Allma Edwards; and a grandson.Her volumes of poetry, many illustrated by Mr. Edwards, include “Festivals and Funerals” (1971), “Coagulations” (1984) and “Jazz Fan Looks Back” (2002); her albums include “Everywhere Drums” (1990) and “Taking the Blues Back Home” (1996).Ms. Cortez, who taught at universities throughout the United States, including Rutgers, was among the artists featured — others include Amiri Baraka, Charles Bukowski, John Cage and Allen Ginsberg — in Ron Mann’s esteemed 1982 documentary film, “Poetry in Motion.”Despite her work’s eclecticism, Ms. Cortez was comfortable invoking a single genre to describe it, precisely because that genre was itself so encompassing.“Jazz isn’t just one type of music, it’s an umbrella that covers the history of black people from African drumming to field hollers and the blues,” she told The Weekly Journal, a black newspaper in Britain, in 1997. “In the sense that I also try to reflect the fullness of the black experience, I’m very much a jazz poet.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/arts/television/winter-brings-new-tv-shows-and-finales.html,"A full-fledged winter television season has been with us for at least four or five years, and it just keeps getting bigger. This year January alone will feature the debuts of more than 100 new series or new seasons of established shows.The coming months will include a new mystery series, “Banshee,” bearing the fingerprints of the “Six Feet Under” and “True Blood” creator Alan Ball; the move of “Cougar Town” to its new home at TBS; new seasons of fan favorites like “Girls,” “Justified” and “Community”; and the final episodes of two of the more entertaining shows on TV, “Fringe” and “30 Rock.”Here is a highly selective list of some of the winter’s more interesting arrivals (and departures). As always, dates are subject to change.BERING SEA GOLD (Season 2, Discovery, Friday) In Jack London’s day, Arctic adventure meant leaving family and friends behind. Now it means taking them along so you can yell at them on camera, a formula that worked well for this gold-dredging reality show in its first season.MERLIN (Season 5, Syfy, Friday) This BBC bromance enters its final season, with the wizard Merlin once again required to save King Arthur’s bacon.PORTLANDIA (Season 3, IFC, Friday) Carrie Brownstein and Fred Armisen return with more mildly amusing sketch comedy from the Pacific Northwest. An MTV gag in Episode 2 starring Kurt Loder, Tabitha Soren and Matt Pinfield — a dose of 40-something wish fulfillment — will get attention, but Mr. Armisen and Ms. Brownstein’s best creations are still Candace and Toni, the frightening proprietors of the feminist bookstore Women and Women First.CESAR MILLAN’S LEADER OF THE PACK (Nat Geo Wild, Saturday) Mr. Millan, formerly the dog whisperer, adds matchmaking to his résumé. Each week three humans compete to adopt a pup from Mr. Millan’s Dog Psychology Center in Miraflores, Spain.DOWNTON ABBEY (Season 3, PBS, Sunday) Shirley MacLaine, as Cora’s mother, and Tim Pigott-Smith, as an obstetrician, come aboard the “Downton” dreadnought. It may be impossible to avoid the spoilers coming out of Britain, where the third season has already been shown, but true fans should do their best.DECEPTION (NBC, Monday) Stretching the definition of “undercover,” a detective (Meagan Good) reintroduces herself to the wealthy family that employed her mother as a maid — so she can investigate the murder of a family member who was her friend. It’s the second show created by Liz Heldens, and no, the first was not “Revenge.” (It was the entertaining and short-lived “Mercy.”)SWITCHED AT BIRTH (Season 2, ABC Family, Monday) After an unusually protracted 30-episode first season, this complicated drama about teenage girls raised by the wrong families returns.THE ABOLITIONISTS (PBS, Tuesday) A three-part “American Experience” tells the stories of Frederick Douglass (played by Richard Brooks of the original “Law & Order” cast), John Brown, William Lloyd Garrison, Harriet Beecher Stowe and other antislavery crusaders.AFRICA (Discovery, Tuesday) The second-largest continent gets the deluxe nature-documentary treatment in a seven-episode series from the BBC’s famed Natural History Unit, maker of “Life,” “Frozen Planet,” “The Blue Planet” and other ecological opuses.COUGAR TOWN (Season 4, TBS, Tuesday) TV’s closest equivalent to an open bar, formerly at ABC, reopens on TBS with Courteney Cox’s Jules and Josh Hopkins’s Grayson newly married.THE EDUCATION OF MICHELLE RHEE (PBS, Tuesday) With Ms. Rhee’s memoir, “Radical: Fighting to Put Students First” due in February, “Frontline” looks at her controversial tenure as chancellor of public schools in Washington.JIMMY KIMMEL LIVE! (ABC, Tuesday) Mr. Kimmel’s late-night talk show moves to 11:35 p.m., forcing reporters accustomed to typing “Jay and Dave” to remember to type “Jay, Dave and Jimmy.”THE JOE SCHMO SHOW (Spike, Tuesday) While pondering why a TV network would revive a faked reality competition that lasted for two seasons in 2003-4, consider this: among the unknown actors who portrayed contestants in the show’s original run were Valerie Azlynn (“Sullivan & Son”), Natasha Leggero (“Are You There, Chelsea?”), Jon Huertas (“Castle”), David Hornsby (“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia”) and Kristen Wiig.JUSTIFIED (Season 4, FX, Tuesday) The laconic lawman Raylan Givens (Timothy Olyphant) and the charismatic criminal Boyd Crowder (Walton Goggins) continue their improbable friendship in the hills and hollers of Harlan County, Ky.SNOOKI AND JWOWW (Season 2, MTV, Tuesday) You might not think that either Nicole Polizzi (Snooki) or Jenni Farley (JWoww) needed supersizing, but now that “Jersey Shore” is history, the new season of this spinoff reality series is expanding from 30-minute to one-hour episodes.WASHINGTON HEIGHTS (MTV, Wednesday) Manhattan’s Dominican enclave is the location for a docu-reality series focusing on nine people who we’re told are (1) from the neighborhood and (2) best friends. It sounds like “In the Heights,” if all of that Broadway musical’s characters had been good-looking young people dreaming of careers in the arts, fashion or baseball.1600 PENN (NBC, Thursday) Bill Pullman is the president, and Josh Gad (“Book of Mormon”) his dim-bulb son, in this wacky-family sitcom set in the White House. (If this sounds familiar, it’s because NBC previewed the pilot episode in mid-December.)BANSHEE (Cinemax, Jan. 11) Antony Starr (“Rush”) plays a crook who takes on the identity of the murdered sheriff of the fictional Amish country town of Banshee, Pa., in this contemporary noir series. Alan Ball (“True Blood”) is an executive producer.GIRLS (Season 2, HBO, Jan. 13) What will Lena Dunham’s Hannah be eating when the second season of Ms. Dunham’s much lauded series begins? The menu so far: spaghetti when Season 1 opened, cake when it ended and birthday cake, while sitting naked on a toilet, in the opening skit of the Emmy Awards. (Following “Girls” on Jan. 13 is the Season 2 premiere of “Enlightened,” with Laura Dern.)SHAMELESS (Season 3, Showtime, Jan. 13) There’s a stark contrast between Showtime’s Sunday night schedule in the fall — “Dexter” and “Homeland” — and in the winter: “Shameless,” “House of Lies” (which begins Season 2 on Jan. 13) and “Californication” (Season 6). At least the channel has the self-awareness to label the winter lineup Sinful Sundays, though Soft-Core Sundays might be more accurate.THE CARRIE DIARIES (CW, Jan. 14) AnnaSophia Robb plays Carrie Bradshaw at 16, before she grew into Sarah Jessica Parker and, more crucially, before Darren Star and Michael Patrick King started writing her dialogue.CONTINUUM (Syfy, Jan. 14) The Canadian pipeline that has brought Syfy shows like “Sanctuary,” “Lost Girl” and the coming “Primeval: New World” is responsible for this series about a cop from the future (Rachel Nichols) chasing a group of terrorists who have fled from the year 2077 to our own time.SECOND GENERATION WAYANS (BET, Jan. 15) Damien Dante Wayans and Craig Wayans, a nephew and a cousin of the primary Wayans brothers, probably rank No. 7 and No. 8 in the family in acting credits. In this meta-sitcom they play fledgling producers trying to distinguish themselves from their better-known relations.AMERICAN IDOL (Season 12, Fox, Jan. 16) The country singer Keith Urban and the designated antagonists Mariah Carey and Nicki Minaj arrive, in another near-total makeover of the judging panel. And for the first time in seven years, “Idol” is not the defending prime-time ratings champion. But some things — namely Randy Jackson and Ryan Seacrest — never change.LEGIT (FX, Jan. 17) The Australian comedian Jim Jefferies stars in this sitcom in the “Curb Your Enthusiasm” and “Louie” vein, playing an Australian comedian named Jim who’s trying to make it in Los Angeles. The talented D J Qualls (Garth in “Supernatural”) plays a friend, Billy, with severe muscular dystrophy; in the pilot, Billy insists on losing his virginity, and Jim takes it as a challenge to help him.NEWSREADERS (Adult Swim, Jan. 17) Rob Corddry and David Wain, executive producers of the short-form medical-drama parody “Children’s Hospital,” are behind this spinoff series, a parody of TV newsmagazines.FRINGE (Fox, Jan. 18) The wild ride ends after five seasons and exactly 100 episodes. It’s a safe bet that Walter, Peter and Olivia will find a way to save our universe once again in this two-hour series finale.RIPPER STREET (BBC America, Jan. 19) Matthew Macfadyen (“MI-5”) and Jerome Flynn (“Game of Thrones”) play detectives trying to professionalize 19th-century policing in a series that combines the costume procedural (“Copper”) with the vogue for London’s East End (“Whitechapel,” “The Runaway,” “Call the Midwife”).THE FOLLOWING (Fox, Jan. 21) Kevin Bacon takes on his first regular TV role since a short stint on “Guiding Light” more than 30 years ago. He plays an F.B.I. profiler whose bête noire, an intellectual serial killer (James Purefoy) obsessed with Edgar Allan Poe, finds a way to keep killing from inside prison. The appealing cast includes Natalie Zea as the killer’s ex-wife, and Annie Parisse as an F.B.I. colleague.THE TASTE (ABC, Jan. 22) Anthony Bourdain’s post-“No Reservations” TV career begins in earnest with this cooking competition series, which he will host with Nigella Lawson.WILD THINGS WITH DOMINIC MONAGHAN (BBC America, Jan. 22) Mr. Monaghan, formerly of “Lost,” returns to the jungle — and the desert, and the mountains — for this educational adventure show, whose subjects will include Ecuadorean army ants, venomous Venezuelan centipedes and Namibian scorpions.RISE OF THE DRONES (PBS, Jan. 23) This episode of “Nova” promises to explore the technology that makes possible America’s deadly and mysterious military drone program.SPARTACUS: WAR OF THE DAMNED (Season 3, Starz, Jan. 25) Having survived the death of its original Spartacus, the Welsh actor Andy Whitfield, this sword-and-sandals-and-sex series will call it quits after this 10-episode season. Liam McIntyre returns as Spartacus, now the leader of 30,000 rebel slaves.BUILT (Style, Jan. 28) Or “Extremely Hot Home Makeover.” Five male models who know how to handle a hammer take on renovation projects. Sweat seems guaranteed.DALLAS (Season 2, TNT, Jan. 28) TV nostalgists will want to keep an eye on the listings in March for the episode including the funeral of J. R. Ewing, the Texas oilman played by Larry Hagman, who died in November while filming this second season.NIKKI & SARA LIVE (MTV, Jan. 29) Nikki Glaser and Sara Schaefer will film this weekly late-night (11 o’clock) comedy show live at MTV’s Times Square studios.THE AMERICANS (FX, Jan. 30) Shifting the sleeper-spy premise of “Homeland” to the 1980s, this drama stars Matthew Rhys and Keri Russell as K.G.B. agents living in suburban Washington and running a network of operatives and informants while keeping their identities hidden from the F.B.I. and their two young children. Margo Martindale, an Emmy Award winner for her role as a backwoods crime boss in “Justified,” appears here as the couple’s K.G.B. contact.30 ROCK (NBC, Jan. 31) Tina Fey’s sitcom signs off after seven seasons, after which many of us will forget everything about the show except Alec Baldwin’s funny and frightening performance as the tinny soul of NBC.DO NO HARM (NBC, Jan. 31) Steven Pasquale, best known as the dim and dogged firefighter Sean Garrity in “Rescue Me,” plays a neurosurgeon with a sociopathic alter ego in this “Jekyll and Hyde” update.BELLE’S (TV One, Feb. 1) The writer and producer Ed. Weinberger, a creator of “Taxi” and “The Cosby Show,” and the veteran actor Keith David lend their considerable experience to this new sitcom, which Mr. Weinberger created with Miguel A. Núñez Jr. Mr. David plays the widowed owner of a soul food restaurant.MONDAY MORNINGS (TNT, Feb. 4) David E. Kelley returns to the medical drama, a genre he left behind after “Chicago Hope” was canceled in 2000, and teams with Dr. Sanjay Gupta, making his debut as a producer and writer of fictional TV. Alfred Molina, Ving Rhames, Jamie Bamber, Jennifer Finnigan and Bill Irwin play surgeons at a Portland, Ore., hospital.SMASH (Season 2, NBC, Feb. 5) Much reviled but not all that badly rated, NBC’s theater district soap opera has survived its Season 1 tryout and is beefing up the Broadway credentials of its cast: Jeremy Jordan (“Bonnie and Clyde,” “Newsies”) takes on a regular role as an aspiring writer, and Jesse L. Martin (“Rent”) and Nikki Blonsky (“Hairspray”) have arcs as a director and an assistant. Another performer who can sing a little, Jennifer Hudson, has signed on for three episodes as a Broadway diva.COMMUNITY (Season 4, NBC, Feb. 7) It’s anyone’s guess what this new season of one of TV’s most charming comedies will look like, now that the series’s creator and showrunner, Dan Harmon, has left, along with a number of other producers and writers (as well as a regular cast member, Chevy Chase).TOUCH (Season 2, Fox, Feb. 8) Originally scheduled for October, this mystical drama starring Kiefer Sutherland and a variety of cellphones has been shunted to the winter and spring for a second 13-episode season.WALKING DEAD (AMC, Feb. 10) AMC’s cable ratings juggernaut will try to keep the momentum going when it returns for the second half of its third season.SOUTHLAND (Season 5, TNT, Feb. 13) The most underappreciated show in prime time gets another low-budget, 10-episode winter season. C. Thomas Howell is promoted from guest star to regular, meaning more screen time for his loose-cannon character, Dewey Dudek.ZERO HOUR (ABC, Feb. 14) Anthony Edwards plays a professional skeptic — we know because he publishes a magazine called Modern Skeptic out of a loft in Brooklyn — who is pulled into a religio-science-fiction fantasy plot involving an antique clock, Nazis and the fate of humanity.CULT (CW, Feb. 19) Originally sold to WB, this mystery series has resurfaced six years later on that network’s successor. Matt Davis (formerly Alaric in “The Vampire Diaries”) plays a journalist investigating whether a series of disappearances is connected to a TV series called “Cult.” Robert Knepper (T-Bag in “Prison Break”) plays the lead actor in the show within the show.GOLDEN BOY (CBS, Feb. 26) Sixteen of CBS’s 22 prime-time hours last fall were devoted to crime. That makes it a little less odd that the network will now have two series centered on fictitious New York police commissioners: “Blue Bloods,” with Tom Selleck, and this new drama, with Theo James (star of the British horror series “Bedlam”) as the youngest commissioner in the city’s history. The pilot was written by Nicholas Wootton, a longtime writer and producer of “NYPD Blue.”ROBOT COMBAT LEAGUE (Syfy, Feb. 26) Mecha animation comes to life, as humans in exoskeleton suits control eight-foot-tall battling robots.BOSTON’S FINEST (TNT, Feb. 27) Perhaps feeling guilty that he plays a New York cop on CBS’s “Blue Bloods,” the Boston native Donnie Wahlberg is an executive producer of this reality series about the Boston Police Department.RED WIDOW (ABC, March 3) Last year ABC gave us a midseason series starring Ashley Judd as a soccer mom whose past as a C.I.A. operative returned to haunt her when her son was kidnapped (“Missing”).

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/arts/music/manfred-honeck-leads-new-york-philharmonic-at-avery-fisher.html,"Given the success that the Austrian-born conductor Manfred Honeck has had as music director of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, where he is now in his fifth season, it is surprising that it took until Thursday night for him to make his debut with the New York Philharmonic at Avery Fisher Hall. Yet for this career milestone appearance, Mr. Honeck stuck mainly to the staples.He began, however, with something of a novelty: a 10-minute suite from “Fantastic Apparitions on a Theme by Berlioz,” by the German composer Walter Braunfels, a colorfully orchestrated piece completed in 1917 that is drenched in the idiom of Richard Strauss. Then, joined by the brilliant French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet, Mr. Honeck offered a staple among staples: Grieg’s Piano Concerto, last heard from the Philharmonic just in May, when Alan Gilbert conducted a performance with the pianist Evgeny Kissin. After intermission Mr. Honeck turned to Beethoven’s Seventh Symphony, which David Zinman presented in a Philharmonic program last March.Clearly, Mr. Honeck’s way of trying to make an impression and stir excitement is to present familiar works in robust performances. This was his approach when he brought the Pittsburgh Symphony to Carnegie Hall in 2010, with a program consisting of Brahms’s Violin Concerto (with Anne-Sophie Mutter as soloist) and Mahler’s First Symphony.That Mahler performance with the Pittsburgh players was very good, and so was the Beethoven Seventh on Thursday with the Philharmonic. Still, other conductors have brought fresh perspectives to familiar works by programming them alongside new or recent pieces. Mr. Honeck has not been known as a particular champion of living composers.His appearance also raised questions about the New York Philharmonic’s artistic policy concerning guest conductors. Mr. Honeck naturally deserves some deference in selecting repertory. Yet, ideally, the appearance of a guest conductor, especially in a Philharmonic debut, should be an opportunity for some new thinking.As I said, Mr. Honeck led a stirring performance of the Beethoven Seventh. There was majesty, as well as subdued tension, in the slow opening of the first movement, which segued slyly into the Vivace main section, played with crisp execution and full-bodied sonorities. Mr. Honeck also brought a touch of nervous energy to the great Allegretto movement while still conveying its solemnity. He drew lithe and articulate playing from the Philharmonic in the dancing Presto movement and in the bustling finale, taken at a brisk but steady clip.This was a clearheaded and insightful reading of the score. But it hardly takes a major maestro to elicit an excellent performance of Beethoven’s Seventh from the impressive players of the Philharmonic.It is also hard for a pianist, or a conductor, to make a fresh impression in the Grieg Piano Concerto. Some pianists emphasize the work’s teeming Romanticism and episodic nature. Mr. Thibaudet did almost the opposite, playing with incisive rhythmic vigor and unmannered lyricism. There were moments, especially during the fast, whirling outbursts of the finale, when Mr. Thibaudet’s excitement got the better of him, and a passage came off rushed and sloppy. But this was a bracing account of the piece, supported all the way by Mr. Honeck and the Philharmonic players.Mr. Honeck received an ardent ovation at the end of the program. But what a timidly conventional Philharmonic debut."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/us/politics/owners-of-auto-racetracks-retain-a-tax-break.html,"WASHINGTON — In the rush to pass tax legislation, owners of auto racetracks scored a victory this week even as many other industries were left behind.With the help of devoted Nascar fans in Congress and lobbyists in Washington, track owners secured a one-year extension of an expiring tax break that allows them to write off investments in their property over 7 years, rather than the more typical 15 years.That break for speed racing and similar benefits granted to select businesses in the new tax deal will cost the Treasury tens of millions of dollars over the next decade, at the same time the government struggles with its growing debt.“This allows us to compete with football, baseball and basketball, whose facilities are often financed with state and local tax money,” said Daniel W. Houser, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the International Speedway Corporation of Daytona Beach, Fla., which owns and operates 13 auto racetracks. He said the tax provision would allow the company to carry out a “a robust capital spending plan.”Mr. Houser described the tax break as a form of economic stimulus. “We have shovel-ready projects that are ready to put people to work,” he said.Preservation of such tax breaks came as lawmakers said they were scouring the budget and the tax code for every dollar that could be saved. After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, federal debt is bumping up against the legal limit of $16.4 trillion.The tax break for “motorsports entertainment complexes,” a part of the tax bill signed Wednesday by President Obama, is estimated to cost $78 million over 10 years. It would cost more if it were extended again or made permanent, as the industry wants. By contrast, Congress sliced billions of dollars from hospitals and other health care providers.A few years ago, enthusiasm for motor sports soared, but in recent years Nascar and others like the IndyCar Series have struggled. The recession crimped the wallets of Nascar’s typically middle-aged, working-class fan base.The auto racetrack provision was one of many business tax breaks extended by Congress. Others continue tax incentives for film and television productions and for railroad track maintenance. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, included the auto racetrack provision in a long list of “special interest giveaways.”But supporters said it was justified, even at a time of big budget deficits. “This tax provision is a job creator,” said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and co-chairman of the Congressional Motorsports Caucus.Nascar, based in Daytona Beach and controlled by the France family, has an influential voice in Washington. Its employees made $347,400 in campaign contributions in the 2012 cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, a site that tracks campaign donations.Marcus Jadotte, a vice president of Nascar, said that while his company did not represent racetracks directly affected by the legislation, “we support the efforts of Congress to preserve the same tax treatment that motorsports facilities have been operating under for decades.”International Speedway, the Nascar sister company that owns and operates racetracks, derives 90 percent of its revenue from Nascar events.Mr. Houser said the tax break could also benefit hundreds of racetracks owned by other companies like Speedway Motorsports and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Nascar and International Speedway are members of the National Motorsports Coalition, which lobbied for the tax break in meetings with lawmakers.Wayne Allard, a Republican former senator from Colorado who is now vice president for government relations at the American Motorcyclist Association, a member of the coalition, said that membership and interest in the association had waned, with the group now running about 3,000 events a year, down from 4,000. The tax break, besides encouraging physical improvements at tracks and creating jobs, could help “prop up our membership,” he said.Among those who lobbied for the tax break was John F. Kelly Jr. of Cornerstone Government Affairs, a Capitol Hill firm that represents International Speedway. Mr. Kelly was a tax policy adviser at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush and then director of federal relations for Walmart.With passage of the tax bill, Mr. Kelly and his firm also won a victory for another client, Beam Inc., whose Cruzan rum is distilled in the United States Virgin Islands. The new law continues an arrangement under which federal excise taxes on imported rum are shared with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The territories have used the money to promote and assist the rum industry and to finance economic development projects.The tax break in the new federal law closely resembles the language of racetrack tax bills introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, home to the auto industry and the Michigan International Speedway; Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, home of the Daytona International Speedway; and Dean Heller, a Republican senator and former representative from Nevada, home of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.Among the co-sponsors, or chief backers, were Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, home of the Kansas Speedway, and the senators from North Carolina, home base for many race teams and the Nascar industry — Richard M. Burr, a Republican, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat.Also supporting the legislation was Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, whose love for the sport earned him the nickname Mr. Nascar. Mr. Kyl, who just retired from Congress, used to volunteer at the Phoenix International Raceway.Ms. Stabenow’s Web site includes pictures of her at a Nascar race at the Michigan track in August.But Cullen Schwarz, a spokesman for Ms. Stabenow, said of the tax break: “This is not a special deal for Nascar. It’s for racetrack companies. It keeps them on a seven-year depreciation schedule, the same as other entertainment venues with major capital expenditures like amusement parks.”Nascar, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was founded by Bill France Sr. in December 1947, and the family continues to own and operate the business today. His son, Bill Jr., was head of Nascar until 2000, and currently, Bill France Sr.’s grandson, Brian France, is Nascar’s chairman and chief executive. Brian’s sister, Lesa France Kennedy, serves on Nascar’s board and is the chief executive of the International Speedway Corporation.Brian France and Lesa France Kennedy have held fund-raisers for Mr. Buchanan at the Daytona speedway and have become regular donors to Republican and Democratic campaigns.In Charlotte, N.C., in August, Mr. France and several team owners held a fund-raiser for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, who had stirred a political fuss by saying he had “some great friends that are Nascar team owners.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/arts/television/whats-on-saturday.html,"8 P.M. (HBO) THE THREE STOOGES (2012) Will Sasso stars as Curly, Sean Hayes is Larry, and Chris Diamantopoulos is Moe (pictured above, from left) in this fictionalized origin story for the mostly lovable fools, and paean to the art of the eye poke, from Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Divided into “episodes,” the tale follows the Stooges from infancy — when they’re tossed out of a speeding car at the feet of a nun, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David) — to adulthood, when they’re forced to try to save the orphanage in which they were reared from the faltering economy and other calamities. Jane Lynch plays the Mother Superior who sends them out into the world, where they meet a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) and her lover (Craig Bierko); the handsome guy from the Old Spice commercials (Isaiah Mustafa); and some of the cast of “Jersey Shore.” “The three leads in ‘The Three Stooges’ play dumb very well, particularly Mr. Sasso,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She added: “Much of the pleasure in ‘The Three Stooges’ comes from watching and hearing (the boings and thumps are terrific) grown men smack each other silly in Rube Goldberg-like formations and without suffering so much as a single black eye, enduring psychological damage or, as bad, being forced to change. Like Wile E. Coyote and those inflatable clowns that bounce back after every punch, the Three Stooges take plenty of hits but keep on coming. They are, as the Farrellys understand, testaments to human resilience, one slap and tickle at a time.”NOON (13) RICHARD HEFFNER’S OPEN MIND Eduardo Porter, who writes the Economic Scene column for The New York Times, discusses how Americans engaged in capitalism at the polls in November.5 P.M.

Ms. Streep plays the title character with a perfectionism that “has rarely seemed so apt,” A. O.

As they escape the confines of the Tokyo Hyatt, something like love ensues. Mr. Murray “supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at all,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times. “The corollary of this is that Ms. Coppola’s direction is so breezily assured in its awareness of loneliness that the film could potentially be dismissed as self-consciously moody rather than registering as a mood piece.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/theater/the-kitchen-dries-out-from-hurricane-sandy.html,"Tim Griffin was settling into his first full season in charge of the programming at the Kitchen theater and art gallery on West 19th Street in Chelsea, with hopes of re-establishing the space as an artists’ meeting place, when Hurricane Sandy flooded it with four feet of water from the Hudson River.The damage came to about $450,000. On the casualty list: lighting fixtures that had been taken down to accommodate the Richard Maxwell play “Neutral Hero”; speaker systems and electronics; and the theater’s stage, a Masonite and plywood sprung dance floor.“But we didn’t lose the piano,” said Mr. Griffin, the Kitchen’s executive director and chief curator. “The water came right up to the bed, right underneath it. But I think it, remarkably, stayed in tune.”The Kitchen was able to reopen by the end of November for a few performances of Mr. Maxwell’s play and a benefit auction, and now its schedule is back in full swing. An avant-garde music-theater production called “Inflatable Frankenstein” — a show by the ensemble Radiohole and P.S. 122 that is part of the Coil Festival — begins on Saturday, and “Untitled (disambiguation),” an exhibition of art works by Jacob Kassay, opens on Wednesday.Insurance is likely to cover less than half the loss from the storm. But grants from Time Warner and the Art Dealers Association of America, as well as from nonprofit organizations and foundations (like the Andy Warhol Foundation for the Visual Arts), have gone a long way toward making up the difference.“You’d be shocked to know how far we take the dollar,” Mr. Griffin said in a recent interview at a coffee shop near the Kitchen, which has a $2 million annual budget. “If you look at how many productions we have coming in and out, it’s startling.”From September 2011 to last July, that meant 52 projects (counting the openings of gallery shows, which usually run about six weeks, as well as theater, music or dance pieces) and 115 performances.With life back to a semblance of normality, Mr. Griffin is looking to get back on track the Kitchen’s new L.A.B. series (the letters stand for language, art, bodies), which addresses one of Mr. Griffin’s most cherished hopes for his tenure. The L.A.B. programs, which got under way in September, are interdisciplinary discussions that Mr. Griffin wants to host as free events two to four times a month.“The idea is to have people from different disciplines in a room at the same time,” Mr. Griffin explained, “discussing single words that have different meanings in different disciplines — hashing out the differences, in their respective contexts, and ideally, having them collaborate. I’m creating ambiguous events, at some level.”For the inaugural L.A.B. discussion, Mr. Griffin asked the author Lynne Tillman to speak about the concept of “presence” as part of a panel that also included the rhetorician Shannon Jackson, the choreographer Tere O’Connor and the visual artist Elad Lassry.“Tim recognizes the need for discussion about what we’re all making and seeing,” Ms. Tillman wrote in an e-mail, “and that discourse itself is a part of how we see and what we make.”The Kitchen was started in 1971 by Woody and Steina Vasulka in the kitchen of the Broadway Central Hotel in Greenwich Village as an exhibition and performance space for their fellow video artists.When the hotel collapsed in 1973, the Kitchen moved to SoHo, where it quickly became a headquarters for experimental music and early Minimalism, not least because the composer Rhys Chatham was appointed music director and brought in Steve Reich, Glenn Branca, Maryanne Amacher and other experimental composers.Another move, to its current location on 19th Street, just off 10th Avenue, in 1986, gave the Kitchen significantly more space. But there was a downside. In SoHo the Kitchen had become not only a thriving performance space, but a hangout as well. The move to Chelsea put it off the beaten path. Though it is less isolated now that Chelsea is a premier art world destination, the Kitchen has never quite regained that status.Mr. Griffin would like to change that, and he comes to the job with the experience to speak to different kinds of artists in their own languages. Now 42, he worked as a musician (he played trumpet in several ensembles), a theater producer and an art curator before taking a detour into journalism, first as the art editor at Time Out New York, then as the editor of Artforum for seven years.Mr. Lassry described Mr. Griffin as “quietly charismatic,” and added that under his leadership, the Kitchen has “this kind of looseness, where disciplines can meet without the conceptual compromise that often overwhelms interdisciplinary practice.”Mr. Griffin has said that running the Kitchen is similar, in some ways, to editing a magazine “in the sense that one tries to put different pieces together in a way that will amplify the meaning of any one piece, and make its potential meanings proliferate.”Mainly, he wants to turn the interdisciplinary exchanges of the L.A.B. programs into the dominant spirit at the Kitchen.“There’s a cross-disciplinary impulse in the arts now,” he said, “but I feel that very often, things get programmed from above.” He added, “What I’m trying to figure out here is, how do you create a special place where artists will want to come and hang out, and where they will happen to see things that aren’t immediately related to their own medium.“It would make an enormous impact if we could create a space where that kind of scene was real.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/asia/afghanistan-releases-detainees-ahead-of-trip-by-karzai-to-washington.html,"KABUL, Afghanistan — Just ahead of a trip to Washington by President Hamid Karzai, the Afghan government released 80 detainees on Friday, part of a continuing effort to assert its sovereignty over the contentious issue of how prisoners are handled.American officials have long complained that the Afghans release prisoners too soon, raising the risk that many will return to the battlefield. Afghan officials counter that they are not legally allowed to detain people suspected of being insurgents without enough evidence to prosecute them, even if the Americans say they are too dangerous to release.The releases stem from an agreement the Americans made to eventually transfer control of the Parwan Detention Facility, located at Bagram Air Base, to the Afghan government last March. Of the thousands of prisoners captured by American forces who have come under Afghan control, close to 1,000 have been released over the last year.But Friday was a rare instance when the government made a public spectacle of releasing a large number together. A large group of local television journalists lined up to film the ceremony, during which the prisoners, dressed in new brown, yellow and blue shalwars, embraced family members most had not seen in more than a year.“The Afghan government is not trying to open the gates of its prisons and release all prisoners,” said Gen. Ghulam Farooq, the superintendent of the Bagram Prison, which holds about 3,000 prisoners. “Those who are found guilty will be punished, but those who are innocent should be released.”But, he added, “we don’t know how many are guilty and how many are innocent,” a reference to the limited evidence that, Afghan officials contend, makes holding the prisoners impossible under Afghan law.Despite the government’s upbeat ceremony, the transfer of the prison has become a considerable source of tension as the Americans prepare to withdraw and Afghans take on increasing control over security in the country. The United States halted the transfer of a handful of detainees in September, arguing that the Afghan government had not held up its end of the deal. Two months later, Mr. Karzai ordered Afghan forces to take control of the American-built prison, although that has still not happened entirely.On Friday, General Farooq dismissed the notion that the release of the detainees was contentious, saying it was part of the plan all along.“The Afghan government and the Americans agreed that Americans would hand all prisoners to the Afghan government and that we would make a decision about keeping and releasing them based on the enforced laws of Afghanistan,” General Farooq said. “It is a 100 percent Afghan process, and the Americans don’t have any problem with it. They are not involved in it at all.”American officials have disputed the Afghan interpretation of the agreement to hand over the prison, arguing that the American military authorities have veto power over who is released. To date, Americans have not transferred all of the Afghan prisoners they are holding to government control. In addition, newly captured Afghan prisoners are being kept in American custody, a procedure the Afghans have disputed.In the last year, 570 detainees have been released after acquittal in Afghan courts. An additional 485 are in the process of being released, or have been released already, after a bilateral board of Afghans and Americans determined that there was not enough evidence to prosecute them. On Saturday, the government expects to release 131 more prisoners.Some Western officials believe that the move by the Afghan government is designed to encourage reconciliation with insurgents to help put an end to the war. And by timing the move on the day before Mr. Karzai leaves for Washington to visit President Obama, it also highlights his independence as a leader.“The main reason behind the release of these prisoners is to show the good intentions of the Afghan government,” General Farooq said. “We hope that their release will strengthen peace and stability in the country.”Judging by the response of families and friends of the prisoners, the government’s move was well calculated.“The release of these prisoners will definitely have a positive impact on people’s relationship with the government,” said Haji Sangeen, 48, a truck driver from Paktia who came to collect 12 of the detainees who hailed from his village. “It will bring the distance between the government and people to a minimum.”The released prisoners, for their part, were pleased with the result, if not their detention.Mohammed Naib, 15, from Logar Province, said he was arrested during a night raid at his school when he was just 13.“How would you feel if someone put you in jail for two years without even telling why they have arrested you,” he asked. “ I am happy that they have decided to release us, but my rights have been disregarded. Even if they give me the entire world they won’t be able to restore my dignity.”After the ceremony, the prisoners and their relatives went to a pink mosque nearby for lunch. They gathered in groups, chatting with one another and laughing, an air of jubilance filling the room. Some of the relatives started calling family members of the prisoners and handing the phones over to them to talk.Abdullah, 32, also from Logar, said that he was arrested with his two brothers during a night raid about 20 months ago.“They arrested me because I was the imam of our mosque, and they accused me of harboring insurgents,” he said. “But they couldn’t prove it.”Like most other released detainees, Abdullah, who uses a single name, denied ever having aided the Taliban.“I am not going to join the Taliban because I do not see a reason for that,” he said. “I will try to live a normal life, but I will not support the government or American efforts because I do not see a reason for that either.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/movies/digital-technology-is-making-its-mark-in-cuba.html,"HAVANA — Sebastián Miló barely had enough money to put gasoline in the aged bus that ferried his crew to the set each day, let alone to pay actors a salary.But Mr. Miló, a 33-year-old Cuban filmmaker, had a Canon 5D digital camera and a story to tell. So, during one frenetic week in May 2011, he shot “Truckdriver,” a tense 25-minute film about bullying at one of the vaunted rural boarding schools where millions of Cubans used to spend part of their high school education.“It was something I went through myself, and so did many people I know,” said Mr. Miló, referring to incidents of bullying that dogged him at school and, later, during military service. “The subject struck a chord.”Mr. Miló is one of hundreds of Cuban filmmakers who, armed with digital technology, are laying the foundations of an independent movie industry outside the state apparatus that has defined Cuban cinema for much of the Castro era — and still, much to the frustration of some filmmakers, controls access to the island’s movie theaters.Around the country, Cubans are making features, shorts, documentaries and animated works, often with little more than a couple of friends and some inexpensive equipment — and little input from the state-supported Cuban Institute of Cinematic Art and Industry.Mr. Miló, who received about $10,000 in financing from a Spanish production company, Idunnu Music and Visual Arts, said that the crew and actors worked for next to nothing. “They said they felt strongly about what the film was saying,” he said.The global boom in digital filmmaking has rippled across Cuba over the past decade, letting filmmakers create their work beyond the oversight of state-financed institutions. Independent movies have become a new means of expression in a country where, despite freedoms and economic reforms introduced by President Raul Castro since 2006, the state still carefully controls national press, television and radio, and access to the Internet is very limited.While there is no official tally of independent movies, they have gained prominence on the national scene. They dominate the Cuban offerings at the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema in Havana and scored a new level of commercial visibility last year with “Juan of the Dead,” a zombie movie that was released in several countries, including the United States.“They’re bringing fresh ideas; they’re experimenting,” said Javier Ernesto Alejándrez, 21, a humanities student waiting in line last month to see the independent feature “Pablo,” shown as part of the film festival.“There’s a lot of creativity, and they are really thinking about stuff,” said Alexandra Halkin, the director of the Americas Media Initiative, a nonprofit group that distributes and promotes Cuban film overseas. “They just need more tools and more space.”For decades, the film institute was an important tool of the government’s program to educate Cubans and build a national narrative under the Communist system, annually producing dozens of documentaries and features and nurturing acclaimed directors, including Tomás Gutiérrez Alea (known as Titon), Humberto Solás and Fernando Pérez. The institute’s financing plummeted after the Soviet Union collapsed, and it now relies on foreign sources to produce a handful of features each year.The explosion of independent film has yielded an uneven jumble of movies that draw on genres eschewed by the establishment — like thrillers and horror — and that offer raw depictions or biting satire about the darker side of life on the island.Miguel Coyula, whose surreal, fragmentary feature “Memories of Overdevelopment” was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010, said that while no specific trend had emerged, there was a greater willingness to tackle riskier and risqué subjects — even Fidel Castro — and document issues not covered by the official press.Some movies offer a glimmer of a promising new generation, experts and filmmakers say, citing the experimental documentaries of Marcel Beltrán and Armando Capó, which will be included in a program at the Museum of Modern Art in February; Victor Alfonso’s humorous animated shorts about a high school nerd; Carlos Machado Quintela’s feature-length movie “The Swimming Pool,” about a group of physically disabled children and their swimming instructor; and the work of more established practitioners like Mr. Coyula and Esteban Insausti, whose work has been screened at many foreign festivals, including Cannes.Carlos Lechuga, 29, whose debut feature film, “Melaza” (“Molasses”), tells a story of social degradation in a sugar town whose mill has been shuttered, said that independent movies were nourishing a conversation among Cubans keen to see the hard realities of their lives dealt with on screen.But even with the technology much more accessible, filmmakers must struggle to get their work seen. The film institute controls Cuba’s theaters; Internet access remains rare, expensive and too slow for downloading movies. Instead, Cubans pass around DVDs.Karel Ducasse, for example, has made about 500 copies of his 2007 documentary, “Zone of Silence,” which is about censorship, to sell and hand out at festivals. He believes the problems with distribution are no accident.“The state has become afraid of digital media,” he said. “They know anything can be passed around the island.”Aside from longing for better distribution, Cuban producers are anxious for regulations that would let them establish private production companies and seek permits without going through the film institute, whose bureaucracy eats into meager budgets.Dozens of small production companies have sprouted in recent years, offering camera-rental services and help with permits and logistics, but they have no legal status.“Look at what countries like Colombia have done in recent years to attract filmmaking,” said Claudia Calviño of Producciones de la 5ta Avenida, which made “Melaza” in production with French and Panamanian financing. She was referring to a Colombian law that offers movie producers rebates of 20 to 40 percent of the cost of production services, catering, accommodation and transportation. “Cuba must do this. We need laws, we need mechanisms.” The institute has opened up to independent cinema, establishing an annual festival of work by filmmakers younger than 35, and supporting independent productions with props and permits. But the institute remains a bureaucratic leviathan that even its founder, Alfredo Guevara, considers obsolete.“I designed the organization, but I say, ‘It doesn’t work anymore,’ ” said Mr. Guevara, who left the institute 12 years ago and is president of the Havana film festival. Mr. Guevara said he believed the institute should stop producing films and be limited to, say, renting out sets and distributing movies.There are also limits to the institute’s openness: after helping with production permits and other logistics for “Melaza,” institute officials — apparently nervous about the film’s critical tone — demanded that its name be removed from the credits, according to three people involved in the production who spoke on condition of anonymity because they wished to preserve good relations with the institute. Officials at the institute could not be reached for comment.Mr. Guevara said that he believed that the state would slowly adapt to the reality of an independent industry, and that Cuban cinema could one day recover the luster of movies like Mr. Gutiérrez Alea’s “Memories of Underdevelopment” (Mr. Coyula’s film is a sequel) or the later “Strawberry and Chocolate,” and Mr. Solás’s “Lucia.”“A new generation will emerge,” he said. “There may not be another Titon, another Humberto Solas.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/us/politics/obama-could-name-chuck-hagel-to-defense-post-next-week.html,"WASHINGTON — Chuck Hagel appears to have weathered a concerted and vocal campaign to derail his chances for defense secretary, with President Obama likely to nominate him as early as next week, administration and Congressional officials said Friday.Since Mr. Hagel’s name emerged as a candidate for the Pentagon in early December, conservatives, pro-Israel groups and gay rights organizations have raised objections to his views on Israel and Iran, as well as disparaging comments he made about a gay former diplomat.Administration officials cautioned that Mr. Obama has not made a final decision or offered Mr. Hagel the job. But people on Capitol Hill who know Mr. Hagel, a former Republican senator from Nebraska, have said that all signs were pointing to his selection.In an interview with NBC’s “Meet the Press” last month, Mr. Obama defended Mr. Hagel from the criticism, saying that while he had not decided on a defense secretary, Mr. Hagel was a “patriot” and that nothing in his record would disqualify him for the job.The president could announce the selection as early as Monday, officials said, after returning from a vacation in Hawaii. That would come days before a visit to Washington by President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan, during which he and Mr. Obama are expected to discuss options for American troop withdrawals from Afghanistan.Mr. Hagel, should he be named by Mr. Obama, will most likely be comfortable with what Pentagon officials say is a White House desire to draw down the remaining 66,000 troops as quickly as conditions allow.“One of the reasons we’re in trouble in Afghanistan is because we went well beyond our mission,” Mr. Hagel told Robert Nolan, an editor and television producer, in May 2012 for a PBS series on foreign policy. “And now, 12 years later, we’re not sure what our mission is.”Critics faulted Mr. Hagel for referring to pro-Israel lobbying groups as the “Jewish lobby,” and said he offered inadequate support for Israel and was soft on Iran. He apologized last month for saying 14 years ago that President Bill Clinton’s nominee for ambassador to Luxembourg, James C. Hormel, was not qualified because he was “openly, aggressively gay.”But Mr. Hagel has influential defenders. “He has a very sound, thoughtful mind,” said Brent Scowcroft, a longtime friend and the national security adviser in the administration of the elder President George Bush.Mr. Hagel is the second rumored cabinet nominee to encounter fierce resistance. Susan E. Rice, the ambassador to the United Nations, withdrew her name from consideration for secretary of state after Republican lawmakers vowed to block her nomination because of statements she made after the deadly attack on the American mission in Benghazi, Libya.Mr. Obama instead named Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, to replace Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is expected to step down."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/movies/the-new-yawk-new-wave-series-at-film-forum.html,"THE past 20 years or so have turned indie filmmaking into a brand as much as an ethos, and one side effect has been a certain amnesia. Long before indie became the trademark of a festival in Utah (much less a term at times as contentious as hipster), a revolution in cinema occurred on several fronts in New York. Shot on location, often on meager budgets, these films tapped into the city’s cultural and social energies: its streets, its people, its artistic fervor.But this wasn’t the 1990s, or even the ’80s — more along the lines of Eisenhower or Kennedy.Released in 1953, “Little Fugitive,” for example, was a feature directed by the photographers turned filmmakers Morris Engel and his wife, Ruth Orkin, and Ray Ashley. Perhaps the granddaddy of the independents, shot on a hand-held, modified 35-millimeter camera, it follows a boy run amok in Brooklyn who has been tricked into thinking he has shot his brother.Only a few years later, the actor turned filmmaker John Cassavetes’s debut feature, “Shadows,” drew on a mostly nonprofessional cast and the verve of jazz for its stories of interracial romance and just hanging out. Not long after, “The Connection,” by Shirley Clarke, brought to the screen Jack Gelber’s 1959 play about heroin users, with its addict’s sense of dead time and Beat-inflected theatrics.These three films — all landmarks — are only part of the independent craft on display in a sprawling series opening at Film Forum this week. Gathering over 50 restless films under one roof, “New Yawk New Wave” focuses on the fertile span from 1953 (“Little Fugitive”) to 1973, when Martin Scorsese’s independently produced “Mean Streets” was distributed by Warner Brothers.The selection is multifaceted. Here are Brian De Palma’s pre-“Carrie” counterculture trips “Hi, Mom!” and “Greetings,” starring a young Robert De Niro; the smart-aleck culture jam “Putney Swope” of Robert Downey (father of Hollywood’s Iron Man); and the first feature by the avant-garde godfather and exhibitor Jonas Mekas, a founder of the movement called the New American Cinema.Clarke’s “Connection” rubs shoulders with Lionel Rogosin’s skid-row exposé, “On the Bowery,” while in D. A. Pennebaker’s “Jingle Bells” and Robert Drew and Hope Ryden’s “Jane,” Robert F. Kennedy and Jane Fonda go about their business under the eye of cinéma vérité pioneers.You’ll also find a double bill of differently suspenseful subway thrillers (“Dutchman,” written by Amiri Baraka, and “The Incident,” starring Martin Sheen and the future spaghetti western star Tony Musante), work by the Warhol associate Paul Morrissey and the underground mainstays Kenneth Anger and Mike and George Kuchar, not to mention one of the novelist Norman Mailer’s forays into no-holds-barred filmmaking, “Maidstone” (in which he wrestles with Rip Torn).Astonishingly, most of these films came out in one 10-year period and traded crosscurrents with booms across the Atlantic, like the French New Wave and the earlier Italian neorealism.“What struck me regarding ‘Little Fugitive’ was that Truffaut credited it with inspiring the French New Wave,” the critic J. Hoberman, who conceived the series, said in a phone interview. He advised Film Forum’s director of repertory programming, Bruce Goldstein, in charting the “parallel tradition” in the lineup: New York’s alternatives to Hollywood’s studio productions.Truffaut wasn’t the only Frenchman curious about “Little Fugitive.” Jean-Luc Godard wrote Engel that his cinematographer, Raoul Coutard, would be getting in touch to “have a look at your camera from his technical point of you.”The practical problem of designing mobile cameras was also very much on the mind of Mr. Drew. The documentarian shared the notion that a fresher take on reality was yet to be discovered.“I was at Life magazine producing picture stories, and I wondered why documentaries on television were dull,” recalled Mr. Drew, who calls Engel a genius, in a phone interview. “I had no doubt we could make a lighter camera, and I started with that premise and started finding people who could do that.” He recruited Richard Leacock, who in turn brought on Mr. Pennebaker. A camera engineer named Mitchell Bogdanowicz ultimately hit upon the plastic gears that made the cameras run quietly.The immediacy of cinéma vérité was not the only model for capturing spontaneous moments on film. Jazz improvisation and the theater were also inspirations in a city that was home to countless thriving clubs as well as the experiments of the Living Theater and the Actors Studio.Cassavetes’s “Shadows” features music performed by Charles Mingus and Shafi Hadi, but also an infectiously freewheeling sense of filmmaking and desire to tap into the moment. Clarke’s theater adaptation, “The Connection,” draws on the bop of Freddie Redd’s quartet, while “The Cool World” features a score by Mal Waldron recorded by Dizzy Gillespie. Herbert Danska’s 1966 film “Sweet Love, Bitter,” also in the series, tells the story of a saxophonist modeled on Charlie Parker, and played by Dick Gregory.Besides capturing the city’s sound, these New York filmmakers also wanted to get its lived-in look, not the anonymous classy or brassy hustle and bustle of so many Hollywood studio films. “Little Fugitive,” which receives a weeklong run at the end of the series, takes us to Brooklyn tenements and the carousel on Coney Island. Michael Roemer’s deadpan 1969 classic about an ex-con outmatched in the catering business, “The Plot Against Harry,” was purposely shot across Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx without regard to landmarks.Clarke’s “Cool World” is widely regarded as the first fiction feature shot entirely on location in Harlem. The director’s star, Rony Clanton, was discovered working at a church at 14 by Clarke’s collaborator the actor Carl Lee.“Shirley Clarke said, ‘Why don’t you act out a gang fight?’ ” Mr. Clanton, who appears on “Boardwalk Empire,” recalled of the audition. “I was a Boy Scout, but I knew about the streets.”The series supplements the era’s location shoots with street scenes captured across decades in shorts by the likes of the photographers Rudy Burckhardt, Paul Strand, Helen Levitt and even Robert Flaherty. But not all of the action was outdoors: Milton Moses Ginsberg’s 1969 psychosexual study “Coming Apart,” starring Mr. Torn, takes place inside a Kips Bay apartment. Our point of view is the secret camera Mr. Torn’s character has installed in a mirrored objet d’art to film his arguments and escapades.One of the great pleasures and insights of Film Forum’s smorgasbord is seeing sensibilities influencing one another. Before directing his feature Mr. Ginsberg did sound work for Robert Frank, also featured in the series, and he credits Jim McBride’s 1967 “David Holzman’s Diary” and its self-conscious approach as an inspiration for “Coming Apart.”“Diary” presents the audience with a callow filmmaker trying to make art of life, and annoying his girlfriend and others around him in the process. Before becoming a director Mr. McBride wrote a monograph on cinéma vérité for the Museum of Modern Art with the film’s star, L. M. Kit Carson. They interviewed Mr. Pennebaker, Albert Maysles, Andy Warhol and others, and became inspired by the seductive practice of shooting live situations.“They forget sometimes that the truth lies,” Mr. McBride said. “And somehow thinking about all those kinds of things, we thought about a guy making the film he thought would tell the truth.”Mr. McBride’s debut came out the same year as that of another filmmaker whose first features lead the series into the storied ’70s. With “Who’s That Knocking at My Door” and “Mean Streets.” Mr. Scorsese synthesized the disparate advances and energies of the New Yawk New Wave. The result was what Mr. Hoberman calls “a coherent package” that left its stamp on the New Hollywood and its paradigm shifts.Not, however, without the help of a little movie magic.“One of the ironic things about ‘Mean Streets’ is that it’s mainly shot in Los Angeles,” Mr. Hoberman pointed out. “But the New York stuff is so vivid that he’s really able to make it feel like it’s completely a New York film.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/movies/homevideo/new-dvds-buster-keaton-collection-the-jazz-singer.html,"ARRIVING a tad too late for holiday giving, Kino’s spectacular 14-disc “Buster Keaton Collection” nevertheless demands attention as an infinitely rewarding anthology of the major works of a major artist. Here is Keaton’s richest creative period, essentially intact: all 19 of the shorts he made as a star between 1920 and 1923, and all 11 of the silent features he made as an independent (including, for the first time on Blu-ray, the 1927 “College”).There are also two discs devoted to the sound shorts Keaton made for the Poverty Row studio Educational from 1934 to 1937 — not major work, but of interest to all Keaton enthusiasts as the last period of creative independence he would enjoy in his long career — as well as a storehouse of supplementary material, including the alternative European versions of “The Saphead” (1920) and “Steamboat Bill, Jr.” (1928), fascinating audio recordings of Keaton at work and extensive commentary and visual essays by a wide range of Keaton experts. About all that’s missing are the two final silent features, “The Cameraman” (1928) and “Spite Marriage” (1929), which are now part of the Warner Brothers library and continue to be available on another “Buster Keaton Collection” issued on DVD by Turner Classic Movies in 2004.It’s rare to find so much of a great filmmaker’s work gathered under one roof. What Kino has given us is the cinematic (near) equivalent of “The Oxford Shakespeare.” With the exception of “The Saphead,” an early work for hire that doesn’t reflect much personal involvement, Keaton’s films during this period form a tightly unified block. No matter whose name is on the credits as the director, it is clearly Keaton who is making the all-important decisions about camera placement and blocking. All these films take place in the same strangely symmetrical world of flat surfaces, ominous horizons and eerily multiplied objects.The movies speak to one another, through correspondences both major and minor. In “College,” for example, Keaton is the coxswain of a rowing team who manages to overturn and sink his crew’s boat. A close-up underlines the boat’s name, “Damfino,” which was also the name of the majestically sinking vessel in Keaton’s 1921 short “The Boat.”As we learn in a video essay by John Bengston, the great detective of silent film locations (“Silent Echoes: Discovering Early Hollywood Through the Films of Buster Keaton”), both scenes were shot at the same pier in Newport Beach, Calif. — an echo that certainly eluded audiences of the time but that now gives the gag in “College” a Keatonesque sense of repetition.The folks at Kino have distributed Keaton’s work on video since the days of VHS, and they’ve done well by him by systematically upgrading their product as new formats have come along, culminating, for the moment, with these high-definition Blu-ray releases. For library releases, though, Kino’s fine example is the exception rather than the rule, and although independent companies like Criterion, Shout! Factory, Olive Films and Twilight Time have been very good about moving classic titles onto Blu-ray, the studios have mostly lagged behind.Just as we lost a large number of older titles in the transition from VHS to DVD, it now seems clear that we will lose even more in the transition to high-definition formats. In this time of peril for home video the majors mostly seem reluctant to spend the money to remaster any but the most famous library films, a development that points toward a future in which only Oscar winners and box office champions will remain widely accessible, out of that huge and wonderful corpus that is the American cinema.Warner Home Video continues to stand out among the studio outlets doing exemplary work, with its Blu-ray upgrade of the superb three-disc edition of “The Jazz Singer” from 2007. Although the contents of the two editions are identical, the Blu-ray has a more satisfyingly filmlike feel, bringing out the tight grain of the meticulously restored image and making the movie look less like a battered antique and more like the bleeding-edge technological marvel that did much to advance the acceptance of talking films in 1927.The other two discs in the “Jazz Singer” portfolio are reprints of the standard DVDs from the 2007 collection, and largely consist of Vitaphone shorts assembled with the assistance of the early-sound scholar Ron Hutchinson. Introduced a year before “The Jazz Singer,” but employing the same sound-on-disc technology, these 10- to 20-minute records of popular vaudeville acts not only provide a fascinating record of the lost American variety stage but also were the principal means through which audiences gradually became accustomed to music and dialogue emerging from images that had for so long been expressively mute.Generally forgotten in discussions of “The Jazz Singer” is the film’s director, Alan Crosland. Too much of Crosland’s silent work has been lost to allow us to come to any real sense of his personality as a filmmaker, though he enjoyed enough prestige in the 1920s to be hired away from Paramount in 1925 by Warner Brothers, where he was assigned to John Barrymore, then the studio’s most important star. Crosland continued to direct Warner Brothers’ showcase films, including the all-singing, all-dancing, all-Technicolor musical “On With the Show!” in 1929.But it wasn’t long before his star began to slip, perhaps because his stately, deliberate style no longer harmonized with the high-speed delivery of sound films. By the mid-’30s he was directing borderline B pictures, like the Perry Mason film “The Case of the Howling Dog.” Warner Brothers has also released this week, on its Warner Archive burn-on-demand label, Crosland’s final film for the studio, an enjoyable but distinctly stagy murder mystery titled “The White Cockatoo.” His studio contract was not renewed, and Crosland moved to Universal, where he directed a handful of (currently unavailable) films before being killed in a car accident in 1936, just shy of his 42nd birthday.Another recent Warner Archive release, “Vitaphone Varieties Volume Two,” brings together another 35 newly restored Vitaphone shorts. Among the vaudeville and concert hall artists included are Edgar Bergen, Fred Allen, Fred Waring, Blanche Sweet, Bert Lahr, Pat O’Brien and Joe E. Brown, many of them caught between acts on Broadway and whisked away to be filmed in Warner Brothers’ Brooklyn sound studio. Still standing at 1277 East 14th Street, in the Midwood section, the former studio now houses the orthodox Shulamith School for Girls of Brooklyn.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/movies/sean-penn-in-ruben-fleischers-gangster-squad.html,"LOS ANGELESMICKEY COHEN would have no beef with the glowing digital billboards that have been splashing movie images on the streets here for a month.O.K., Sean Penn’s Cohen has thinner lips and no 5 o’clock shadow. But he’s got the scowl down pat.And the film’s title might have rubbed Cohen a little raw: “Gangster Squad.”He once called it the “stupidity squad” — a bunch of Los Angeles cops, he figured, who were too dumb to pin him with a real crime. So they would roust him outside his haberdashery on the Sunset Strip, or arrest him for using foul language, and couldn’t even make that two-bit rap stick.But Cohen — showman, gambler, gangster — would have been especially pleased to see his film doppelgänger looming above Wilshire Boulevard in West Los Angeles.That particular billboard is near the spot where Cohen wound up in 1949, on the night when gunmen ambushed him in his Brentwood driveway, and he escaped by careening through the usually quiet streets, crouched under the dashboard of his Cadillac with one hand on the wheel.He would have signed autographs, said Ruben Fleischer, who directed “Gangster Squad,” which features Mr. Penn as Cohen — battling felt-hatted cops played by Josh Brolin, Ryan Gosling and others — and is set for release by Warner Brothers on Friday. “He would have been thrilled to see a movie starring him had finally been made.”When Cohen, by then a relic, died in 1976, Mr. Fleischer was not yet 2 years old.But Mr. Fleischer has created the latest cinematic telling of the struggle between good and evil on the streets of Los Angeles, in a post-World War II era that was known for shady compromise between the two. James Ellroy wrote of the period’s corruption in the novel “L.A. Confidential,” which in 1997 became a film by Curtis Hanson. Warren Beatty played the criminally connected romantic lead in “Bugsy,” Barry Levinson’s 1991 film about Bugsy Siegel. And, as early as 1954, when the real-life stories were still unfolding, Jack Webb directed himself in the first “Dragnet” film, with help from some of those who pursued Cohen. To a point Mr. Fleischer and his collaborators — including the producer Dan Lin, who is a former Warner executive, and the writer Will Beall, an ex-homicide detective — follow that dark-tinted tradition.“Gangster Squad” is inspired by a newspaper series in which Paul Lieberman, writing for The Los Angeles Times in 2008, uncovered the gritty history of a real Gangster Squad. It was organized informally but later institutionalized under Police Chief William Parker as the Intelligence Division. Beginning in 1946 its members were detailed to root out mob influence in Southern California, often by extralegal means, including warrantless wiretaps and rough treatment of suspects in alleys or on hilltops above Hollywood.So the moral ambiguities are there. The heroes in this movie break the law now and then.But Mr. Fleischer and company have also tried for something new. Their Mickey Cohen is not the historical gangster who inflated his celebrity by displaying his pet’s doggy bed in Life magazine and ran a pathetic racket that involved raising money for a planned movie (never shot) about his own life.In “Gangster Squad” Cohen becomes mythic evil, a Batman villain. His victim is Los Angeles, a glamour doll of a metropolis that is being strangled, like Gotham City in “The Dark Knight” series. And it is saved, but also sullied, by tommy-gun-wielding cops in scenes violent enough that the film was delayed and somewhat revised after the mass killings at a theater in Aurora, Colo., last summer.“If we do this right, it’s a contemporary gangster movie,” Mr. Lin recalled thinking when he persuaded Warner Brothers to acquire Mr. Lieberman’s series four years ago.The project, he said, extended a process that began with “Sherlock Holmes,” a Warner Brothers film of which he was a producer. That 2009 movie used London of the Victorian-Edwardian years for a romp through old technologies, like radio, rebooted with contemporary cool.In the same spirit “Gangster Squad” became an experiment in next-wave noir.Soft-spoken and sandy-haired, Mr. Fleischer has made a career of showing up where he doesn’t quite belong.He grew up in Washington, and went to Wesleyan University, where, he recalled, he was rebuffed by Jeanine Basinger, chairwoman of a film studies program that has produced the likes of Michael Bay and Joss Whedon. “She wouldn’t even let me in a class,” Mr. Fleischer said last month, as he picked at hash browns with melted cheese in the nearly empty Pacific Dining Car, a restaurant that has been serving police officers, politicians and their news-media observers, as the sign says, “since 1921.”Upon graduating Mr. Fleischer moved in the late 1990s to San Francisco and bused tables. While the dot-com boom, which offered better job prospects, was then peaking, Mr. Fleischer had no computer training. So he bought a book, and taught himself to build Web sites. Before long he was building sites for big companies like Microsoft.That led to a Web-related job in Los Angeles, where he met Mike White, a filmmaker and television producer who had also attended Wesleyan and who got Mr. Fleischer hired as a production assistant on the TV series “Dawson’s Creek.”It was a short step to a job as assistant to the director Miguel Arteta, another member of Wesleyan’s movie mafia, on the film “Chuck & Buck,” starring and written by Mr. White.After making his own short and some videos (posted on his Web site), he began directing commercials for McDonalds and Nike. It was another business about which he knew little. Still, the commercials were a bridge to reality television and a series called “Rob & Big,” which he produced for MTV.In 2007 Mr. Fleischer was asked to take a look at the script for “Zombieland.” At the time he recalled, it was a failed television pilot — a horror-comedy mash-up that proved too expensive for the small screen. Because the script was meant to introduce a series, it had no real ending.Mr. Fleischer suggested turning it into a quest that culminated in a supposedly zombie-free amusement park. Bill Murray took a role as himself. Sony Pictures and Relativity Media backed the film, which starred Emma Stone, Jesse Eisenberg and Woody Harrelson, among others.And it hit big enough, with $102 million in worldwide ticket sales, that Mr. Fleischer again wound up where he felt he didn’t yet belong: on Hollywood’s list of big-budget directors.He was asked to consider directing an “X-Men” film, and “Mission: Impossible — Ghost Protocol.”“It felt like a hoax,” he said of one encounter that ended with his explaining to Tom Cruise that Mr. Fleischer wasn’t quite ready for “Mission: Impossible,” and Mr. Cruise’s expressing disappointment.But Mr. Fleischer backed away from the big films and made another small one, “30 Minutes or Less,” which starred Mr. Eisenberg, and had soft ticket sales when released by Sony last year.By then, however, Mr. Fleischer had already landed where he thought he should be: in charge of “Gangster Squad.”To say he pursued that assignment, Mr. Lin said, is an understatement: “He fought really hard.”Mr. Beall’s screenplay had already achieved celebrity status in Hollywood. In 2010 it made the Black List of best unproduced scripts. Ben Affleck and Darren Aronofsky flirted with the project, which became a priority at Warner Brothers, as Kevin McCormick, another former executive of the studio, joined Mr. Lin and Michael Tadross as a producer.Mr. Fleischer finally claimed the film, Mr. Lin said, by showing up with a visual presentation that captured the heightened reality of a film noir Los Angeles in which settings like the nightclub Slapsy Maxie’s could erupt with a glow to rival those digital billboards.Mr. Penn was quick to spot the bulldog quality behind Mr. Fleischer’s mild front. “He’s a gentleman and a stealth brute,” he said in a recent e-mail.Central to the movie’s look, and feel, were those tommy guns, which the squad carried, but seldom actually used, in real life.Mr. Brolin’s character is named for a real squad leader, John O’Mara, but he also incorporates traits of another member, Dick Williams. “He’d been a ranger in the South Pacific” who trained the young Marine Lee Marvin in jungle warfare, Williams’s son, Richard Williams, called Buz, said in an interview. When his father returned home, he gave the squad instruction in automatic weapons.The guns, however, put the film in jeopardy last summer. “Gangster Squad” was scheduled for release in September, until the mass shooting in July at a showing of Warner Brothers’ “Dark Knight Rises” in Aurora changed the plan — and the movie.A climactic sequence in Mr. Fleischer’s original version involved a shootout with machine guns in a movie theater. Ultimately that scene was replaced with a newly written confrontation between the squad and Cohen’s operatives in Chinatown.In the new scenes things explode, but the movie-theater gun violence is gone, and Mr. Fleischer, for one, does not miss it.“In some ways it’s better,” he said of the revised film. After all, he said, some adjoining scenes were “kind of tommy gun heavy.”The additions help distance “Gangster Squad” from a grim present reality that arose again in the Newtown, Conn., school shootings. But they also keep the film connected to a Hollywood tradition that requires good and bad to meet with a bang, however things may have occurred in life.In 1949, when the action in “Gangster Squad” takes place, Mr. Lieberman, the reporter, noted in a telephone interview, Warner Brothers released “White Heat,” the sort of gangster film that inspired Cohen, as he looked for a movie of his own.What we remember about “White Heat,” he pointed out, is not the connection between James Cagney’s Cody Jarrett and the real Barker gang. Rather, it is his fiery death in a cinematically necessary blaze of final glory.“No gangster ever exploded atop an oil refinery,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/arts/television/jim-jefferies-star-of-the-fx-series-legit.html,"IN “Legit,” a new comedy starting Jan. 17 on FX, the comedian Jim Jefferies plays himself as an agreeable lug bumbling through his life and relationships.The comic-gets-a-sitcom format is hardly groundbreaking, but “Everybody Loves Jim” this is not. The pilot revolves around a mission to procure a prostitute for a virginal, disabled sidekick. The episode opens with Mr. Jefferies fantasizing to another friend about impregnating a terminally ill woman: he wanted a child, but not a wife.“I liked the idea of starting off with a vicious joke just to set the tone a little bit,” he said. “But there’s fairly mushy stuff in it as well, so it’s a good balance.”The firmly TV-MA ethos of the show jibes with this iconoclastic comic’s act, which tends toward the graphic and irreverent. (One caustic riff on religion mocks the premise of reuniting with dead relatives in heaven: “Hello, uncle who used to touch me. How did you get up here? Oh, that’s right, you used to work for the church.”)But in conversation Mr. Jefferies, 35, is an affable sort with an easy laugh. A native of Sydney, Australia, he first found an audience for his comedy in Britain before moving to Los Angeles a few years ago. He has filled theaters in the United States since 2009 — when he boosted his profile with a popular HBO special, “I Swear to God” — and sold several series concepts along the way. But “Legit” is the first to make it to viewers.Mr. Jefferies called Jeremy Egner from the set to discuss the show and reveal why it’s hard to run over a cat, even on cable. These are excerpts from the conversation.Q. Stand-up comedy is a late-night profession. How are you adjusting to early-morning TV shoots?A. I’m getting used to it. I’ve also got a newborn baby, so I’m not getting much sleep. My girlfriend played the prostitute in the pilot. That’s how we met. So I’ll always get to look at my son and go, “When I met your mother, I employed her as a prostitute.”Q. That plot was taken from your act. Are all the episodes based on your stand-up?A. Most of them. There are a few other stories that are lifted straight from my life. At the moment we’re filming one about me putting a girl in a trunk of a car, which I’ve never told onstage, but it’s a true story. I had a one-night stand with a woman who was a celebrity who was still married. The paparazzi were out front, so I put her in the trunk of my car, and I drove around the corner thinking I’d let her out, but they followed me, so she was in there for about 40 minutes until I could find a friend with a garage.Q. Who was it?A. It was a British celebrity. But I’ve kept the secret all these years, and I’m not going to let it out now.Q. Your comedy is pretty pointed, but on TV you need a bit of likability to keep people invested, right?A. Also I’m playing myself. [Laughs] I’ve got to have some redeeming features.Q. How fictionalized is it?A. It’s more me five years ago than me today. This was pre-HBO special, when I was still playing smaller clubs. I do have a friend with muscular dystrophy who I did take to a brothel. I’m hoping that I’ve changed enough aspects of him that his mother won’t recognize him in the show.Q. The pilot seemed pretty unrestrained. How much oversight is FX giving you in general?A. Sometimes they go: “Don’t do this joke. Don’t do that joke.” We have an episode where a cat gets run over, and everyone panics about that. It turns out you can punch people, you can kill off a lead character in a violent way, you can say horrible things about people. But if you run over a cat or a dog, it better be really [expletive] funny."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/arts/television/the-joe-schmo-show-returns-to-spike.html,"WHAT does a cable channel do when it stumbles onto a show that attracts more enthusiasm than anything else it has produced, but the premise all but forecloses any hope that it can be brought back for new editions?If you are Spike TV, you sit back, wait for the attention to fade and quietly assemble a new version — 10 years later.And so on Tuesday comes the return of a series some fans of broad, raucous comedy have raised to the pantheon of recent television: “The Joe Schmo Show.”For those who have forgotten, or missed the original, “Schmo” was an ambitious, elaborate parody of reality shows, built around the conceit that a single contestant is asked to take part in outrageous stunts surrounded — unbeknown to him — by competitors who are all comedy actors.This time an achingly earnest young man named Chase Rogan (even his name sounds like a reality convention) enters what he believes is a competition, “The Full Bounty,” to win $100,000 and a full-time job in that most exalted of reality professions, bounty hunter. All Mr. Rogan needs to do to win is not discover that the whole thing is a put-on.Can he get past absurd tasks like trying to defuse a bomb based on instructions from a “deaf girl” whom he can’t understand? Can he accept a cast of characters that includes a former nude model, an ex-con, an absurdly muscled dude with a secret, a young woman with a hypercompetitive streak and, wildest of all, a down-on-his luck actor named Lorenzo Lamas, played by Lorenzo Lamas?And will he fail to recognize Ralph Garman, the original host of “Joe Schmo”? He’s back this time as Jake Montrose, bounty hunter extraordinaire, who guides the contestants through their ridiculous paces — all the while never wearing any article of clothing with sleeves.To make all this happen was a production months in the making and so secret that almost no one at Spike or its parent company, Viacom, could know that “Joe Schmo” was staging a comeback.Sharon Levy, executive vice president for original series for Spike, said the channel had for years noodled with the idea of reviving the series. “How would we do it?” she said. “When the idea for a bounty hunter show came up, we said: That’s it.”Ms. Levy spoke in an interview with some cast members and two producers, John Stevens and J. Holland Moore, who supervised the writing of the show. And written it is, despite its heavy reliance on improvisation.“We approach it like a sitcom,” Mr. Moore said. “We just don’t know what one character is going to do.”Casting that character, the schmo, was critical. Mr. Rogan was spotted in a gym near Pittsburgh, where he runs his own lawn company.“We’re looking for someone genuine,” Ms. Levy said. “Someone who chooses to believe. It’s purity. It’s an open heart.”She added, “It has to be that more than the word ‘gullible.’ ”Another crucial step was persuading Mr. Garman to reprise his central role. He was the host of both the original “Schmo” and a less-well-remembered sequel that included a Jane Schmo who caught on and had to be added to the cast. The original set records for Spike, with the finale reaching 3.8 million viewers.Mr. Garman, who hosts a top-rated radio show in Los Angeles, was reluctant. “I didn’t want to ruin my memories, and some viewers’ memories, of what ‘Schmo’ was,” he said. But he loved the bounty hunter concept and the character of Jake.The rest of the cast consists of improv actors with credits obscure enough to afford some cover. Rob Belushi (son of Jim) was recruited to play the Buddy, who befriends Mr. Rogan. Jo Newman had played a deaf character in her own act and so was a natural for Karlee.“In my audition I had to sing ‘I Will Survive’ in my deaf voice,” Ms. Newman said. She recognizes the character could be branded insensitive, but “Karlee is a strong woman,” she said. “She’s out to become a bounty hunter just like the others.”None of the cast members was told what they were really auditioning for — nor were their managers or agents.Once they signed on, the cast members felt pressure every moment, Ms. Newman said, because any slip could doom the series. She was especially under the gun because any inadvertent noise could give away that she wasn’t really deaf.The boldest casting decision was bringing in Mr. Lamas, who said he told the producers: “ ‘I’ve got 450 hours of television. He’s not going to know who I am?’ He didn’t know who I was at all.”Mr. Moore decided that since many reality shows include celebrities, Mr. Lamas, who once starred in “Renegade,” a show about bounty hunters, could be explained as someone looking to revive his career.Mr. Lamas had never before tried broad comedy, but he was game, even when asked to parade around in a bikini bottom.“When I’m wearing that Speedo, I’m thinking it’s all in for me,” he said. “If this doesn’t work, I will never work again, not even in movies that go straight to video.”His cast mates predicted that Mr. Lamas would get plenty of work — in comedy. The original “Schmo” elevated several careers, including Mr. Garman’s, but none more so than Kristen Wiig’s. She played the Quack.Of course there’s the moment of truth in the finale, when all is revealed to the schmo. Matt Kennedy Gould, the first schmo wound up all but breaking down — in surprise, disbelief or distress.In a 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Mr. Gould said: “If I had it to do over again, I wouldn’t do the show at all. Honestly, the show really made me feel dumb.” He said he spent his $100,000 on marijuana and alcohol, and eventually sought counseling.Ms. Levy said she would not comment on how Mr. Rogan took the news, except to say: “Matt and Chase are different people. Chase is more grounded.”The producers and cast members took pains to praise Mr. Rogan. “We considered him to be a very smart guy,” Mr. Stevens said. “He’s sharp. I was really freaked out about that all the time.”And Mr. Moore disavowed the notion that the show is an elaborate prank.“I don’t like the word ‘prank,’ ” he said. “Prank to me is negative and this to me is positive. We don’t make fun of this guy. We let him react to our craziness. It comes from the heart. It comes from a good place.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/us/sascha-guttfreund-of-scoremore-rubs-elbows-with-texas-hip-hop-stars.html,"In November, at the first Formula 1 United States Grand Prix in Austin, Bun B, a rap superstar from Houston, talked with Sascha Stone Guttfreund, a budding promoter for the state’s hip-hop scene, about the feasibility of a plan Mr. Guttfreund was considering: how to promote two shows by the rapper Kendrick Lamar on the same night in competing Houston locations.“It’s always a little surreal talking business with him,” said Mr. Guttfreund, a co-founder of the promotion and marketing company ScoreMore, which now regularly produces hip-hop concerts across Texas. “It doesn’t seem that long ago that I was just thrilled to hear Bun B call me by my first name.”These days, Mr. Guttfreund, 23, is accustomed to rubbing elbows with hip-hop’s glitterati. He is also accustomed to writing them six-figure checks to entice them to play Texas dates on their national tours.While giant promoters like LiveNation and C3 Presents generally book more hip-hop shows in bigger locations with better-known artists, ScoreMore has quickly established itself as a boutique promotion agency willing to bet its reputation, and a fair amount of money, on what it considers the next big thing.One of the company’s advertising slogans is “Your favorite rappers’ favorite promoters.” To prove this point, ScoreMore features a video on its Web site of testimonials by hip-hop’s top tier of young touring talent, like Mr. Lamar, Wiz Khalifa and Curren$y. ScoreMore produced sold-out Texas dates for each of those artists early in their careers, establishing a sense of loyalty among the scene’s major players.“We definitely talk amongst ourselves about guys that take care of their business,” said Bun B, who rose to national prominence in the 1990s as half of the pioneering Port Arthur-based duo UGK. “It’s easy to promote shows with big-name acts, guys with hits on the radio. But right away, ScoreMore took chances on a lot of great talent in its early stages. Those relationships that they built — not based on money, but on a belief in someone’s talents — paid off.”ScoreMore’s ability to draw sizable crowds for up-and- coming artists largely hinges on the company’s other slogan: “For students, by students.” In 2009, when he was at the University of Texas at Austin, Mr. Guttfreund started ScoreMore with $1,500 he had made in tips waiting tables. In the early days, he spoke at weekly sorority and fraternity meetings, talking up local musicians and hip-hop artists.Once the company had traction, he borrowed from the concept of street teams, a business model often used by hip-hop promoters, and hired fellow students to sell and deliver concert tickets to other students. Some student representatives receive college credits as interns, some are paid with free tickets to shows, and others earn cash commissions.“The commission model makes students feel ownership, like they’re a partner,” said Mr. Guttfreund, who runs ScoreMore out of an Austin apartment he shares with Claire Bogle, 22, the company’s other principal. “They like our grass-roots, bottom-up model of marketing. We’re not spending big money on radio and traditional advertising because we’ve got fans going straight to other fans.”Mr. Guttfreund credits the enthusiasm of ScoreMore’s student promoters for the sold-out club shows Mr. Lamar and Mr. Khalifa enjoyed early in their careers. (Both artists have recently received a bounty of positive mainstream press and significant radio play.) And on the back of those early successes, ScoreMore earned a reputation as both a hip-hop trend spotter and a force in the music scene.“Traditionally, a promoter is somebody behind the scenes that you don’t know or recognize,” said Bun B, who was the headliner of a ScoreMore South by Southwest Music Festival party that also featured Big Sean, Chiddy Bang and Mr. Lamar. “There’s people who come to a ScoreMore show not because of a hit record or industry buzz, but because they have learned to trust and believe in their taste.”ScoreMore is beginning to capitalize on this cachet and is expanding its reach beyond music. It introduced Vintage for the Vain (VFTV), a clothing line, in December.According to Mr. Guttfreund, the more important extension of ScoreMore in 2013 will be geographical. He is exploring ways to take his student-led marketing model to cities and universities beyond the South, and to establish partnerships with larger brands that want to take their messages and products directly to college campuses.“We want to build this into a national touring model where we help artists get a college demographic to their shows,” Mr. Guttfreund said. “And we can do that for brands too. We’ve tested the model, and we know it works.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/arts/music/benny-blanco-hit-maker-for-rihanna-and-maroon-5.html,"ONE of the first things you notice about Benny Blanco, besides the impish brown eyes and the curly hair piled up in a Prince-like coif, are the many curios adorning his hands and wrists.He started collecting them a few years ago to mark the hits he has helped write and produce. The old Rolex on his right wrist he bought when Maroon 5’s “Moves Like Jagger” topped Billboard’s Hot 100 chart in 2011. The fat silver ring on his left hand was added last summer when “Payphone,” by the same band, reached No. 2. And a Buddha ring on his left thumb marks the rise of Trey Songz’s “Heart Attack” to No. 3 on the R&B chart last June.At 24 Mr. Blanco is already running out of fingers. Since 2008, when the pop hit maker Dr. Luke first recruited him into his stable of songwriters, he has had a hand in six No. 1 hits on Billboard’s Hot 100 as a writer and producer, working with artists like Rihanna, Kesha, Katy Perry and Maroon 5. He’s been a writer for another seven songs that have cracked the Top 10. It is hard to listen to pop radio for 10 minutes without hearing a song on which Mr. Blanco has played a pivotal role. Last month two songs he helped compose and produce — Rihanna’s “Diamonds” and Kesha’s “Die Young” — were lodged in the top two spots on Hot 100 chart. Over the past three years he has been behind ubiquitous radio hits like Gym Class Heroes’ “Stereo Hearts,” Taio Cruz’s “Dynamite” and Kesha’s “Tik Tok.”Lounging among giant pillows on the bed he keeps in his home studio in Chelsea — he says he likes putting a bed in every studio he uses — Mr. Blanco acknowledged that luck has played a role in his winning streak. “I am still waiting for the day that they say ‘Time’s up, Blanco,’ ” he said, grinning lazily. “Back to your shift at Walmart.”Songwriting for pop radio is a team sport these days, and Mr. Blanco is by all accounts like a utility infielder in baseball, someone good at all positions who makes everyone better at their jobs. He is talented at making electronic beats and drum tracks from bizarre samples. But he also has a gift for sunny hooks and catchy chord progressions, and if the need arises, he can turn out competent lyrics, often with a crisp and profane edge.“I just try to fit in where it makes sense,” he said. “I’m not particularly good at anything. I’m not an incredible guitarist or piano player or songwriter. I think what I do is, when I notice someone is really good at something, I try to get that out of them.”Mikkel S. Eriksen, part of the songwriting team Stargate, said that Mr. Blanco, as a producer, always reaches for unexpected sounds. On “Diamonds,” the Rihanna hit he wrote with Stargate, he took a snippet of Mr. Eriksen’s singing, altered the sound electronically to make it dirtier, then used that timbre, manipulated with audio software, to create ghostly accompaniment lines. “His technique is somewhat unorthodox,” Mr. Eriksen said, “as he almost never plays the keyboards but throws in weird samples and alters them to the right pitch to go with the song.”Mr. Blanco is a scavenger of peculiar sounds, including those made by his body; his French bulldog, Disco; the lock on his door; and the clatter of bowls on a table — all of which he has incorporated into Top 10 pop songs.He shuns building music from scratch with computer-generated timbres. He instead seeks out traditional instruments and low-end keyboards, records them and then builds melodies and chords from the tones they yield. His studio is littered with peculiar instruments: rare guitars, ukuleles, a pump organ from Egypt, a Roland analog synthesizer from the 1970s, stacks of cheap Yamaha and Casio keyboards and assorted percussion instruments, toy pianos and accordions.One of his favorites is a small Yamaha keyboard that he used to record parts of “Tik Tok” and Ms. Perry’s “California Gurls.” He bought it for $25 at a yard sale. The keys are yellowed and uneven, and he had to install a jack so it could be connected to a soundboard.“I just want to sound different than everyone else,” he said. “I don’t care if it sounds bad. I just want people to be like, ‘Yo, that dude Benny was different.’ Even if it sounds awful, at least they can’t say, ‘Oh well, I’ve heard that before.’ ”Yet his collaborators say Mr. Blanco’s biggest asset lies not in his hard-to-duplicate catalog of sounds but in his ears and instincts. Much of what Mr. Blanco does during songwriting sessions, they say, is direct the creative flow of other musicians, pulling them in directions they would normally avoid.“I think Benny’s greatest strength is his taste and his ability to know when something is amazing,” said Ammar Malik, who wrote “Stereo Hearts” and “Payphone” with Mr. Blanco. “When I’m in the room with him, he inspires me to find a different sound, one that I didn’t know how to do on my own.”Adam Levine, the lead singer and songwriter for Maroon 5, said: “It’s almost as if he has the Midas touch in putting the right people together at the right time to create a musical moment. He’s about the collaboration. And he’s so good at nailing down who does everything best.”When the production of “Payphone” stalled, Mr. Levine said, it was Mr. Blanco who called up the rapper Wiz Khalifa, with whom he had worked on other projects, and invited him to do a solo. Though Wiz Khalifa had never touched a ready-for-pop-radio song, he freestyled a rap over a beat that Mr. Blanco invented on the spot, and it became central to the song’s appeal.Mr. Blanco starts songwriting sessions by playing a mixtape of tunes he finds inspiring, tracks he has harvested from the Internet to evoke the sound he wants. He then pushes the artists to jam along those lines until he hears the kernel of a song. He likens the process to group therapy.“When you are writing in the studio, it’s like the people who are in the studio with you are a dysfunctional family,” he said. “You are basically like a therapist. It’s psychology.”His colleagues say one of his studio tools is a wicked, self-deprecating sense of humor, which he uses to break tension. “He’s so funny, it’s crazy,” the rapper Spank Rock said. Asked about his passions outside music, Mr. Blanco said, deadpan, “Lots of peyote and masturbation.”Mr. Blanco, whose real surname is Levin, never expected to become a pop tunesmith. Growing up in Reston, Va., he fell in love with hip-hop, he said, when he bought a Nas cassette at the age of 5. He started rapping and making beats when he was a teenager, performing at his older brother’s college parties at the University of Delaware. Before he graduated from South Lakes High School, he was making weekend trips to Philadelphia, Atlantic City and New York, where he befriended producers who let him use their studios.Among them was David Shayman, or Disco D, an eccentric and troubled beat maker who became his mentor. After graduation Mr. Blanco moved to Brooklyn and worked as Disco D’s intern, an experience he likened to being a monk in a kung fu monastery. (At one point Mr. Shayman threw Mr. Blanco’s CD collection out a window.) Through Mr. Shayman, who committed suicide in 2007, Mr. Blanco met the Baltimore rapper Spank Rock, and in 2008 the two of them put together “Bangers & Cash,” a raucous EP that quickly landed them a contract with Downtown Records.That collection of five risqué raps also attracted the attention of Dr. Luke, the former guitarist for the “Saturday Night Live” band who has become a hugely successful pop songwriter. In 2008 Dr. Luke recruited Mr. Blanco to help create songs for Britney Spears and two new artists: Ms. Perry and Kesha. Mr. Blanco said he had little interest in writing Top 40 songs at the time. His tastes ran toward left-field electronic music, like the tracks Justice and Diplo were making, and his main influences were Prince and Motown vocalists like David Ruffin and Eddie Kendricks of the Temptations.But working with Dr. Luke taught him about song structure and dynamics, about creating rising drama and moments of respite from that drama in the verse, bridge and chorus. “Pop songs are like a D.J. set crammed into three minutes,” he said. Asked to define the secret to a pop hit, he said it was simple: The message must resonate with listeners. “You’ve got to feel like that could have been me,” he said.Over the last two years, as his reputation has grown, he has started moving out of Dr. Luke’s orbit, collaborating more with the Swedish songwriters Shellback and Max Martin and, more recently, with the Stargate duo and with Bruno Mars. He has also begun to dip back into hip-hop and urban music, composing songs with Wiz Khalifa like “Work Hard, Play Hard” and “No Sleep.”Though his dance card this spring includes projects for Maroon 5 and Rihanna, he said he is looking to break out of pop and further establish himself in hip-hop. He relishes the role of newcomer. “I want to be that new guy that no one wants to work with,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/arts/television/downton-abbey-reaches-around-the-world.html,"NOT long ago the actor Jim Carter replaced the crisp butler’s uniform he wears on “Downton Abbey” with a snug Lycra ensemble for a getting-away-from-it-all cycling trip in Cambodia. Shooting had ended on the third season, which begins Sunday on PBS, and he celebrated with a long ride along the Mekong River. Amid the ancient temples of Angkor Wat he found himself wilting in the steamy climate — and suddenly swarmed by a group of Asian tourists screaming, “Mr. Carson!”“Downton Abbey,” an absorbing if somewhat formulaic costume drama set in the early decades of the 20th century, surprised even its architects by becoming a transcendent hit in both Britain and America, becoming possibly the most successful show in the 40-year history of PBS’s “Masterpiece” series. “Nobody in their right mind could have predicted what happened, when it sort of went viral,” Julian Fellowes, the creator and the writer of the show, said in recent phone interview.But perhaps even more surprising, the series, a quintessentially British dramedy of manners, has also become a hit in Sweden, Russia, South Korea, the Middle East and dozens of other locales where viewers wouldn’t know a dowager from a dogsbody.Since its September 2010 premiere on ITV in Britain, the show, co-produced by Carnival Films (now part of NBC Universal) and “Masterpiece,” has appeared in more than 200 countries or regions, suggesting that anxiety about status and familial obligations — and a weakness for mushy melodrama — observe no geographic bounds.“Although in one sense,” Mr. Fellowes said, “ ‘Downton’ is very British — it’s very fixed in a particular part and way of life, a particular limited range of society and so on — I think most of the stories are about emotional situations that everyone can understand.”Despite the occasional snag — Greece’s state television network recently excised a scene depicting a romantic kiss between two male characters, prompting a minor outcry — “Downton Abbey” was the most-watched drama in Denmark, the No. 1 scripted series in the Netherlands and at or near the top of its time slot in countries like Singapore and Brazil last year, according to figures provided by NBC Universal International. It has also been one of the most watched imports in Australia, Norway, Belgium, Israel and Iceland, according to Amandine Cassi, head of international television research at Eurodata TV Worldwide, an audience-research company based in Paris. The show’s success is on a scale almost never reached by British or European series, she added.“We took the risk of airing a period series in a slot dedicated to contemporary fiction because we believe in its strength, and the way its themes are dealt with is timeless,” Claudia Macedo, head of acquisitions for Globosat, the network that carries the series in Brazil, wrote in an e-mail.NBC Universal estimates that more than 120 million viewers worldwide have watched “Downton Abbey” at some point, based on ratings data from its international client broadcasters. That number should grow significantly when CCTV in China begins offering a version dubbed in Mandarin this year, although at least some of the country’s viewers are already well versed in the world of “Downton.”“I was in Shanghai earlier this year and people were coming up to me saying it was their favorite show,” Gareth Neame, managing director of Carnival Films, who came up with the initial idea for the series, said in a phone interview. “This is the People’s Republic of China, and this is a show all about primogeniture and inheritance and aristocracy and all those things that you thought the whole point of China was to do away with. So that was a surprise.”The producers say the show resonates so deeply because of the universality of themes like the tensions of social status and, most important, the unabashed romance. “Downton” marries conventional British costume drama with “quite soapy plotting, with characters that provide many, many different points of entry,” Mr. Neame, an executive producer, said. “The romance is depicted in a very sort of genuine, heartfelt way,” he added. “And we’ve found that no matter where you live on this planet, you get it.”Mr. Fellowes added, “You travel thousands and thousands of miles, and you get off the plane, and someone says, ‘Is Mr. Carson going to marry Mrs. Hughes?’ ”Sales representatives make the most lucrative deals they can with local networks and then deliver a broadcast-ready version of the show, which can include hiring actors to dub the dialogue into the region’s dominant language, if necessary. While hearing Maggie Smith’s Violet deliver her zingers in, say, Italian might be comical for viewers used to the classic version, the producers have been largely happy with the result.“The dialogue is altered, inevitably, and maybe some of the gags don’t quite work in another language,” conceded Mr. Fellowes, who writes every episode, but “I’m terribly pleased if people are enjoying it.”More problematic, from a creative standpoint, is the rearrangement of individual episodes. Just as PBS viewers see a slightly different version of “Downton” from those in Britain, after the producers make minor tweaks to accommodate the “Masterpiece” time slot, global audiences often see episodes that have been chopped up and reassembled for broadcasters who, for example, want to split the season into six episodes instead of the nine that run in Britain.The practice is “a bit messy,” Mr. Neame acknowledged. “You have to realize it’s commerce, and just accept it.”For his part Mr. Fellowes has accepted that whatever “Downton Abbey” comes to mean for foreign audiences is ultimately beyond his influence.“With ‘Downton’ having this great effect in America or the Far East or wherever, somehow it’s doing that for itself,” he said. “What I wanted for the show and what I thought I was putting into it and what I wanted to come out — I think that’s finished when you complete it. Then it has to run under its own steam.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/arts/television/shirley-maclaine-on-downton-abbey.html,"AS if the impending nuptials of Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley, not to mention all the social and economic upheaval of the early 1920s, were not enough to set servants scurrying and sherry glasses crashing in the decorous halls of “Downton Abbey,” that period drama is getting one more shock to its system when its third season begins Sunday on PBS’s “Masterpiece.” This year Shirley MacLaine joins its cast as Martha Levinson, the mother of Cora, Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), who arrives from America bringing a tart tongue and liberal attitudes unfamiliar to her daughter’s aristocratic household.As surely as Martha’s unusual sense of propriety affronts some longtime Downton residents — particularly the prim Dowager Countess, Violet (Maggie Smith) — Ms. MacLaine, an Oscar winner for “Terms of Endearment” and a star of films like “The Apartment,” “Steel Magnolias” and “Bernie,” has lived her life with a similar spirit of irreverence and nonchalance. As this exuberant 78-year-old actress demonstrated in a recent telephone conversation from her home in Los Angeles, there is nothing that she places off-limits, from her views on sexuality to her ideas about mysticism and reincarnation — at least, once she got her iPhone working. Here are excerpts from the interview:Q. Hi, Ms. MacLaine?A. Oh, hi, one second. I’m just trying to learn my new iPhone. [Laughs] I’m trying my best to be technological, in a rather colorful, poetic world I am used to living in.Q. They’re very user-friendly.A. No, they’re not. But I am.Q. This feels like a perfect segue to talk about life in the early 20th century.A. Oh my God, wasn’t that something? Going into that world, with those people who really seem to be living it. I didn’t know “Downton Abbey.” I learned about it at my hairdresser. Really. I look at PBS for news.Q. Do you make all your career choices based on what your hairdresser says?A. I don’t ask him for advice. But all the girls were talking about it. They were trying to figure out who was Elizabeth McGovern’s mother, and whether she was a Rothschild, whether she was Jewish. The next thing I knew I got a call from my agent about playing Elizabeth McGovern’s mother. I’d better look at this. And whoa — I got addicted for a full week.Q. What about the show hooked you in?A. I realized that Julian [Fellowes, the “Downton Abbey” creator and producer] had either purposely or inadvertently stumbled on a formula for quality television in the Internet age. Which means there are, what, 15 or so lives and subplots, with which not too much time is spent so you don’t get bored, but enough time is spent so you are vitally interested.Q. Is that why you agreed to meet with Julian Fellowes?A. I think I wanted to meet Bates [played by Brendan Coyle], basically. And of course Julian, being so wily, arranged a lunch at which nobody else was there but Bates. I guess he was seeing if he was cougar-able. Or something.Q. When you’re going up against Maggie Smith — there’s one scene where you serenade her a bit — how do you prepare?A. I thought the best course of action in going toe to toe with Maggie would be a sense of American expressive feeling. What does she do with that? I told her I was going to sing it, and first she said to me, [genteel Maggie Smith voice] “You know, dear, when you do that, I’m going to fall off the chair.” I said, O.K. And then she said, “No, I think not. I think I’ll fall asleep.” I said, O.K., that’s good too. And then she said, “No, I think I will cry.” I said, I don’t know what you’d do that for, but whatever. What she did instead was flirt back. [Laughs] I was so surprised.The day we shot in the church, when we’re all done up in our white fur, we sat there all day. And Maggie and I don’t like to get up and walk around a lot anymore. So we sat and we reminisced about life and lovers and the business and directors. That was really interesting and so much fun.Q. When you’re comparing lists of lovers, did you find any names in common?A. Oh! No. She never really used names. When we were doing a press conference here, someone asked me if I had known Maggie before. And I said, “Oh, yes, we were lovers in another life.” [Laughs] I don’t know where that came from.Q. Do you genuinely believe that?A. How the hell do you know? Listen, since I don’t know where it came from, maybe it’s true. I have no idea.Q. You seem to have better antennas for these transcendental experiences.A.  Yeah, comedic metaphysics. That’s the way I think of it right now.Q. But in the course of working on a show like this, where you get to inhabit another time period, the setting, the costumes ——A. No, I didn’t have any familiarity at all. I didn’t feel that at all. I was more interested in the buttons and whether they were popping open, and rain in my face. That, I have come to call reality. But how do I know I’m right? When you look at it, my goodness, I can’t prove that we’re all alive right now. It could be an illusion as far as I’m concerned. That’s the stuff that interests me: What is reality?Q. Do you feel like you’re more comfortable with yourself than others are with themselves?A. Well, I’m not your run-of-the-mill lady from the Valley, am I? Come on, I’ve got lots of reasons to be viewed eccentrically.Q. You’re O.K. being described that way?A. As long as they don’t do it with a hidden meaning. Right now I would call General Petraeus the most eccentric man I know. Who the hell would admit that and then resign? Q. You think he should have confessed his affair but not resigned his position?A. I think he should have done neither. And gone ahead and done what everybody else was doing and enjoying his life.Q. People aren’t comfortable with sexual lives that deviate from the norm.A. I don’t know what the norm is. The latest evaluations on human sexuality say that we are one-third monogamous, one-third serially monogamous and one-third polygamous. I would say there should be some kind of form to fill out before you promise monogamy.Q. Do I dare ask which category you put yourself in?A. Serially monogamous, that’s what I was.Q. Meaning, while you’re with someone, you’re faithful to that person?A. Yeah, till it wears off. [Laughs]Q. Where do you find the time to act and still write a new book every few years?A. I’ve learned as I’ve gotten older to not strive anymore. That doesn’t mean giving up. It means surrendering to a more wise truth. I don’t plan anything. I just sit down, and it all just happens. I don’t know if it’s any good but that’s the way I act too.I’m going into this picture [“Elsa & Fred”] with Christopher Plummer. I have no idea what I’m going to do, I really don’t. Christopher and I have worked together before, so we’re friends. But I don’t like leading out the actors and the director by being so prepared that I’d be thrown by their reality. Because I don’t know anything about acting. Never have.Q. You must come with some ideas.A. Yeah, it’s called the script.Q. When you get offered all these roles where you’re playing family matriarchs or grandmothers ——A. How about the great-grandmother?Q. Does it change the way you think about yourself?A. Of course. The one thing I truly have a hard time believing is that I’m 78. I shan’t say that I like everybody helping me down the stairs and out of my trailer. But it’s nice to have 50 percent of them do it.Q. Would you do live theater again?A. I do miss the stage. There’s nothing like it, nothing. When I did my one-woman show and played the Palace and played the Gershwin and all that, I did — what? — eight shows or maybe more a week. Of course you can’t do anything else, and you can’t run quickly for a cab in the rain, and you can’t have a drunken love affair. You can’t do any of that. Because you’ve got to be perfectly healthy. And I guess I value enjoying my life a little bit more than the discipline these days."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/arts/sergiu-nicolaescu-romanian-film-director-dies-at-82.html,"BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) — Sergiu Nicolaescu, a popular Romanian director who also served for 20 years as a senator, died here on Thursday. He was 82.The cause was heart and lung complications after surgery for digestive problems, the Elias Hospital said.Mr. Nicolaescu directed about 50 movies, and despite his parallel career in politics — he was a Social Democratic Party senator from 1992 until he stepped down last month — he continued to make films until recently. He was best known for historical epics like “Mihai the Brave” (1979) that found favor with Romania’s Communist government, which collapsed in 1989. Mr. Nicolaescu was also an actor and played several leading roles, notably King Carol I in “Carol I” (2010), which he also directed.Survivors include his wife, Dana."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/arts/television/buckwild-washington-heights-and-black-ink-crew-on-tv.html,"“Jersey Shore” ended in December, retiring after six seasons as one of television’s signature reality shows. And while it was a demolition derby of inebriation, spray-tanning and hard house music, it was also, at least in part, ethnography. Never before had the rituals, quirks and peccadilloes of young Italians, or Italianates, been given such a bullhorn.“Jersey Shore” was doing what reality TV had previously done only sporadically: shine a light on a genuine, region-specific American subculture. What years of strong ratings revealed, however, was that subculture was exportable. What might have started out as idle curiosity or even schadenfreude eventually turned into reliable affection and fandom.It was a new phenomenon. Cable channels — particularly MTV, but others as well — have been looking for ways to replicate it and turn it into reliable formula. They’ve done that by a scavenger hunt, of sorts, for young people from groups rarely seen on television, hoping that one of them will squeeze out something universal from the specific.Last week MTV unveiled “Buckwild,” about a group of rowdy but relatable young people in rural West Virginia, and on Wednesday it will introduce “Washington Heights,” a docu-novela set among Dominican-Americans in the titular Manhattan neighborhood. On Monday VH1 welcomes “Black Ink Crew,” which is set in a Harlem tattoo parlor.Of the three the carefree “Buckwild” has the most “Jersey Shore” in its bones. Like that show’s first season this one places a group of young people with ample free time in a house — they knew one another, in this case — and gives them a long leash to misbehave. That means drinking, parties that enrage the neighbors, and romance, most of which revolves around Cara, who has been imported from the city (Morgantown, that is) to titillate the boys and incense the other girls.This all takes place in Sissonville, W.Va., which has one stop light and a lot of homespun ingenuity. By the measuring stick of most TV programming it qualifies as foreign; the cast member with the thickest accent, Shain, is frequently subtitled. And the behavior is novel too. “Buckwild” is really a bumpkin “Jackass,” right down to the don’t-try-this-at-home disclaimer at the top of the show.In the premiere the cast members turn a dump truck into a swimming pool, go mudding in a pickup truck and get stuck, and set a car on fire near a clutch of trees but avoid a forest fire. And Shain takes a nerve-racking spin in a backhoe, which he calls a Sissonville roller coaster. Whoever discovered these kids deserves a Fulbright.The show has arrived with the usual fuss, denounced as a scourge by government officials and neighbors. (MTV did not make screeners of the premiere available to critics.) Everyone wants his or her community portrayed as spotless, which means difficult portrayals should be applauded, even as they’re criticized. That’s what happens when uncomfortable schisms are revealed, when family business becomes public.All of the glamour that’s missing from “Buckwild” shows up in “Washington Heights,” which plays out like a Dominican-American “Laguna Beach” or “The Hills,” though at least some of the cast members of this show have evident career aspirations.It’s shot with the same cool reverence as those earlier shows — unlike “Buckwild,” which has some of the skittish camerawork of “Jersey Shore,” the scenes here are slick. Everyone looks beautiful and is framed elegantly.And almost everyone has a goal — J P wants to rap, Jimmy dreams of playing professional baseball, Frankie does spoken poetry, and Ludwin wants to be an artist. (Sadly, no one wants to be a bachatero.) The affection within the group is genuine and affecting.But like “Jersey Shore” this show has brawling. At the end of the first episode the tensions between Jimmy’s close friend Reyna and his girlfriend, Eliza, come to a head outside J P’s concert, leading to an intervention by, of all people, J P’s mother, who moments earlier had been enjoying herself inside the club. As on “Jersey Shore” it’s family first.On the surface “Black Ink Crew” merely relocates familiar tattooing shows like “LA Ink” and “Miami Ink” to Harlem, with a black cast. But there’s a rhythm and comfort to this show that those lack. This crew has its own slang and back stories that are dark in ways that serve to bring its members together and also to tear them apart.Black reality shows are often saddled with the burden of representation; see the backlash against “Love & Hip Hop” and “The Real Housewives of Atlanta.” But judging by the coming-attractions clips at the end of the premiere the critique of this show will be internal, when one cast member, Dutchess, complains that her colleagues aren’t representing the business — and by extension, the race — well.Even if these new shows end up being remakes of familiar paradigms, more is at stake here. English-language television has never featured Dominican culture as intensely as “Washington Heights” does, and the hollers of West Virginia were a mystery until “Buckwild.” The portrayals on these shows might be messy, but they’re also helpful to understanding the country as less monolithic. (There are other such shows on the horizon. This month A&E will start “Southie Rules,” about a wacky, heavily accented, working-class Boston family.)“Jersey Shore” lasted as long as it did because its characters began to transcend archetype. They put themselves on display and demonstrated that they weren’t outsiders or anomalies after all. And they live on, whether in the spinoff “Snooki & Jwoww” or on the forthcoming talk show hosted by Vinny Guadagnino.The reverse colonization continues."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/media/cutting-edge-group-buys-varese-sarabande.html,"LOS ANGELES — Some significant players in the usually quiet movie soundtrack business are about to turn up the volume.Over the holidays, the Cutting Edge Group, a company in London that provides and invests in music for the screen, and its partner Wood Creek Capital Management acquired a well-known purveyor of soundtracks: the Varèse Sarabande record label.The acquisition was disclosed in interviews last week with executives involved in the transaction. They declined to discuss the terms of the deal, but described it as an initial step in using about $100 million in funds that will extend the reach of Cutting Edge, beginning with the purchase and expansion of Varése Sarabande, which will quickly increase its output by half to at least 60 soundtracks a year.The financing will come from Wood Creek, which is based in Connecticut, and from two additional backers, Octopus Investments and Aberdeen Asset Management, which are based in Britain and are otherwise involved with Cutting Edge.“When you deploy $100 million in this space, that’s an awful lot of money,” said Philip Moross, the chief executive of Cutting Edge.Mr. Moross, who spoke by telephone on Thursday, referred to a movie music business in which the budgets for film scores have dwindled, as inexpensive or stolen downloads knocked the bottom out of soundtrack sales.The music for “The Bodyguard” from 1992, which starred Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner, sold about 12 million albums in the United States, for instance; but more recent hits, like the “Twilight” soundtrack, have sold a fraction of that number.Cutting Edge has grown by spreading its portfolio to include the management of music rights, the representation of composers, and upfront investment in the music for many films. By spending a relatively modest sum for rights to the music of films like “The King’s Speech” while they are still in production, for example, Cutting Edge helps to underwrite a stronger soundtrack. It can then recoup its money through aggressive sales of the music to advertisers and others.Varése Sarabande, which released its first album in 1978, was founded in Los Angeles by the entrepreneur Chris Kuchler and others, and did well by specializing in what larger competitors had left behind. (The label’s unusual name, born of a merger between the predecessor Varése International with Sarabande Records, combines the name of the composer Edgard Varése with the term for a Spanish dance.)Its recent soundtracks include music from “The Bourne Legacy,” “The Help,” and the second season of HBO’s “Game of Thrones” The company has focused largely on scores, rather than on song compilations that require the acquisition of expensive rights.Varése Sarabande releases about 40 soundtracks a year. But that number will quickly grow to 60 or more, said Darren Blumenthal, a Los Angeles investment adviser who introduced Mr. Moross to Mr. Kuchler, and will now become chief executive of Varése Sarabande.Mr. Kuchler, who was the principal owner of Varése Sarabande, will stay with the label at least through a transition period of several months, and Robert Townson, its managing director, is expected to remain in place. “Being together is better for both of us,” Mr. Kuchler said in an e-mail on Saturday. “They needed us to round out our operation, and we needed them because things have been getting difficult in our niche area of the music industry.”Mr. Blumenthal, who spoke jointly with Mr. Moross on Thursday, said the decision to sell came slowly for Mr. Kuchler, who turned down a parade of potential buyers over the last five years.Mr. Moross, said Mr. Blumenthal, began negotiating with Mr. Kuchler about two years ago. And the deal finally closed in late December, as entrepreneurs across the United States were busy selling assets in advance of an anticipated increase in federal taxes.Mr. Kuchler turned away most potential buyers, Mr. Blumenthal said, because they were “financial, versus strategic.”The strategic advantage in joining with Cutting Edge, he said, includes an expectation that all or most of the five dozen films with which Cutting Edge is involved annually will now release a score via Varése Sarabande.Thus, “Side Effects,” which was directed by Steven Soderbergh and is set for release on Feb. 8 by Open Road Films, was made with input from Cutting Edge, which invested in the music, helped find the music supervisor, and will now release its score, by Thomas Newman, on Varése Sarabande.Mr. Moross and Mr. Blumenthal also talk of expanding Varése Sarabande’s existing events business, which has regularly staged concerts at festivals and elsewhere in recent years.That could mean having film scores conducted by their composers at the Hollywood Bowl, for instance, then selling recordings of the performance, Mr. Moross said.It is just one way, he added, of getting more value from scores. “These are highly undervalued properties,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/arts/music/new-jersey-symphony-orchestra-at-prudential-hall.html,"NEWARK — Jacques Lacombe, the adventurous music director of the ambitious New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, took the stage of Prudential Hall at the New Jersey Performing Arts Center here on Friday night with a mission and a microphone. Both proved assets in a bold undertaking: a performance of the British composer Michael Tippett’s Symphony No. 4, a work probably unfamiliar to most of those assembled, onstage and off.The event was the start of the orchestra’s third Winter Festival, an annual series in which concerts linked by elemental themes are surrounded with lectures and exhibitions. After festivals inspired by water and fire, this year’s theme is “Air and the Atmosphere.”Fitting Tippett’s symphony into that scheme was a stretch, based solely on its inclusion of the sound of human breathing, digitally sampled and amplified. In writing the work for the Chicago Symphony Orchestra in 1977 Tippett conceived it as a “birth to death” span of seven sections presented in an almost seamless sequence, a notion reminiscent of certain works by Richard Strauss.Although the symphony contains no false note or unlovely gesture, perceiving its idiosyncratic structure and personal logic can initially be daunting. Addressing the audience before the performance Mr. Lacombe succinctly explained its workings.No less important, he said that the presentation was the culmination of an aspiration that started when he first heard the piece a decade ago, in the company of a close friend who had been given a diagnosis of cancer. Both were moved to tears by the work’s stark evocation of mortality. (The friend, he added, had recovered and recently celebrated a birthday.)That personal touch must have helped to set any apprehensive audience members at ease. No one left the hall prematurely during an account abetted by lush strings; lucid woodwind solos, burnished brass and horn chorales; scampering percussion; and passages of crystalline transparency.Though not spotless, the performance was more persuasive than tentative. Generous applause followed. Eavesdropping on conversations among fascinated children and their parents during intermission was an added treat.The program’s second half featured a vibrantly characterized rendition of Holst’s “Planets,” like Tippett’s symphony a British work in which the span of human life is evoked, though here through astrological archetypes. The start of “Mars, the Bringer of War” felt slightly erratic. But from there Mr. Lacombe navigated a sure course, charting a luminous “Venus,” a sprightly “Mercury,” a hearty “Jupiter” and a “Saturn” in which the remorseless tread of time was powerfully conveyed.After a suitably macabre “Uranus,” Mr. Lacombe incorporated an offbeat effect in “Neptune,” using the American Boychoir in offstage passages originally intended for women’s voices. Though pitch was not as airtight as it might have been were adult performers employed, the plaintive trebles heightened the otherworldly eeriness of a beguiling interpretation."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/arts/television/tony-lip-actor-in-the-sopranos-dies-at-82.html,"PARAMUS, N.J. (AP) — Tony Lip, an actor known for playing mobsters on “The Sopranos” and in many feature films, died on Friday in Teaneck, N.J. He was 82.Family members told The Record of Woodland Park that Mr. Lip, whose real name was Frank Anthony Vallelonga and who lived in Paramus, died at a hospital in Teaneck after several years of failing health.Mr. Lip was best known for playing the mob kingpin Carmine Lupertazzi in several episodes of “The Sopranos,” the HBO series about the personal and professional life of a troubled mob boss played by James Gandolfini. He made his movie debut in an uncredited role as a wedding guest in “The Godfather” and also appeared in “Goodfellas,” “Raging Bull,” “Donnie Brasco” and other films.In the 1960s, before becoming an actor, he worked at the Copacabana nightclub in Manhattan, where among the celebrities he met were the kind of gangsters he would later portray."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/arts/television/jamie-kennedys-first-night-on-new-years-eve.html,"As New Year’s Eve telecasts go, this one was not exactly a tightly planned, rigidly precise Ryan Seacrest-style affair.Last Monday night, Jamie Kennedy, the comedian and star of films like “Scream” and “Malibu’s Most Wanted,” hosted “First Night,” a live special broadcast by KDOC, an independent Southern California television station. Advertisements for the show promised celebrity cameos, musical guests and other surprises, and viewers who tuned in surely had their share of unexpected laughs.Presiding over the shaky-looking and decidedly seat-of-the-pants event Mr. Kennedy mixed it up with exuberant revelers outside the Chinese Theater in Hollywood, occasionally being caught off guard by his own live cameras and open microphones. Innuendos were made; obscene words were broadcast unbleeped; and Macy Gray gave a performance that had some viewers wondering if she’d started celebrating the arrival of 2013 well before midnight.The show concluded with Mr. Kennedy leaping from a crowded stage where bodies jostled uncomfortably, as he declared, “There’s a fight! It’s ending with a fight!”Taking stock of his haphazard show in a subsequent phone interview, Mr. Kennedy said: “It was totally supposed to be like that. We wanted to make almost an anti-New Year’s Eve show, and the recipe calls for unexpected.”But since an edited video  made its way onto the Internet, transforming it from a little-seen local broadcast to a viral phenomenon, viewers can’t seem to agree which parts were intentional or accidental.The online gossip columnist Perez Hilton declared in a post citing an unnamed insider “that this gloriousness was all a hoax.” The A.V. Club decreed the show to be “the world’s worst New Year’s broadcast” and “a train wreck of ridiculous proportions.”Shaun Broyls, an actor and comedian in Burbank, Calif., who watched the live “First Night” broadcast and then posted parts of it on YouTube, said the show was “100 percent a fail.”“There was no way that this broadcast was meant to turn out the way it turned out,” said Mr. Broyls, who has also worked as a television news reporter. “The numerous swears, the terrible edits, the audio glitches, the video glitches.”Mr. Kennedy has previously walked the line between awkward comedy and audience provocation in a hidden-camera television series, “The Jamie Kennedy Experiment,” and a documentary, “Heckler.” Nonetheless he was surprised that some viewers were put off by the spirit of spontaneity he strove for in the New Year’s Eve special.“Back in the day Jerry Lewis used to do it with his telethons for 24 hours straight, and things would happen, and that’s what made it interesting,” Mr. Kennedy said. “We wanted people to go, ‘What’s going to happen next?’ ”Mr. Kennedy said he was used to polarized reactions to his work. “Sometimes I’m like the Kardashian of comedy,” he said. “People seem to hate me, but they can’t stop watching. I’m fine.”But when asked about some of the vituperative online responses to his show, his voice began to rise.“With the Internet you can’t fail anymore,” he said. “Everything has to be perfect. How come you can’t fail anymore, or try something? O.K., so maybe it didn’t work. But I tried, and you’re talking about it.”Representatives of KDOC did not respond to requests for comment. But in an e-mail sent after his interview Mr. Kennedy offered an apology “for any obscenities that may have slipped out due to technical difficulties from filming live.” The e-mail added: “That was never planned or intended to be a part of the show. We just wanted it to be different and a parody of all the other N.Y.E. shows.”Adam Pearce, a professional wrestler who attended Mr. Kennedy’s show, said he “didn’t notice anything chaotic or out of the ordinary from a broadcast perspective” during it, despite his getting caught up in the unruly crowd onstage at the end of the night.Though he has not seen the broadcast in its entirety, Mr. Pearce said he was not surprised by the online reaction. Asked if some elements might have been orchestrated to maximize disorder, he said he could not rule out the possibility.“If you’re trying to get people to pay attention to you, you want to put things in place that will do that,” Mr. Pearce said. “You open up an open bar for everybody, you’ve got the bubbly going, and who knows what else was being passed around. You throw all these things in a caldron and stir it up and see what happens.”Despite his criticism of the show, Mr. Broyls said he was glad to have helped it reach a wider audience (and for the YouTube views and Twitter followers it had brought him). He said that YouTube had made him take down the version he originally posted because of a copyright claim from KDOC. But others made copies of his video, so it lives on.After some discussion he acknowledged that it had a “rough charm,” like the cheesy movies shown on “Mystery Science Theater 3000” or “The Star Wars Holiday Special,” which became a cult classic after being broadcast only once in 1978.“This is honestly something that everyone should see,” Mr. Broyls said.Mr. Kennedy may have the last laugh. “I got a text from Marilyn Manson that says he wants to do next year,” he said.He might be back on the airwaves even sooner than that.“If you can believe it, I want do an Oscars special,” he said. “We have to wait and see how this blows over.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/sports/ncaafootball/bcs-a-j-mccarron-and-everett-golson-have-faced-down-doubts.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — For a weeklong trip, Alabama quarterback A J McCarron packed 30 pairs of shoes, too many bow ties to remember, and enough hair gel to share. Some men may have been embarrassed to admit so.McCarron was not always so sure of himself. In middle school, he was so shy that his younger brother Corey said, “He used to go get me to talk to girls for him.”Even last season, as he led Alabama to a national championship, McCarron bristled at being called a game manager, a title still sort of attached to his name but in a complimentary way. There is a new appreciation for his role.McCarron and Notre Dame quarterback Everett Golson, who will meet in Monday night’s Bowl Championship Series title game, have managed and owned insecurities — McCarron over that label, Golson over being benched earlier this season. The difference, it appears, is how at ease McCarron seems, having done it all before.“He’s very secure and confident, maybe to a fault,” said Barrett Jones, McCarron’s roommate, who borrowed a dab of hair gel the other day. “I don’t know. I mean, he’s a quarterback; he’s an Alabama quarterback. You guys know how they are, that hairstyle, and he’s looking all fancy. All the ladies love Alabama quarterbacks.”For what it’s worth, McCarron is dating Miss Alabama 2012. Given more autonomy within the offense this season, McCarron, a junior, threw 26 touchdowns passes, a single-season team record, and only 3 interceptions. If game manager meant efficient, then it correctly applied. His quarterback efficiency rating (173) ranks second in the nation.Yes, he managed games, but he single-handedly won them, too, his teammates said.“A J last year was somebody who just filled in for our offense, just sort of managed the game,” tight end Michael Williams said. “A J this year was more of a leader, more vocal, more of everything that we needed to make this next step.”In November, McCarron led a 72-yard drive in 43 seconds, throwing a game-winning screen pass to T. J. Yeldon in the Crimson Tide’s victory over Louisiana State to stay unbeaten. Afterward, he embraced his parents and cried, overcome with the pressure, he said, of playing quarterback at Alabama.Yet McCarron did not flinch Saturday when he said that he had not been an Alabama fan all his life and that he once did not know much about the team’s proud past. On Monday, McCarron could become synonymous with that lore if he becomes the only Crimson Tide quarterback to win two national titles.“It’s the media that makes the game so much bigger,” McCarron said Saturday. “Me, personally, I think it’s just another game.”Later Saturday, a subdued Golson appeared in front of reporters, fielding questions about what a national title at Notre Dame would do for his legacy.Only about three months ago against Michigan, with his parents in the stands, he threw two interceptions and was benched in favor of Tommy Rees. Golson said he was mad at himself, disappointed and upset. In his up-and-down first season as a starter, this hurt the most. His teammates came to console him after the game. His coaches reminded him that they had named him the starter.“The Michigan game, he would’ve pulled himself,” said Chuck Martin, Notre Dame’s offensive coordinator. “He was a disaster.”Martin and Coach Brian Kelly benched Golson, for injury or ineptitude or discipline, in five games this season, and he sat out a sixth game with concussionlike symptoms. Golson, a sophomore, said it motivated him to improve, as he did later in the season. But Martin said he was not sure how the benchings affected Golson’s psyche early on.“Not only are you pulling him, but you’re pulling him for last year’s starter,” Martin said. “So there’s a little more there. But we kept trying to convince him: ‘Don’t worry; you’re our guy. Just if we take you out, we’re giving you a chance to breathe.’ But as a young kid, he may not have took it that way.”He added, “We were pulling him to try to win games.”The coaches evaluated Golson and compared him with Rees, week to week, Martin said. There was no plan, he acknowledged. In public, though, Kelly declared Golson the quarterback of the future and the present, an awkward juxtaposition for an undefeated team. At times, the Fighting Irish’s quarterback was holding them back.When he sat, Golson watched Rees and better understood the offense. Then Golson torched Oklahoma, which played a readable man-to-man defense and did not often mix its defensive fronts, Martin said, adding, “It wasn’t a mentally taxing day.”The next week against Pittsburgh, Golson was pulled and then reinserted in time to throw a touchdown and scramble and dive for the game-tying 2-point conversion. Notre Dame won in triple overtime, because of Golson. The benching had apparently calmed his nerves.“I really settled down, tried to get back to what I do best as a quarterback,” Golson said. “Just improvising, kind of just being me. I kind of played a little bit looser.”Alabama will try its best to oppress him, to blitz him, to charge him. Notre Dame will try the same with McCarron. Whichever quarterback proves most confident, most comfortable with himself, under that duress, will be the one whose legacy is most secure."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/arts/television/seinfeld-to-continue-comedians-in-cars-getting-coffee.html,"Jerry Seinfeld and Sony Pictures Television have decided to produce a second season of the short-run, experimental Internet series that Mr. Seinfeld created last year, “Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee,” a decision that mimics those made when a new comedy on television gets an order for a second season.But the whole idea behind the Internet show, Mr. Seinfeld said, was to try to break into a medium other than TV. The decision to produce 24 new episodes, to be announced Monday, puts Mr. Seinfeld and Sony on the same track as sites like Netflix — which has forthcoming series like “Arrested Development” and “House of Cards” — in testing the waters to see if original, network-quality entertainment can emerge on the Internet.“It’s kind of a new paradigm that we’re trying to create,” Mr. Seinfeld said in a telephone interview, referring to himself and Sony. “I think we both were craving that little sandbox feeling we had when we started out.”Now they need to chase the same thing that other creators of original Internet content have been after: profits.“This next go-round we’re going to have to figure out some sort of revenue stream, so it makes more sense,” Mr. Seinfeld said.The first 10 episodes of “Comedians in Cars” contain no advertising and appear free on the Sony Web site Crackle and at comediansincarsgettingcoffee.com, the show’s own site. The format is a talk show of sorts that features Mr. Seinfeld riding around in vintage cars with friends in the comedy business, making detours to converse over food and coffee. Steve Mosko, the president of Sony Pictures Television, said that almost as soon as Mr. Seinfeld’s new show began appearing, “high-end advertisers were banging on our doors” seeking some level of sponsorship. But, he said, Mr. Seinfeld did not want to turn the first season “into something that gets cluttered.”Mr. Seinfeld said he was taking ideas that held personal interest and adapting them for the Internet. “I thought of all the things I liked,” he said, which included almost anything about cars, talking with other comics, and coffee in its various forms. He put that together with his observation that all around him “people were watching stuff on phones and pads,” and he concluded, “Well, this is stuff I like, and this could be a match.”Besides, he said, the show might have special appeal for “comedy geeks,” who “were missing a little piece of the puzzle — the kind of idiotic relationships that we have that are a big part of this life.”Mr. Seinfeld said he never thought of the concept as something for traditional television; he loved the flexibility of the Internet, particularly no fixed duration for any of the episodes. (Each one runs about 11 to 17 minutes, and guests have included his old “Seinfeld” partner Larry David, Ricky Gervais, Alec Baldwin and Mel Brooks.)Mr. Seinfeld said he took the idea initially to executives at several Internet-based companies, drawing strong interest. “It was just too hard to explain, and they started asking the usual questions, and I started getting that not-good feeling: Oh, I’m back in the old game,” he said. “And I don’t want to play the old game. I played that game. I want to play a new game.”He turned to Sony because it distributes the repeats of his sitcom, and he had a good relationship with Mr. Mosko. Mr. Seinfeld owns the “Comedians in Cars” show, and Sony will continue to serve as backer and distributor.Mr. Mosko said the studio was more than pleased with the first season, which he said attracted more than 10 million unique visitors to Crackle. Developing Internet programming is a crucial part of Sony’s future, he said.“What’s missing in developing programming for the Internet is patience, trying to get it right,” he said. “We’re both looking at this as a long-term investment.”As for revenue streams, some form of sponsorship is likely to be attached to the new episodes when they start appearing this spring. But only if advertising can be integrated in the right way, Mr. Mosko said, adding, “We know there’s an opportunity there.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/07/business/media/for-legacy-media-companies-a-lucrative-year.html,"Everyone knows that traditional media companies are dead in the water, overwhelmed by ad skipping, cord cutting and audience flight. We know that because Chicken Littles (like me) have been saying it for years.Eventually we may be right — the sky will fall and the business will collapse — but for the time being, the sky over traditional media is blue and it’s raining green.In the last year, the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index was up 13.4 percent, which was a significant advance, but legacy media giants like Comcast, News Corporation and Time Warner absolutely surpassed it in terms of share price.Viacom, which has had serious ratings trouble with MTV and Nickelodeon, still managed to be up 16.1 percent on the year. We keep hearing how traditional networks are getting clobbered, but Viacom’s sibling, CBS, was up a whopping 40.2 percent.News Corporation, despite being racked by scandal, was up 43 percent, and fellow global media conglomerates like Disney and Time Warner were up more than 32 percent. And Comcast, which has both the pipes and programming — cable and NBCUniversal — soared 57.6 percent.(Pure cable and satellite providers like Time Warner Cable, Charter, Dish and DirecTV also did very well overall, with an average improvement in stock price of more than 40 percent.)What is making these dinosaurs dance? I called some media analysts and a few things quickly became apparent. To begin with, the companies collectively did not make dumb choices — consider the past acquisitions of AOL and The Wall Street Journal — and they made plenty of smart moves, including long-term deals that locked up content and a steady stream of fees.“The era of the media mogul is over, or at least on a very significant hiatus,” said David Bank, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, suggesting that companies would no longer get bigger for the sake of scale and nonexistent synergies. He added that most of the big media companies are, in one way or another, cable content companies with lots of leverage in negotiations when it comes to distribution.Probably more important, instead of spending billions on new properties, they paid out dividends and financed stock buybacks. And in the case of News Corporation, the company was split in a way that quarantined newspapers and pleased investors mightily.“The big change in the industry is that they are returning capital to shareholders,” said Jessica Reif Cohen, a media analyst at BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. “Balance sheets are stronger than they have been and the free cash flow is being returned to the investor. But it’s more than that. Disney, Comcast, News Corporation, they have all executed strategically as well.”And the worries about insurgent threats from tech-oriented players like Netflix, Amazon and Apple turned out to be overstated. Those digital enterprises were supposed to be trouncing media companies; not only is that not happening, but they are writing checks to buy content. New players have opened windows to sell content without cannibalizing the retransmission and affiliate fees that have turned into a gold mine for media companies.(Writing for Deadline Hollywood, David Lieberman pointed out that cranky old media far outperformed a sexy technology group composed of Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Yahoo, Google and Microsoft. Take that, digital overlords!)“As it turns out, the traditional television business is far stickier than people thought, and audience behavior is not changing as rapidly as people thought it might,” said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. “Yes, television viewing went down in 2012 for the first time, but people are still watching five hours a day. YouTube is growing, but people are watching eight minutes a day. They are where cable was in 1980.” But he added that it would not take YouTube and the Internet 30 years to overtake television.Another thing about those dinosaurs is that they aren’t really old media in the sense of, um, newspapers. When their content is digitized, it is generally monetized, not aggregated. Having learned from what happened in music and print publishing, entertainment companies, built on the still enormous riches of television, have carved their own digital route to consumers. Being big helps, because they can afford to make very large bets, as News Corporation has been recently in securing rights to sports programming all over the globe.There are many ways to unpack this, but let’s begin with the consumer experience. As viewers have begun to consume content at a time and a place of their choosing, legacy media companies have followed wherever they wander. Time Warner lets you bring HBO with your tablet as long as you sign in, and ditto for Disney’s ESPN, along with a host of other brand name entertainments. And while we could tape shows and skip all the commercials, why bother when whole seasons will be waiting on demand in our cable boxes?Between retransmission fees and on-demand viewing, broadcasters are starting to look a lot more like cable channels, less dependent on advertising and enjoying steadier revenue as a result. Not long ago, I watched CBS’s chief executive, Les Moonves, argue that everything that was supposed to be bad for his business — tablets, the growth of ad-supported cable, DVRs — was actually good for his business. And looking at his share price, you have to admit he is sort of right.We will skip past the cliché about content’s royal status, but suffice it to say that strong entertainment brands — the backbone of traditional media companies — are tough to build, tough to rub out and tough to compete against. Yes, cable and broadcast networks have to risk hundreds of millions to find a hit, kill off the losers and eat the costs. And then do it again for the next season. But once it works, it can kick up returns in more ways than one.Let’s use zombies as an example because, well, they’re zombies. I quit on Season 2 of AMC’s “Walking Dead” — I like a little story with my bloody entrails — but then started reading good things on Twitter about Season 3. I went back and watched a few episodes on demand (ka-ching), bought a few episodes on iTunes to bring with me on airplane rides (ka-ching) and then caught up with the midseason finale in real-time (ka-ching). And I will be there when the zombies march anew in February to finish the season. I was like an unstoppable zombie myself, ringing AMC’s cash register every time I turned around.Our house is lousy with tablets, and the wireless almost groans under the load of all the surfing, listening and downloading we do. But in the meantime, we wait for “Modern Family” to come back, the N.F.L. playoffs to swallow our weekends and episodes of “Justified” to start loading into our cable box.To paraphrase the science fiction novelist William Gibson, the future is here, it’s just distributed in a way that means legacy businesses are still thriving.“When last year started, everyone was worried that the Netflixes of the world would destroy the TV model as we know it,” said Michael Nathanson of Nomura Securities. “That didn’t happen. These companies are buying back their stock, which is good for investors, but it also means that they believe in the stability of their cash flow and aren’t as worried about what tomorrow will bring.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/sports/ncaafootball/in-their-nightmares-notre-dame-fans-will-see-42-in-red.html,"MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. — The Notre Dame Golden Domers had waited 24 years, and then the better part of six weeks, to flock here in anticipation of cheering their team onto a national title. Instead they sat with their arms folded, their caps lowered, slouched in their seats, despondent.They can thank Eddie Lacy for that.He ran at will, through arm tackles, over defenders, past Manti Te’o. Lacy made it look easy as he knifed through Notre Dame’s defense making certain the Fighting Irish would not go through Alabama, at least not this year, to win their first national championship since 1988.Like Mark Ingram and Trent Richardson before him, Lacy had his night atop college football as Alabama’s lead running back. Lacy made this title game his own, racking up 140 yards rushing and 2 touchdowns, one rushing and one receiving as the Crimson Tide rolled to a 42-14 victory that left Notre Dame spinning from the start and sealed the Tide’s third title in four years.Lacy wasted no time in keeping the Irish off balance, scoring on a 20-yard run on the Tide’s first possession of the game to set the tone.He then he caught a short pass in the red zone, spun tightly enough around two defenders to escape another converging attacker and scored with 31 seconds left in the first half. That touchdown put Alabama ahead, 28-0, and left Notre Dame wondering what it could do to stop him.Lacy said he was surprised with how easily he could run on the Irish defense.“Nobody would have expected that on this stage,” Lacy said. “But once you exploit it, you don't have a choice but to run with it.”He seemed to favor the left side of his offensive line, barreling behind the 311-pound left tackle, Cyrus Kouandjio, and his 320-pound left guard, Chance Warmack. Behind them, he finished the Crimson Tide’s opening drive with his 20-yard touchdown, clean up the gut, defenders diving at his ankles.The Notre Dame defense had not allowed a touchdown in the first quarter all season. By the end of the quarter, Lacy had 72 yards, averaging 9 yards a carry, and Alabama had outgained Notre Dame in total yardage by 202-23. Alabama led, 14-0, and it would soon be 21-0, then 28-0, then more and more.“Eddie’s always at his best, man,” guard Chance Warmack said. “He was feeling it just like everybody else was. We all had a mentality tonight to not be denied.”The Notre Dame defense that had won 12 games, that had allowed just 10.3 points per game, had already failed. Louis Nix III and Stephon Tuitt had been moved. Te’o, the Heisman Trophy runner-up, had been a nonfactor. If that ever seemed plausible, on this night, it was. Not even he could slow Lacy and Alabama by himself.With Lacy in his backfield, Alabama quarterback A J McCarron simply needed to fake handoffs to find his receivers open deep downfield. There, Kevin Norwood and Amari Cooper found themselves a step ahead, the Fighting Irish two steps behind.“It was kind of easy because they were so predictable,” said lineman D. J. Fluker, adding, “They ran the same things they did on film.”McCarron, who has won two titles now with the help of a healthy run game, threw four touchdown passes. Cooper, whose freshman season rivaled that of T. J. Yeldon, had 105 yards and 2 touchdowns. Yeldon, whose job was to spell Lacy, kept punishing Notre Dame, for 108 yards and his own touchdown."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/08/arts/television/jimmy-kimmel-moves-to-an-1135-showtime-on-abc.html,"And Jimmy makes three.Starting on Tuesday night, all three traditional broadcast networks will go head-to-head at 11:35 with entertainment-talk shows, as Jimmy Kimmel on ABC joins Jay Leno on NBC and David Letterman on CBS.“Yes, I’m helping to further cheapen the medium,” Mr. Kimmel said in a telephone interview.The truth is, Mr. Kimmel has worked doggedly for a decade to carve out his own identity in late night. And over the last several years, especially in 2012, Mr. Kimmel has begun to emerge as a well-respected, distinctive late-night star, one ABC finally deemed ready for the big stage, the show right after the late local newscasts.The decision to move Mr. Kimmel from his midnight start time meant displacing the award-winning late-night news program “Nightline.” But ABC’s management has, since 2002, been seeking to switch to entertainment in late night, for the simple reason that the advertising money is so much greater for an entertainment show. ABC tried to woo both Mr. Letterman and Mr. Leno over that period, while Mr. Kimmel persevered, improving his monologue skills, polishing his performing style and making increasingly clever use of videos that stamped his show as an original rather than an imitation.“Creatively, he’s ahead,” said Robert Morton, who produced Mr. Letterman at NBC and later CBS, as well as the more recent late-night series on TBS that starred George Lopez. Mr. Kimmel, he added, “has a more viral presence than the others and he is strong in social media.”The change at ABC was accomplished without any of the emotional bloodletting that accompanied NBC’s two efforts to update “Tonight”: first when Mr. Leno outmaneuvered Mr. Letterman and grabbed the chair left by the genre’s biggest star, Johnny Carson, and then when NBC tapped Conan O’Brien to succeed Mr. Leno — a move that ended calamitously, with Mr. O’Brien ousted, Mr. Leno restored, and both men’s careers damaged.  In contrast, Mr. Kimmel is sliding into the 11:35 slot with minimal drama. Not that there weren’t moments of frustration that accompanied the wait.“I was on 10 years of probation,” Mr. Kimmel said. “We always told ABC we were ready to move up whenever we got the call. But I didn’t have to push them. It was not one of those things where I said, ‘I’m not going to sign my contract unless we get 11:35.’ They did this on their own.”Jill Leiderman, Mr. Kimmel’s executive producer for the last seven years, said: “Jimmy earned this through his diligence and hard work. He is now polished. He’s become a signature voice. He’s a younger presence.”That point is not insignificant. At 45, Mr. Kimmel is much younger than Mr. Letterman (65) and Mr. Leno (62). According to one prevailing line of speculation about why ABC finally promoted Mr. Kimmel, the network wanted to establish him with younger viewers who have been defecting from the two aging superstars before NBC eventually installs its own rising late-night comic, Jimmy Fallon, 38, as Mr. Leno’s successor at “Tonight.”ABC may also have circumvented a raid by another network. “No one had formally approached me because I’ve been under contract the whole time,” Mr. Kimmel said. “But there has definitely been some sniffing around.”The last year has been by far the most prominent of Mr. Kimmel’s career. He hosted the Emmy Awards; served as the entertainment for the White House Correspondents’ Association Dinner; got engaged (to his head writer, Molly McNearney); and saluted Mr. Letterman (his childhood idol) on the Kennedy Center Honors program.  His show’s ratings also gained about 7 percent, to an average of just under two million viewers a night.At the Kennedy Center show, the possibility that the two late-night stars would soon become head-to-head competitors never came up, Mr. Kimmel said, noting, “I don’t think Dave cares.”He is convinced that Mr. Leno cares, however, and the fractiousness between the two has taken on the dimensions of a feud. Mr. Kimmel no longer modulates his shots at Mr. Leno (in a Rolling Stone interview this month he said, “As a comedian, you can’t not have disdain for what he’s done: He totally sold out.”)Executives who work on Mr. Kimmel’s show have noted that NBC has increased its promotional efforts on behalf of Mr. Leno and that in recent weeks “Tonight” has moved its formal starting time to 11:34.Mr. Leno tends to avoid responding to swats from competitors but usually doubles down on his competitive instincts.Mr. Morton predicted “a booking battle in L.A.,” with Mr. Kimmel and Mr. Leno fighting for the shrinking pool of A-level guests.For his first week at the new time, Mr. Kimmel seems to have loaded the stage. On Tuesday Jennifer Aniston will be the main guest, with the band No Doubt playing. Later in the week Sofia Vergara, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Bruno Mars, and Chris Paul of the Los Angeles Clippers will turn up.But Mr. Kimmel said the earlier show will mostly resemble the one he has been doing at midnight — aside from a new set. Familiar comedy segments will be part of the mix, though new ones will be added. “I don’t think anyone will notice any difference other than the set,” he said. “And hopefully they will be awake this time when we’re on.”But Ms. Leiderman said there would be one significant format change: “Instead of one long act of comedy, there will now be two long acts of comedy.” That is typical of the network 11:35 format, but Ms. Leiderman said that there would be more comedy over all, and that, unlike his competitors, Mr. Kimmel would not necessarily do a second comedy act behind his desk.“He may be staying at the monologue mark,” she said, referring to his place onstage, making his work seem like an extended monologue on some occasions.Mr. Kimmel said he might come up with yet another way to provide viewers with more of him. “I’m going to try to put on a hundred pounds through the course of the year,” he said. “That’s going to be my thing this year.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/technology/smartphones-can-now-run-consumers-lives.html,"LAS VEGAS — The smartphone is no longer just a portable computer in your pocket. It has become the remote control for your life.Want to flip off the living room lights, unlock your front door or get a reading of your blood pressure? All of this can be done through mobile apps that work with accessories embedded with sensors or an Internet connection.For several years, technology companies have promised the dream of the connected home, the connected body and the connected car. Those connections have proved illusory. But in the last year app-powered accessories have provided the mechanism to actually make the connections. That is partly because smartphones have become the device people never put down. But it is also because wireless sensors have become smaller, cheaper and ubiquitous.Big companies with strong brands have been heavily promoting the new uses for these gadgets. General Motors advertises its Chevy Malibu Eco  with a man showing his parents how he starts the car with a smartphone. A major selling point of the popular Nest thermostat is its ability to turn up the furnace from miles away with a cellphone.“Now that, increasingly, consumers have a device with them to monitor virtually anything they do with the Internet, why not offer that capability to monitor and remote control?” said Ross Rubin, an analyst at Reticle Research.The idea of turning off the lights with a smartphone may seem gimmicky, but consumers are warming to applications, said Bill Scheffler, director of business development for the Z-Wave Alliance, a consortium of companies that make connected appliances. The situation resembles the time when power windows started catching on for automobiles, or when television makers started offering remote controls, Mr. Scheffler said.“It used to be that people would say, ‘Why does anybody want a remote control for a TV if you can get up and change the channel?’ ” he said. “It’s just progress.” Companies like AT&T, Black & Decker and Honeywell have started selling app-linked products, he said.At the International Consumer Electronics Show, which has attracted more than 150,000 people here this week, dozens of companies are showing off connected accessories they can hook up to their home appliances to make them work with smartphones, and many are also displaying wearable devices that can help people monitor their health on their phones. Some of these products are being provided by large companies. AT&T, the wireless carrier, said that in March it would begin selling a wireless security system called Digital Life that will allow people to use tablets or phones to monitor cameras, alarms and even coffee pots.If a burglar trips a motion sensor in the house, for example, a user can receive a text message, then call the police. Customers can choose to expand AT&T’s wireless service to appliances like lights, door locks, thermostats and security cameras, which can be controlled and monitored through the AT&T mobile app.Ralph de la Vega, chief executive of AT&T Mobility, said in an interview that home security was a big opportunity to increase revenue. Only 20 percent of homes have security systems, he said, leaving millions of homeowners as potential buyers.“I think it dramatically changes how people feel about their home and how secure they feel about being outside the home,” Mr. de la Vega said. “I think it’s an easy sell.” The company has not announced prices for the service.Ingersoll Rand, which makes industrial products, offers a $300 starter kit and software for people to connect their homes. It includes a lock, a light and a wireless “bridge,” or base station, to connect the devices to the Internet. They can be controlled with a smartphone or tablet app called Nexia Home Intelligence. Customers also must pay at least $9 a month for a subscription; they can choose to buy the appliances and the bridge separately.Products by several other companies take advantage of a smartphone’s sensors and connection to the Internet to monitor consumers’ health. IHealth sells monitors for people to track their blood pressure with an app. At the electronics show, it introduced a wireless glucose meter, called the Smart Glucometer, that lets people with diabetes determine their blood sugar. A user puts a blood sample on a test strip, pops it into an accessory attached to a smartphone, and an app gives a reading of the blood sugar level.Adam Lin, general manager of iHealth, declined to say how many products the company had sold, but he said it was in the “six-figure” area. IHealth products have appeared at Apple, Target and Best Buy.In addition to people who are interested in their health, health insurance providers might embrace monitoring products. Mr. Lin said iHealth was discussing with two insurers whether to provide its products to patients, which would help reduce their doctor visits.A small start-up, AliveCor, has created an iPhone case that, when grasped, records an accurate electrocardiogram on the iPhone screen via its app. The company has attracted financing from Khosla Ventures, a prominent Silicon Valley venture capital firm.Nike, Jawbone and Fitbit sell wearable electronic devices for people to track their movements with smartphones. Fitbit, based in San Francisco, sells a pocket pedometer called the Fitbit One, which can track a user’s steps and floors climbed, and also monitors sleep patterns. Its newest product is due in spring, the Fitbit Flex, a step counter and sleep tracker that is worn around the wrist. It synchronizes with a smartphone app to give users updates.Woody Scal, chief revenue officer of Fitbit, said the company sold its devices in 10,000 retail stores in the United States. Its Fitbit One is the best-selling sports device on Amazon.com. He said one reason that wearable fitness gadgets had become popular was that the sensors had shrunk and battery life had improved. That helps make the products slimmer, more stylish and easier to use.Mr. Scal said wireless fitness devices were becoming popular because they addressed basic needs for consumers, unlike another trend seen at the show, enormous televisions.“In the end, I don’t wake up in the morning, look myself in the mirror and ask whether my TV has enough pixels,” he said. “But I do wonder how I’m going to get enough exercise, eat better, sleep well or manage my weight despite all the other things going on in my life.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/nyregion/yoko-ono-in-albany-raises-her-voice-against-hydraulic-fracturing.html,"ALBANY — For months they have been descending on Albany: farmers, environmentalists, latter-day hippies and placard-bearing parents.But on Friday, the forces against hydraulic fracturing, a method for drilling for natural gas, brought to Albany a face and a voice familiar to the world: Yoko Ono.Ms. Ono — along with her son, Sean Lennon, who came with her — has a personal connection to the issue. She and her husband, John Lennon, bought a farm in the Catskills, and she and Sean want to prevent the drilling, also known as fracking, near that property, and everywhere else.Mother and son — she wearing a newsboy hat, and he a fedora — gathered with other environmental advocates to talk to reporters before walking over to Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo’s office and then driving to the state Department of Environmental Conservation to deliver 50 boxes of what they said were 204,000 anti-drilling comments.“Fracking kills, and it doesn’t just kill us,” Ms. Ono said. “It kills the land, nature and, eventually, the whole world.”The governor and members of the Legislature were not in Albany on Friday, and reporters and TV cameras packed into a drab seventh-floor conference room in a legislative office building to catch a glimpse of Ms. Ono, a longtime peace advocate who has spoken out against sexism and racism, and in favor of same-sex marriage.Mr. Lennon said the family’s opposition to the drilling began with concerns about its upstate farm.Speaking of his father, Mr. Lennon said, “He loved it there because we had our own well water.”“The reason I started all this,” he added, “was because Cabot Oil was proposing a Constitution pipeline which really goes on the border of our house. And I wanted to save my own house and drink the water first, and then it sort of escalated from there. That house was my dad’s house and still is, so I’m sure he would’ve been on our side.”In hydraulic fracturing, sand, water and chemicals are injected deep underground at high pressures to extract natural gas from rock formations.The governor’s administration is expected to make a decision next month about whether to allow the drilling in New York State.Facing unrelenting opposition from activists and residents on the left of the Democratic Party, Mr. Cuomo has not acted on a plan his administration had developed to approve the drilling in counties along the Pennsylvania border. The administration has been studying the health impacts, but has closely held information about its findings.Ms. Ono warned that the fight would not stop even if hydraulic fracturing were approved.“If they do this, there will be a class action, and the class action is going to hit everybody who is doing this,” she said, adding: “It’s going to go on and on and on. Do we want that?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/sports/football/with-49ers-teachers-grade-hinges-on-students-playoff-test.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — In his only planned meeting with local reporters before Saturday’s playoff game against Green Bay, 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick was asked 23 questions in five minutes.The average query and response consumed 13 seconds, hardly enough time for enlightenment. Eighteen of the 23 answers were more succinct than the questions, including the last one.“You don’t like to reveal a whole lot, which you might have in common with your coach,” a reporter began. “Why is that?”“The more that you reveal, the less of an advantage you have,” Kaepernick said. With that, he walked away.Presuming Jim Harbaugh was not hidden behind Kaepernick like a ventriloquist with a hand up his jersey, the coach must have been pleased with his student’s performance. It was straight from Harbaugh’s public relations playbook.Kaepernick is Harbaugh’s quarterback, molded in Harbaugh’s stony persona. He was drafted for the purpose of eventually leading Harbaugh’s team and was promoted in November to carry Harbaugh’s immediate championship aspirations.So the attention in these playoffs is on Kaepernick. But it is the man behind him, working the controls, who has the most at stake.Harbaugh is perched at a peculiar turning point in his coaching career. He is popular in the Bay Area because he has won, not because he is liked, relying on victories instead of personality to build good will. Now, because of the midseason switch to Kaepernick, and the rising expectations caused by his own success, Harbaugh’s popularity promises to be tested as never before.“Two things sustain you as a coach,” said the former quarterback Trent Dilfer, an ESPN analyst who lives in the Bay Area. “Winning, No. 1. Likability, No. 2. Very few coaches have both. Jim does not have the consciousness of the public perception of him to have sustainability unless he wins. That’s just a fact. He has to win.”So far, Harbaugh has won plenty. After four seasons of resurrecting Stanford into a powerhouse, in part behind quarterback Andrew Luck, Harbaugh moved triumphantly to the nearby 49ers in 2011.His wealth of confidence and dash of intensity lifted San Francisco’s enviable roster to a 13-3 record. The 49ers came within one game of last year’s Super Bowl, losing to the Giants, 20-17, in overtime last January.For the first time, he faces the full weight of expectation. The 49ers feel built for a championship. And Harbaugh, in his final tinkering, benched the rejuvenated and widely admired Alex Smith for the unleashed potential of Kaepernick.“If it all blows up on Saturday, that will take a lot of that good will out of the bank,” said Steve Young, the Hall of Fame quarterback who led San Francisco to its last Super Bowl, 18 years ago.Before November, a key to the franchise’s renewal was Harbaugh’s rehabilitation of Smith. He was the first overall draft choice in 2005, tested and abandoned by a string of failing coaches. Harbaugh turned him into a trustworthy player of robotic efficiency.On Oct. 29, Smith completed 18 of 19 passes for 232 yards and 3 touchdowns in a victory over the Cardinals. The 49ers were 6-2. Two days later, Smith and Harbaugh chauffeured cars in the San Francisco Giants’ World Series victory parade. It was easy to imagine a Super Bowl parade come winter.But Smith left the next game with a concussion, after throwing a touchdown pass through blurry vision. Kaepernick started the next game, against the Bears. His poise and pinpoint passing led the 49ers to a prime-time blowout victory.Smith recovered. He had the league’s highest passer rating. He had completed 25 of his previous 27 passes, for 304 yards and 4 touchdowns. He had led the 49ers to a 19-5 regular-season record under Harbaugh, including a season-opening 30-22 victory at Green Bay in September.Harbaugh, somewhat clumsily over a couple of weeks, handed the job to Kaepernick.“For the first time, fans have a little bit of pause about Harbaugh,” said Brian Murphy, who co-hosts a morning sports radio show in San Francisco. “Because it’s the first thing that isn’t perfectly aligned with good feelings and wins.”The debate among fans has swirled since, funnel-like, all spilling into the story line of Saturday’s game. Now people will know whether it was the right move.“He went all in,” Young said. “But that’s Jim.”Harbaugh remains a bit of a mystery in San Francisco, stalking the sidelines in a black sweatshirt tucked into khaki pants. He can be hard to read behind his revolving kaleidoscope of expressions: perplexed, angry, smiling, wild-eyed, sometimes all at once.He has a reputation, dating to his 14 years as an N.F.L. quarterback, for being a pugnacious sort. He once broke his hand punching the retired quarterback Jim Kelly because he did not like Kelly’s critiques.He is the rare coach to pick spats with opposing coaches, including a handshake controversy. Excited after a victory at Detroit in 2011, Harbaugh brusquely shook the hand of Lions Coach Jim Schwartz and slapped his back while jogging past. Schwartz, miffed, chased Harbaugh down. Players surrounded the coaches in a scrum.“I shook his hand too hard,” Harbaugh said later, calling it a “slap-grab handshake.” Without apologizing, he said, “That was on me.”When the Giants offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride said this season that 49ers defensive lineman Justin Smith “gets away with murder” — part of an otherwise complimentary assessment — Harbaugh issued a statement. It demonstrated, among other things, a loyalty to his team and a flair for hyperbole.“Kevin Gilbride’s outrageous, irrational statement regarding Justin Smith’s play is, first, an absurd analogy,” Harbaugh said. “Second, it is an incendiary comment targeting one of the truly exemplary players in this league. It’s obvious that the Giants coaching staff’s sole purpose is to use their high visibility to both criticize and influence officiating.”In the locker room and on the practice field, Harbaugh is high energy. “Attack each day with an enthusiasm unknown to mankind” is an axiom he brandishes regularly, handed down from his father, Jack, a longtime football coach. (John Harbaugh, Jim’s brother, coaches the Baltimore Ravens.)But little of that is on display to the broader world. During news conferences and television interviews, Harbaugh looks like a man distracted, as if he were perpetually trying to remember if he left the coffee maker on at home. He has no aversion to awkward silences, and can rival Bill Belichick’s ability for spoken minimalism.On Monday, a reporter reminded Harbaugh that he said San Francisco’s division was “arguably the best.”“Arguably,” Harbaugh said.The reporter asked if he wanted to bolster the argument, given the playoff victory of the rival Seahawks.“Yeah, I’m willing to go further, a week later, to continue to argue that,” Harbaugh said. “I think that’s a fair argument.”So you think it is the toughest division?“Arguably the toughest division,” Harbaugh said.The reporter, tugging hard on the verbal leash, asked what made it so tough.“The strength of the teams,” Harbaugh said.Occasionally, a memorable line helps take the edge off Harbaugh’s persona of quirky intensity. Earlier this season, Harbaugh described public concern over Alex Smith’s confidence as “gobble gobble turkey.”And, coach, what is gobble gobble turkey?“Just gobble gobble gobble turkey from jive turkey gobblers, you know,” Harbaugh said with a smile.On Wednesday, during a typically laborious news conference, Harbaugh said that the injured Justin Smith would play, “God willing and the creek don’t rise.”Someone later asked Harbaugh if he was a fan of the entertainer Tennessee Ernie Ford.“Who isn’t?” Harbaugh said.You just quoted him, Harbaugh was told. (Actually, Ford’s catchphrase usually began, “The good Lord willing.”)“That was Tennessee Ernie Ford?” Harbaugh replied. “I thought that was Jack Harbaugh.”Performances like that, while hardly necessary to win football games, could go a long way toward endearing Harbaugh to the masses cheering him on. And maybe they will rub off on Kaepernick, his intriguingly talented, tight-lipped quarterback.Or the two of them could just keep winning games.“There’s a tremendous amount of pressure on Saturday night for the decision,” Murphy, the radio host, said of the lingering quarterback controversy. “A lot is on No. 7. And a lot is on the guy in the black sweatshirt and khakis.”"

Mr. Pattinson’s portrayal of a passionate, potentially dangerous husband capable of sexual rough play “shifts the story into another world,” said Manohla Dargis, writing in The New York Times. “Mr. Condon works in that world fluidly, gilding it with a necessary sense of humor — Bella and Edward’s white honeymoon bed glows as portentously as an altar for a sacrificial virgin — and imbuing it with a love and a gift for melodrama. He slathers on the music (‘melodrama’ comes from song or music drama), lets Ms. Stewart rock and the emotions roil. He resurrects the awkward teenage yearning that enlivened the first ‘Twilight’ movie, but also transforms that initial, crude hunger into something deeper. Mostly, he brings Bella toward her happily-ever-after by giving this movie over to her, her dreams and her desires, as in a cosmic montage sequence worthy of ‘The Tree of Life,’ but, you know, shorter.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/your-money/taxes/coping-with-the-new-tax-law-even-for-the-richest-of-the-rich.html,"WHILE the affluent will pay more in taxes this year, that is probably not the case for the very wealthiest — those worth hundreds of millions or more. They may still be paying a lower tax rate than Warren Buffett’s secretary.Many millionaires are certainly paying at least 30 percent of their income in taxes, a goal President Obama set out in last year’s State of the Union address. But they’re more likely to be doctors, lawyers and people working in the financial services industry who get the bulk of their earnings in the form of paychecks.Partners in private equity firms and hedge fund managers, on the other hand, earn much of their money as a share of their funds’ earnings. And that income gets preferential tax treatment as so-called carried interest.A similar special tax treatment still holds true for Mr. Buffett as long as the bulk of his income comes from his investments and not a paycheck. The long-term capital gains rate for incomes over $400,000 is 23.8 percent, including the Medicare surcharge. That’s a far cry from the top marginal tax rate on income above that amount of 40.5 percent, which includes a 0.9 percent Medicare surcharge on earned income.How are people going to react to all of this? Here is advice and observations from some experts in wealth management:INCOME ISSUES This year, income taxes are going up for almost everyone, even if the taxes go by different names. Greg Rosica, a tax partner at Ernst & Young and a contributing author to the firm’s tax guide, laid out five tiers where taxes are increasing.The bottom one includes everyone who receives a paycheck and is affected by the 2 percentage point increase in the payroll tax. In the top one are couples making more than $450,000 a year, who will pay higher rates on income and investments, be subject to the Medicare surcharges of 0.9 percent on income and 3.8 percent on investments and lose some portion of their itemized deductions and exemptions.Using assumptions on wages and deductions from Internal Revenue Service statistics, Mr. Rosica calculated that a person making $500,000 a year would pay $9,124, or 7 percent, more in taxes in 2013. A couple earning $1 million a year in wages and business and investment income would pay $53,350 extra, or 20 percent more in taxes.“It’s hitting every line item of income,” he said. “It’s phasing in all the way up the scale.” This has made strategies that defer income more attractive than they were in the years when George W. Bush was president and tax rates were historically low. “At the base level, it’s 401(k) plans. Or, for the self-employed person or person who sits on boards, they can defer into a SEP I.R.A.,” a retirement plan for the self-employed, or into one’s own defined-benefit plan, said Christopher Zander, the national head of wealth planning at Evercore Wealth Management. “That’s very attractive. Even if income tax rates are higher later, I think the tax deferral” makes up for that increase.There are risks, though. People could defer too much into a qualified plan, like an I.R.A., and end up having to pay a penalty if they need the money before they turn 59 1/2 years old. Or they could put too much into a company-sponsored deferred-compensation plan and face two problems. The company could go bankrupt, as Lehman Brothers did, and they could lose that money, or the payout schedule they selected when they put the money in — say 10 annual payments at retirement — may end up providing them with too much or too little income.CARRIED-INTEREST CONUNDRUM At the very top of the income ladder, the group for whom the changes in the tax code will not hurt as much includes people like hedge fund managers and private equity partners whose earnings come in the form of carried interest. The income for these people comes from the fees they charge, and that income will continue to be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income.“Carried interest rules are helpful for hedge fund managers, but they’re incredibly helpful for private equity guys,” said Richard A. Rosenberg, a certified public accountant and co-founder of RR Advisory Group, which advises hedge fund and private equity partners. “Private equity funds typically get the stronger treatment because there is less turnover and the holding periods of the funds are longer.”How the partners’ share is taxed depends on how the underlying investments are taxed. In the case of private equity, many of the investments are held for longer than a year. Through last year, the distributions would have been taxed at the long-term capital gains rate, which was 15 percent. Even now, the rate is still a relatively low 20 percent for an individual earning above $400,000.In the case of a hedge fund, the earnings are probably a combination of various rates, like short- and long-term capital gains, dividend and interest income, with capital losses factored in. Still, the rate on the carried interest is likely to be lower than the rate paid by someone who earns a high salary.But for individuals who invest in private equity and hedge funds, the tax situation will be worse. Since they have little control over when those managers buy and sell things — and at what rate those investments get taxed — advisers said that it may be more beneficial to own those investments in tax-deferred accounts.SMALL BUSINESS BURDENS Despite what both political parties say about the importance of small-business owners for creating jobs, the new tax rates will adversely effect everyone whose businesses are set up so their earnings flow through to their individual income tax returns.J. Leigh Griffith, a lawyer and partner at Waller, a national law firm based in Nashville, said many in this group would be paying taxes at a higher marginal rate than big corporations like I.B.M. and General Electric. He said about half of all companies today were structured as so-called pass-through entities.“Both parties have talked about how our corporate rate of 35 percent, which is the highest in the developed world, puts us at a competitive disadvantage,” Mr. Griffith said. But we take a 35 percent bracket on pass-through business entities and raise it to 39.6 percent plus the investment tax.”While he said it was too early to quantify the impact this will have, these business owners will probably have to pay higher rates of interest to borrow money. And some business owners may become frustrated and look to shelter more money from taxes. While many legitimate vehicles exist, like profit-sharing plans or defined-benefit plans, he said he was concerned that some small-business owners would turn to tax avoidance schemes.He said this year was only eight days old when he heard of the first tax shelter linking itself to the new law (which was signed on Jan. 2): it was an offer to invest in a film with a 100 percent tax write-off on the investment — and a producer credit.INVESTING WITH TAXES IN MIND In an ideal world, taxes would be seen as a way to raise revenue for necessary services and wouldn’t prompt people to change their behavior to avoid them. But this isn’t an ideal world.Beyond risky tax shelters, there are other, seemingly sensible investments that, when overdone, can also have adverse effects on any long-term investment plan. The interest payments on municipal bonds are tax-free, but not every city or service that issues municipal bonds is equally solid. And municipal bonds are still subject to capital gains tax when sold.Seth J. Finkel, managing director at Neuberger Berman Wealth Management, said some clients were looking at investing in master-limited partnerships — many of which operate pipelines — because they are not taxed at the corporate level and the dividends are structured so the entire amount is not subject to tax. But there is an inherent risk in anything that relies on transporting natural resources because demand can vary.“We want to look at the bottom line and not make bad decisions,” Mr. Finkel said. “But taxes do matter.” For people with large holdings of stock that have appreciated greatly over the year and are subject to a 23.8 percent tax, Mr. Zander said there was the temptation to put those shares into exchange funds — essentially a pool of other highly appreciated stock — or buy so-called collars that keep the price within a particular range.“Many times, the decision becomes to sell outright, even though rates are higher,” Mr. Zander said. “There’s immediate diversification and less administrative hassle.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/arts/music/bluebeard-by-33-1-3-collective-at-3ld-art-technology-center.html,"“Bluebeard” is about wanting to know the unknowable. The rich old man of the title entrusts his young wife with the keys to his castle, warning of a single room she must not enter.Of course, this being a fairy tale, she wants to enter that room, where she finds the bloodied corpses of her husband’s past wives. It’s unsurprising that this surreal, gruesomely dramatic parable has found its way again and again into opera, theater, ballet and film.The Dutch artistic collaborative 331/3 Collective emphasizes the surrealism in its abstracted take on the story. Part video art installation and part musical monologue, this “Bluebeard” fits snugly into the adventurous new Prototype festival of projects on the borders of theater, opera and music performance.The set, at the 3LD Art & Technology Center, is a large cube onto which hallucinatory video images are projected. The stylized scenes range from a pair of running legs to a bird’s-eye view of a Middle East city under siege.Three-dimensionality is convincingly evoked, and the performers (Douwe Dijkstra, Jules van Hulst and Coen Huisman, who are also the filmmakers and the members of the collective) vividly interact with the images — seeming, in one chilling sequence, to sweep up bodies.Ominous rattles and suave jazz fill the soundscape, created by Michael de Roo, and the vocal lines, sung by Stephanie Pan, are eclectic, ranging in style from Stephen Sondheim’s quieter side to the atonal shrieks of Schoenberg’s “Pierrot Lunaire.” “Blood-soaked” and “death” pop up a lot in the lyrics.The 40-minute piece occasionally slackens, but at its strongest it peers at the world closely and strangely. Early on there is footage of a key being slowly inserted into an arm. That grotesque, riveting image sums up in an instant the potent mixture of violence and mystery at the heart of the Bluebeard story."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/12/health/us-flu-deaths-reach-epidemic-levels-but-may-be-peaking.html,"Deaths in the current flu season have officially crossed the line into “epidemic” territory, federal health officials said Friday, adding that, on the bright side, there were also early signs that the caseloads could be peaking.Officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, speaking on a telephone news conference, again urged Americans to keep getting flu shots. At the same time, they emphasized that the shots are not infallible: a preliminary study rated this year’s vaccine as 62 percent effective, even though it is a good match for the most worrisome virus circulating. That corresponds to a rating of “moderately” effective — the vaccine typically ranges from 50 percent to 70 percent effective, they said.Even though deaths stepped — barely — into epidemic territory for the first time last Saturday, the C.D.C. officials expressed no alarm, and said it was possible that new flu infections were peaking in some parts of the country. “Most of the country is seeing a lot of flu and that may continue for weeks,” said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the C.D.C.’s director.New outpatient cases — a measure based on what percentage of doctor visits were for colds or flu — dropped off slightly from the previous week, to 4 percent from 6 percent. The trend was more pronounced in the South, where this year’s season began.Dr. Frieden cautioned that the new flu figures could be aberrations because they were gathered as the holiday season was ending. Few people schedule routine checkups then, so the percentage of visits for severe illness can be pushed artificially high for a week or two, then inevitably drop.Deaths from pneumonia and the flu, a wavy curve that is low in summer and high in winter, typically touch the epidemic level for one or two weeks every flu season. How bad a season is depends on how high the deaths climb for how long.So far this season, 20 children with confirmed flu tests have died, but that is presumably lower than the actual number of deaths because not all children are tested and not all such deaths are reported. How many adults die will not be estimated until after the season ends, said Dr. Joseph Bresee, the chief of prevention and epidemiology for the C.D.C.’s flu branch. Epidemiologists count how many death certificates are filed in a flu year, compare the number with normal years, and estimate what percentage were probably flu-related.Many people are getting ill this year because the country is also having widespread outbreaks of two diseases with overlapping symptoms, norovirus and whooping cough, and the normal winter surge in common colds. Flu shots have no effect on any of those.Spot shortages of vaccines have been reported, and there will not be enough for all Americans, since the industry has made and shipped only about 130 million doses. But officials said they would be pleased if 50 percent of Americans got shots; in a typical year, 37 percent do.Dr. Bresee said that this year’s epidemic resembles that of 2003-4, which also began early, was dominated by an H3N2 strain and killed more Americans than usual.Nevertheless, more Americans now routinely get flu shots than did then, and doctors are much quicker to prescribe Tamiflu and Relenza, drugs that can lessen a flu’s severity if taken early.The C.D.C.’s vaccine effectiveness study bore out the point of view of a report released last year by the University of Minnesota’s Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy. It said that the shot’s effectiveness had been “overpromoted and overhyped,” said Michael T. Osterholm, the center’s director.Although the report supported getting flu shots, it said that new vaccines offering lifelong protection against all flu strains, instead of annual partial protection against a mix-and-match set, must be created.“But there’s no appetite to fund that research,” Dr. Osterholm said in an interview Friday.“To get a vaccine across the ‘Valley of Death’ is likely to cost $1 billion,” he added, referring to the huge clinical trials that would be needed to approve a new type of vaccine. “No government has put more than $100 million into any candidate, and the private sector has no appetite for it because there’s not enough return on investment.”At the same time, he praised the C.D.C. for measuring vaccine effectiveness in midseason.“We’re the only ones in the world who have data like that,” he said.“Vaccine effectiveness” is a very different metric from vaccine-virus match, which is done in a lab. Vaccine efficacy is measured by interviewing hundreds of sick or recovering patients who had positive flu tests and asking whether and when they had received shots.Only people sick enough to visit doctors get flu tests, said Thomas Skinner, a C.D.C. spokesman, so the metric means the shot “reduces by 62 percent your chance of getting a flu so bad that you have to go to a doctor or hospital.”During the telephone news conference Friday, Dr. Frieden repeatedly described the vaccine as “far from perfect, but by far the best tool we have to prevent influenza.”Most vaccinations given in childhood for threats like measles and diphtheria are 90 percent effective or better. But flu viruses mutate so fast that they must be remade annually. Scientists are trying to develop vaccines that target bits of the virus that appear to stay constant, like the stem of the hemagglutinin spike that lets the virus break into lung cells.During the 2009 swine flu pandemic, many elderly Americans had natural protection, presumably from flus they caught in the 1930s or ’40s.“Think about that,” Dr. Osterholm said. “Even though they were old, they were still protected. We’ve got to figure out how to capture that kind of immunity — which current vaccines do not.”At Friday’s news conference, Dr. Bresee acknowledged the difficulties, saying: “If I had the perfect answer as to how to make a better flu vaccine, I’d probably get a Nobel Prize.”"

After all these years — and despite a long-ago change in ownership — the record store looks frozen in time: the same 1980s red-letter sign and awning hangs out front; the white-and-tan facade has been immune to the decades; even the carpet retains a Me Decade hue.“I feel emotionally connected to the place; a lot of us feel that way,” said Tere Batista Worland, who grew up nearby and trolled the aisles for Elton John and Led Zeppelin, later becoming an executive at Universal Music. “It was a big part of my childhood. It’s where we all bought our first records, where we went to see pop artists. It was a huge part of my growing up. It marks the end of an era.”For generations, Spec’s was the place where teeny-boppers and musicians, hippies and squares, classical music lovers and punk rockers, blue-haired ladies and purple-haired youths all congregated in the search for vinyl, eight-tracks, reel-to-reel, cassettes and, finally, CDs. Students, many from the University of Miami, which is across the street, camped out for concert tickets. Fans lined the block to get an autograph from Plácido Domingo. The Bee Gees once played an acoustic set among the record bins. Bruce Hornsby shopped there.Martin Spector, a former talent agent and violinist from Virginia, opened the store in 1948 on U.S. 1, then just a two-lane road. The shop sold records and cameras. Five years later, he moved the store a few blocks north on U.S. 1 to its permanent location and zeroed in almost exclusively on records for a few decades. Classical music was Mr. Spector’s specialty, although he sold all genres. He treated customers like members of an exclusive music club, and that kept the people coming back.By the 1970s, Spec’s grew to become a record powerhouse in Miami and the region. It influenced music charts with its ability to move records and promote songs, and it nurtured the local music scene. In 1985, Spec’s went public and continued to thrive for more than a decade until the rise of downloadable music. Spec’s was recognized by Forbes in 1987 as one of the 200 best small companies in America.Mr. Spector’s work ethic was legendary; he kept an office in the Coral Gables store, its flagship, and always made the rounds. He chose employees wisely. And he stayed a step ahead of tastes and trends, ushering in Latin music when he saw Miami’s population shift, building a renowned classical collection, selling concert tickets, hosting artists, and then adding movie rentals when necessary. At its peak, Spec’s grew to 80 stores in Florida and Puerto Rico. In 1998, Spec’s was sold to Camelot, which was later bought by Trans World Entertainment. Mr. Spector died in 2003 at age 98.The companies that bought out Spec’s considered it wise to keep the Spec’s name and the store’s same design. And so it remains.“It was the place to be,” said Ann Spector Lieff, Mr. Spector’s daughter who took the helm of Spec’s in 1980 and is now a consultant. “I think the new owners saw the value in the name. I think they got it, and that was very gratifying to all of us.”Pascale Laurent, 48, who grew up nearby and got word in Africa, where she now lives, that Spec’s was closing, felt an immediate pang. She landed a job there in the early ’80s, a coup for a high school student. She earned $3.35 an hour and invaluable perks: first dibs on concert tickets, free records and flawless on-the-job music. One afternoon, she ushered around the pop singer and soap actor Rick Springfield as he signed autographs.“There was something about how cool it felt and looked to be there,” said Ms. Laurent, who stayed on four years. “It was a place where people came to find something they loved — music.”Flipping through the last remaining jazz CDs, Morrie Hollander, 78, said he started making pilgrimages to Spec’s 30 years ago. “This is my nook-and-cranny,” he said, of the jazz section, lamenting the store’s passing.The old building will be leveled, and Chase Bank, with more than 280 branches in the state, will occupy a new structure this year.“Just what we need,” Mr. Hollander said. “Another bank.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/arts/television/adam-driver-christopher-abbott-alex-karpovsky-of-girls.html,"FOR a show that is, down to its title, about women, “Girls” pays a lot of attention to its boys. The male characters — boyfriends, exes, bosses, frenemies — are fleshed out in a way that’s unusual for an ensemble comedy, especially one aimed at the other gender. (How long did audiences have to wait for Mr. Big’s mere name on “Sex and the City”?)The actors who play the paramours and foils to Hannah, Jessa, Marnie and Shoshanna were largely unknown, and have already become so identifiable as personalities that it’s possible to tell someone meaningfully that he’s being a total Ray. Whether being a Ray is desirable is changing too; a hallmark of these leads is that they shift from hard-to-get bros to lovelorn mates rather quickly. (Wish fulfillment on the part of the show’s creator, Lena Dunham, perhaps, or just an accurate depiction of the morphing sensibilities of 21st-century dudes.)In exploring the lives of 20-something women coming of age in Brooklyn, this HBO series — led by Ms. Dunham, the writer, director, executive producer and star, and the executive producers Judd Apatow and Jenni Konner, along with a writing-producing staff of three women and three men — has created new careers for its male stars: Alex Karpovsky, as the motormouthed Ray, who at the end of Season 1 deflowered Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet); Adam Driver, as Adam, the intense slacker who romances, in his own way, Hannah (Ms. Dunham); and Christopher Abbott, as Charlie, the long-suffering beau of Marnie (Allison Williams). Off screen these guys really do live in Brooklyn (and have never watched “Sex and the City”).All also have thriving projects outside the show. Mr. Driver, 29, a Juilliard graduate and a veteran of the Marines, runs a nonprofit, Arts in the Armed Forces, that stages theatrical performances for the military. Mr. Karpovsky, who gave his age only as 30-something, is a multi-hyphenate filmmaker in his own right; “Rubberneck” and “Red Flag,” the last two indies he wrote, directed and starred in, will be released by Tribeca Film in February. Both actors have been cast in the next Coen brothers feature, “Inside Llewyn Davis,” and Mr. Driver is currently on screen in a small but pivotal part in “Lincoln.”Mr. Abbott, 26, is working on a feature with Brady Corbet, his co-star from the well-regarded 2011 drama “Martha Marcy May Marlene.” Unprompted they all mentioned the director and actor John Cassavetes as a model for the kind of creative life they’d like to lead; Mr. Abbott jokingly took credit for making the reference first.In interviews at cafes near their homes — Williamsburg for Mr. Karpovsky, Greenpoint for Mr. Abbott and Brooklyn Heights for Mr. Driver — they spoke about their lives, which mostly haven’t changed, how their characters were first described and what to expect in the second season, which begins Sunday. Here are excerpts from their conversations:Q. How do your characters evolve this season?ADAM DRIVER I feel like Adam is surprised how intense his feelings are for Hannah. I don’t think he really took it seriously until there was the threat of it not being there anymore. For the first half of the season he’s trying to adjust to not having that part of him, then losing all power in that relationship. Then meeting someone new who brings out different parts of his personality that I don’t think he’s expecting.ALEX KARPOVSKY Some time has elapsed, maybe a month, in these characters’ lives. And in that month Shoshanna and Ray get close. Maybe not initially. Maybe there’s a hiccup, but ultimately they do spend a considerable amount of time together. And it was really fun to explore kind of a softer, more sensitive, caring side of Ray, because we haven’t seen too much of that, especially in a romantic context.CHRISTOPHER ABBOTT [Charlie’s] smart, but because of the long relationship that he was in, you know, someone’s view can get kind of tunnel vision, when you like this one person so much, you don’t see much else. I feel like in the first season his view of the world is quite small. So his world opens up a little bit more in Season 2.Q. When you auditioned, how was the character described?KARPOVSKY There was never an audition. [Ms. Dunham] just asked me if I wanted to do the pilot. Maybe I shouldn’t say this, but the character’s name was originally Karpovsky, and I think because of that she maybe didn’t need to describe him at all. I just tried to do what she wrote. The only note that I had is: Could we change his name?ABBOTT The way Lena writes is, it all comes from real-life situations. So she gave me a bit of back story on who the character is. She told me some stories about what this guy did in this situation, and that would feed so much of who that person is. DRIVER Like, “handsome carpenter.” I remember thinking that’s why I wouldn’t get the part. Let me e-mail someone and see. [He sends e-mail to his agent and reads it.] “A carpenter, incredibly handsome, but slightly off, with whom Hannah has been sleeping with for several months. ‘He is way higher than me on the attractiveness scale,’ says Hannah. ‘Seriously, lying next to him, I feel like a kewpie doll with pubic hair.’ An avid reader, which is one of his main selling points, since he’s radically insensitive. A sexual deviant; a mysterious weirdo.”I came up with my own ideas, my own back story. I’m not going to say [what it is], no way. I’m trying to hold on to that.Even in our first conversations about that character, I’ll just try things, and I’ll just trust that Lena and Jenni will edit. They’ve kind of given me a lot of liberty to get it wrong for a long time.Q. How often are you recognized or mistaken for your character?KARPOVSKY Sometimes at a party there’ll be a semi-angry drunk, and they’ll want to have, like, a tête-à-tête with Ray, have a witty face-off with him, which is annoying. And they’re frustrated when I don’t want to play the game. But that doesn’t happen very often. DRIVER Well, a lot. Actually, since it’s been the winter, I wear a stocking cap, I feel like I cover my ears more, so people don’t say anything. As soon as the ears come out, people are like, “Oh, that guy.” Usually a lot of guys want to talk about when I [urinated] on Lena in the shower. They’re like, “I totally empathize with that.” They’re with their girlfriend, and she’s like, “Mijo, shut up.” Most guys want to talk more than I feel like women do about the show.Q. How has life changed since the show?DRIVER I could actually probably talk for hours on that in a really boring way. I originally passed on “Girls” because I thought TV was evil. I was doing a play. But [his agent persevered], and then I read it and met with Lena.I know so many good actors who haven’t had the opportunity that I’m getting now. So I’ve been finding it tricky to not lose perspective on what it is I’m doing in the first place. How do you take what you do as seriously as possible but not so seriously that it ends up inhibiting what you do? It’s all very new to me.KARPOVSKY People come up to you or you can just tell that they notice you on the subway, they give you a double take. That’s the change. Oh, and I did have roommates before the show, and now I have the luxury of not having roommates, which is really nice.Q. Were you struggling before the show?KARPOVSKY All of Season 1 I was living in my parents’ house. I would come here on the Amtrak, crash with some friends and then go back. ABBOTT I’ve never had a full-time job in the city. I did odd jobs. I had a friend who was a carpenter, so I would help him sometimes.DRIVER When I first moved to the city, I was a busboy. I graduated to waiter at a restaurant that’s not there anymore. One of the people that came in, who I served asparagus to, was Tony Kushner [the screenwriter of “Lincoln”].Q. What do you get from your side projects?DRIVER Just the service aspect of running a nonprofit is so gratifying because it takes the attention off yourself. I’m not an acting monk or anything. I’m not, like, the most well-adjusted actor. But it’s really designed to focus on yourself, or it can be. So it’s good to have something else to focus on that reminds you that it’s not always about you. Something I learned in the Marine Corps that I’ve applied to acting is, one, taking direction, and then working with a group of people to accomplish a mission and knowing your role within that team. Q. Do you watch the show?DRIVER I haven’t seen it. Because I can’t help but see mistakes and play them over and over in my head for months until I exhaust all the people around me with my neurosis. Plus, I think I would also have the impulse to try to make it better looking. I mean, I know what it feels like on the inside. I’m not so interested in seeing what it looks like on the outside.Q. Do your loved ones watch the show?ABBOTT My mom has gone to her friend’s house to watch it. My sister has seen it. They think it’s cool. The world of television and entertainment was not too relevant in my household. KARPOVSKY My parents are immigrants. My mom doesn’t speak a word of English. I just don’t think they understand anything that I do. So, when they watch the show, it’s just sort of like a fuzzy bright object swimming across the plasma screen. “When are you going to meet a nice Jewish girl?” That’s what they talk about.DRIVER My girlfriend watches it. My parents just found out about it. About a month ago they were like, “We hear you’re on a show called ‘Girls.’ ” In one way it was comforting because I’m like, “Oh, they know how to use the Internet.” But in the other way I’m like, “Just skip this one.” So they’re very excited to see “Lincoln.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/arts/television/cougar-town-and-community-with-new-leaders.html,"CULVER CITY, Calif.SINCE he became the show runner of “Cougar Town” last spring, Ric Swartzlander does not often use his personal office at that comedy’s bungalow headquarters here, preferring to work alongside his colleagues in a shared writers’ room.A visit to Mr. Swartzlander’s office in the fall suggested reasons he avoids it: its thin walls do not suppress the sounds of laughter (or singing) from other rooms; it is a frequently traveled path to a bathroom; and it is sparsely decorated, with few adornments other than a jar of pens and pencils left over from a previous regime.“I ought to get rid of it,” Mr. Swartzlander said. “At the very least send the glass off to be washed.”Yet for Mr. Swartzlander these inconveniences are more than fair trade for the top creative post at “Cougar Town,” which on Tuesday began its fourth season, after moving from ABC to uncertain basic-cable turf on TBS.And while he arrives with the endorsement of the show’s creators, Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel, Mr. Swartzlander’s ideal situation at “Cougar Town,” an ensemble comedy about a divorcée (Courteney Cox) and her wine-sipping friends, is one in which no one notices his predecessors have left.“I don’t care if anybody ever knows my name,” said Mr. Swartzlander, whose credits include unlamented comedies like “Samantha Who?” and “Man Up.” “Honestly the thing that worries me is whether or not anybody knows the difference — that it’s as consistent as the show has always been.”These same circumstances are being repeated at several established series across the broadcast and cable networks, where their show runners — the people in charge of hiring, firing, budgeting, overseeing the writing and making the significant creative decisions — are leaving, sometimes by choice and sometimes not.To their successors they bequeath popular programs with spelled-out rules, characters and formats — and often the understanding that their shows should continue to operate as if no change in leadership had occurred.The incoming show runners accept such seemingly restrictive conditions, usually hoping that the success of their inherited series rubs off on their own résumés.But these days new show runners face more scrutiny and pressure than ever, from savvy audiences that have become increasingly connected to the creators and producers of their favorite shows and who interpret these behind-the-scenes transitions as omens of doom.“The reality of what we’ve stepped into we could not be prepared for,” said Moses Port, who took over as a show runner of the NBC comedy “Community” with his writing partner, David Guarascio, in May. “The rabid fans, you don’t know how rabid they are until you step into it.”Mr. Guarascio and Mr. Port, who have written, produced and consulted on shows like “Happy Endings” and “Mad About You,” were vilified by part of the “Community” fan base when they took over from that comedy’s creator, Dan Harmon.(Writing on his blog after he was let go by Sony Pictures Television, the studio that produces “Community,” Mr. Harmon said, “I’m not saying you can’t make a good version of ‘Community’ without me, but I am definitely saying that you can’t make my version of it unless I have the option of saying ‘it has to be like this or I quit’ roughly eight times a day.”)Mr. Guarascio said he and Mr. Port faced “massive hesitation” about replacing Mr. Harmon at “Community,” about a group of misfit students at a community college and a show that has built a loyal following but struggled in the ratings over its first three seasons.On the one hand, Mr. Guarascio said, the “hard part” of the show was done: “Dan really set down the rules for this universe, and everyone else has put their blood, sweat and tears into the show,” he said. On the other hand, the show’s devotees “are very protective,” he said, “and you want to do right by them.”“It’s like, ‘Who are these new guys coming in?’ ” Mr. Guarascio said. “Wait, we’re the new guys.”“Community” may be the most notorious case this season of a series changing show runners midstream, but it is hardly the only example. When “Smash,” the NBC comedy-drama about the making of a Broadway musical, returns in February, it will have replaced its creator, Theresa Rebeck, with Joshua Safran, a former producer of “Gossip Girl.” He is adding several characters, excising others and introducing new plotlines.The NBC comedy “Whitney” changed show runners between its first and second seasons, and a similar switch is happening at that network’s “Up All Night,” whose creator is leaving, and which is moving from a single-camera to a multicamera format and adding a live audience.Elsewhere the cable channel AMC has announced a change in show runners for a coming third season of its historical drama “Hell on Wheels.” And when it ordered a fourth season of its hit zombie-apocalypse thriller, “The Walking Dead,” in December, AMC said it was parting ways with the show runner Glen Mazzara, who had taken over from the original show runner, Frank Darabont. (AMC said the network and Mr. Mazzara had “a difference of opinion about where the show should go moving forward”; Mr. Mazzara said simply that he had “told the stories I wanted to tell and connected with our fans on a level that I never imagined.”)Ken Levine, who, with his writing partner, David Isaacs, was a head writer on “M*A*S*H” and a creator and show runner of several other comedies, said these kinds of transitions were not unusual in television, and not necessarily bad signs for the health of a show.Mr. Levine said that show runners leave because they want to pursue other projects, or they become burned out by the demanding job.Citing a line he attributed to the “Happy Days” creator Garry Marshall, Mr. Levine said: “What good is all the money? You can’t spend it at Cedars” — that is, the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.What has changed over the years, Mr. Levine said, is that television viewers have become increasingly knowledgeable about the creators and producers of their favorite shows, from Steven Bochco (who helped create “Hill Street Blues,” “L.A. Law” and “NYPD Blue”) to David Chase (at HBO’s “Sopranos”) to Matthew Weiner (at AMC’s “Mad Men”).In some cases a show runner is inseparable from the voice of a series. But given the huge costs needed to get a series off the ground and keep it afloat, the people backing it have compelling reasons to keep it going, even in the absence of these signature talents.Mr. Levine said: “A network would say: ‘Yeah, even if the quality goes down, we have an investment. The show won’t be as good, but that’s not our big concern.’ ”At the same time journeyman show runners can be valuable players at series they did not create. “Networks and studios can ill afford to have a show implode because the show runner isn’t organized, because the scripts aren’t ready, because the budgets are unrealistic,” Mr. Levine said. “If you get a reputation as being a good, professional show runner who can deliver the show on time, on budget, then you’re certainly a sought-after commodity.”At “Community” Mr. Port and Mr. Guarascio were eager to prove they could maintain that show’s idiosyncratic spirit, though they stopped short of agreeing that theirs was essentially a caretaker role.“Our mission is to keep the show what it was,” Mr. Guarascio said. “If that’s caretaking, then the answer is yes.” (In the weeks since Mr. Guarascio uttered those words the season premiere of “Community” was delayed to Feb. 7 from Oct. 19, and Chevy Chase left the series.)As he moves on from “Cougar Town,” Mr. Lawrence, who also helped create shows like “Spin City” and “Scrubs,” said he saw Mr. Swartzlander as someone who was hungry and ambitious and not “necessarily a person that can cruise in and run a thousand other shows and, good or bad, just goes home at the end of the day.”“The upside,” Mr. Lawrence said, “is that if Ric turns in a creatively respected show, and TBS likes working with him, it is going to catapult his career forward.”Before he was offered the job of “Cougar Town” show runner, Mr. Swartzlander said, he had seen only a few episodes of the series. He was divorcing his wife and helping to raise their teenage daughters and not necessarily interested in the demands of being in charge of a series.But after catching up with “Cougar Town” in weekend-long cram sessions, he said, he was ready to put his nose back to the grindstone and help execute other people’s creative visions.“I know what my job is supposed to be, which is delivering Bill and Courteney and TBS what they want,” Mr. Swartzlander said. With a laugh, he added, “Going through a divorce, it’s really hard to hurt my feelings now.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/movies/social-movement-documentaries-at-sundance.html,"THE Brooklyn documentarians Audrey Ewell and Aaron Aites were watching live online as Occupy Wall Street started its ill-fated march over the Brooklyn Bridge. It was October 2011, and “there was this crazy drama unfolding,” Ms. Ewell said. “All of a sudden everybody is being arrested — and then the guy who was filming it said his batteries were running low, and the screen went black.”Ms. Ewell turned on the television. “There was absolutely nothing,” she said. “No coverage of 740 people being arrested on the Brooklyn Bridge.” So she and Mr. Aites, who had made “Until the Light Takes Us,” about Norwegian death metal, took their cameras to Zuccotti Park in Lower Manhattan. “We’re not part of the movement, but we were interested, and there was this experimental aspect that appealed to us,” Ms. Ewell said. “What would happen if you took their sort of diffuse processes and turned them into a really goal-oriented project?”The result of that experiment, “99%: The Occupy Wall Street Collaborative Film,” will have its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival next Sunday. It is one of three films at this year’s festival, along with the Arab Spring documentary “The Square“ and the Tea Party documentary “Citizen Koch,” that are racing to catch up with rapidly evolving social movements. The level of difficulty of all three films is extraordinary. At a time when digital filmmaking makes it easier to speed the news into theaters, it’s also harder to keep pace with it. Each of these films faces the challenge of describing a diverse social movement that’s still coalescing. They don’t readily present central leaders or particularly coherent messages.“For a filmmaker it’s always a question of: What are your assets and what is the narrative approach that you want to take when you want to tell a story about something as diffuse, in a way, as a movement?” said Cara Mertes, director of the Sundance Institute Documentary Film Program, which supported all three films. “Each of these actually take different narrative strategies in order to bring you into a narrative about something that is quite disparate, quite complex.”In “The Square” Jehane Noujaim, whose credits include the Al Jazeera documentary “Control Room,” tries to makes sense of the sprawling Arab Spring movement by focusing on Egyptian activists in Tahrir Square. “Jehane actually uses Tahrir Square as a geographical location, but it’s her central character,” Ms. Mertes said. “You get to know several characters, but only in relationship to that geography.”In “Citizen Koch” the directors Carl Deal and Tia Lessin take the pulse of the Tea Party by focusing on David H. Koch and Charles G. Koch, the billionaire brothers who financed Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks. “They use a third kind of angle, a follow-the-money approach,” Ms. Mertes said.The Occupy Wall Street film is the most experimental, as Ms. Ewell and Mr. Aites tried to mirror the consensus-building, nonhierarchical democracy of that movement. The title cards announce, “The film you’re about to see was made collaboratively by more than 100 filmmakers and newcomers across the United States.” The unusual credits read, “A film founded by Audrey Ewell and Aaron Aites,” and go on to list two other directors, Lucian Read and Nina Krstic, and five co-directors: Katie Teague, Peter Leeman, Aric Gutnick, Abby Martin, and Doree Simon.“They actually tried to cut a film that resembled the process of the movement itself,” said John Cooper, director of the Sundance Film Festival.Shortly after the protesters’ clash on the Brooklyn Bridge, Ms. Ewell sent out an open call. “We started off with the basic idea that anybody was welcome, experienced filmmakers would lead the project, and we wouldn’t make propaganda,” she said over coffee in a cafe in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. The filmmakers were inundated with volunteers. A list-serv soon became unmanageable. An anarchist activist hijacked their Facebook page. “We had hundreds of e-mails every day,” Ms. Ewell said, “from people who were like, ‘I think we should start working on what bands are in the movie.’ ”“That was the most popular topic,” Mr. Aites agreed.The two were able to coordinate an outline for the documentary via e-mail before killing off the list. “We ditched the consensus process wholesale,” Ms. Ewell said, “and it actually turned into the strictest hierarchy imaginable because it was complete and utter chaos without it.”Instead they focused on reflecting the diversity of the movement. “The biggest way we thought we were mirroring the movement was actually not so much about the consensus process,” Ms. Ewell added. “It was about the idea that people from all walks of life all over the country would have a voice in the final film.”Much like the Occupy Wall Street protesters, who organized into specialized affinity groups, Ms. Ewell and Mr. Aites divided contributors into subgroups by geography and issue: economic disparity, the media, student debt, protests and home foreclosure, as represented by a single mother’s situation in Minneapolis. The process involved assignments and the arduous task of reviewing more than 18 terabytes of submitted digital video. But Ms. Ewell said the film was not crowdsourced: “When people hear that, they think it’s going to be 90 minutes of YouTube.”Much like the movement the film took shape according to who volunteered — and who disappeared. “Despite their terms that there are no leaders, there were very clear, identifiable leaders in the movement,” Ms. Ewell said. “It’s who keeps showing up. And it’s the same idea with our film.”It’s no accident that the tension between democratic access and goal-oriented expertise becomes a theme in the film itself, as people argue that Occupy Wall Street’s horizontal structure prevents it from making a greater practical impact.“They need a production manager,” Ms. Ewell said, “to get that thing whipped into shape.”Mr. Aites said, shrugging: “I don’t know. They did what they did.”Ms. Ewell replied, nodding in agreement: “I know, I know. I’m imposing other values on them — and that’s what we try not to do too much of.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/arts/television/andrew-rannells-of-girls-and-the-new-normal.html,"NOT all of the boys of “Girls” fit in with the Brooklyn crew. Andrew Rannells, a longtime New York theater actor, plays Elijah, Hannah’s gay ex-boyfriend. Mr. Rannells, 34, who lives in the East Village, also stars in “The New Normal,” the NBC sitcom about a gay couple trying to have a child via surrogate. He saw his career blossom after he appeared on Broadway in “The Book of Mormon.” These are excerpts from his conversation with Melena Ryzik.Q. You were cast in “Girls” after the executive producers Lena Dunham and Jenni Konner saw you in “Book of Mormon,” right?A. They were at opening night, and then they asked me to read for them. The part was a little different. I think he was supposed to have a beard and be a yogi, and luckily she let me take a stab at it.Q. You’re a little older than the characters. Do you think their experience is accurate to life in your 20s?A. That was my experience. Lena and Jenni and Judd [Apatow, another executive producer], they capture the flaily-ness of that time so well, which I know is not a word. It’s a word that my friends use a lot, like, “I’m feeling flaily.” The net is so wide, you’re putting it all out there. I have those moments myself, in my 30s. The fact that she’s able to write about it while she’s that age, and capture it so well, is so impressive.Q. No spoilers, but you do get a little randy in the second season. You show some skin.A. That was my first sex scene and nude scene. I took that nudity waiver as a badge of honor. I took a picture of it, I sent it to my friends. I didn’t even really read it. That’s the embarrassing part. I was so excited to sign it: “I’ll show anything!”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/tv-the-thinking-persons-entertainment-of-choice.html,"SOME of television’s most compelling shows start up again this month — and thank heaven for that. “Downton Abbey,” “The Good Wife” and “Girls” will happily draw viewers — like me — back into their characters and their plot-heavy story lines.There is a reason for our attraction to these shows other than that they simply entertain us. “Downton” and today’s other quality television series also promise a welcome escape from a muddled, technology-addled existence.By pulling us away from Twitter, texts, e-mails, pointless videos and all the other technological distractions demanding attention, “Homeland,” “Mad Men” and “Breaking Bad” provide a coherent (albeit sometimes disturbing) refuge from our fragmented lives. I, for one, find a sense of narrative order, however fleeting, from these shows.They provide relief from nonnarrative mobile messages, from different voices nattering away, all at once, on different subjects and the multiple, inconstant jobs that now fill so much of our lives.Today’s shows are qualitatively different from older, sophisticated shows like “St. Elsewhere” or “Hill Street Blues” or “thirtysomething,” all of which, though deftly written, were relatively formulaic. A “Hill Street Blues” episode inevitably ended with a slow cop car chase around the same alley that eventually brought the criminal element to justice.The conflicts presented in “thirtysomething,” one of the best shows of the late 1980s and early ’90s, were even less remarkable: in one episode, for example, the pretty boomer mom Hope Steadman struggled to find a good-enough nanny for her infant daughter. Story lines sometimes stretched beyond a single episode but, for the most part, dramas were neatly resolved in the allotted time slot. Madcap antics sometimes arose (an “L.A. Law” episode involved a member of the ensemble cast in a gorilla suit) but these were incidental to the central action.The high-octane, multilayered story lines that drive today’s best television represent one side of an opposition posed by Lev Manovich, a scholar at the City University of New York Graduate Center: narrative versus database. Database logic (that of the computer archive) tends to lack beginnings or endings, and thematic developments are not necessarily sequential. Professor Manovich has written that the database is simply a collection of individual items in which “every item has the same significance as any other.” One bit of information stands on equal footing with every other bit of information. Information is gathered, without a fixed order.IN the first years of the new century, television seemed to be looking to find a competitive niche for itself in a media world increasingly dominated by the database logic of the Web. “Lost,” “Heroes” and other shows of this era (and films like “Babel” and “Traffic”) offered what I call “hyperlink television” and “hyperlink cinema.” Their “sideways” and flashback-laden narratives involved constant cutting back and forth among disparate characters, reflective of an emerging culture of sensory as well as existential multitasking. TV shows, like the rest of the world, started to operate at a frenetic pace.Those shows made sense to Web-savvy audiences alive to the fun of skipping back and forth from one thread to the next, and to random-seeming series of nonlinear sequences directed mostly by whim, taste and mood.Smartphones have helped make our lives so multilayered and cacophonous that only super-narrative television shows like “Boardwalk Empire” can offer respite from our everyday “hyperlinked” reality. My preference for these shows over “hyperlink” shows suggests that I, along with a large segment of the American viewing public, again want to be captivated by melodrama.DVR, Netflix streaming videos, television series on iTunes and television box sets with commentaries mean we can now watch these high-charged, emotive narratives as we once read novels, in long sittings, without regard for a television network’s schedule. We may well take in whole seasons or at least several episodes at once.These marathons, hilariously mocked in the show “Portlandia,” when a couple give up their jobs and friends in order to spend a week watching every episode of the latest TV iteration of “Battlestar Galactica” back to back, may actually bespeak a shared hunger for continuing, connected conversation and community. Television shows watched in this fashion provide a kind of through-line that’s missing from most of our lives.Premium cable, with its loosened content restrictions and quality programming, has made possible a period of what the Brandeis University scholar Thomas Doherty called “Arc TV,” or “adult-minded serials” whose story lines unfold “over the life span of the series” and whose strongest kinship is to the serialized novel of the 19th century.For many among today’s intelligentsia, television serials like “Homeland,” “Breaking Bad” and “Mad Men” with their continuing fables of Alicia Florrick and Walter White, Don Draper and Carrie Mathison, occupy the cultural position of the Dickens tales that were famously doled out in monthly installments. (Except that spoilers are possible now in a way they were not in the age of Pip or Little Nell.) Narrative shows have become the entertainment of choice. And that’s because stories, not algorithms, give order to our hectic world."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/arts/music/christopher-owens-leaves-girls-for-lysandre.html,"SAN FRANCISCOA FEW hours before his debut show as a solo artist, the musician Christopher Owens was nervous — “good nervous,” he clarified — and so he headed to the spot that is his regular escape: “The park,” he said, “by my house.”Mr. Owens knows Golden Gate Park intimately; he spends hours there nearly every day, walking the few blocks from his apartment in the Panhandle neighborhood here, with a pack of Marlboro menthols in his pocket.“This is a cool little place,” he said, entering the secluded AIDS Memorial Grove, financed by survivors. “It’s one of the nicest little groves in the whole park,” he said, giving a tour, “very manicured and small. I like the gardening.”Onward he continued in a brisk stride that, he said, helps him think through his songwriting, past a lawn bowling court. (He’s thinking of joining the players’ league.) At a bench on Nancy Pelosi Drive, in a chilly spot near an amphitheater where concerts are held, he sat, lighted up and was ready to talk. Cults, drug use, sexual experimentation, millionaire benefactors: Mr. Owens has no shortage of rock ‘n’ roll subjects.He is best known as the frontman and songwriter of Girls, a lo-fi band of shifting pop harmonies that arrived on the indie scene around 2007 and, with two albums and one EP, quickly became a critical darling. Songs that married a vulnerable earnestness — “Oh, I wish I had a boyfriend,” Mr. Owens sings in “Lust for Life,” over playful guitar strums; “I wish I had a father, maybe then I would’ve turned out right” — with a louche house-party vibe earned the act a devoted fan base. But in July, Mr. Owens announced on his Twitter account that he was leaving the group, which he formed with the producer and bassist J R White, to pursue a solo career. “I need to do this in order to progress,” he wrote.His debut CD as Christopher Owens, “Lysandre,” a themed album charting the course of Girls’ first tour and a love affair with a Frenchwoman named Lysandre, is due on Tuesday from Fat Possum Records. It is at once a departure from his previous work — the first track, “Lysandre’s Theme,” is 40 seconds of Renaissance-sounding melody, complete with flutes and classical guitar, that is folded into every subsequent song — and of a piece with Girls. There’s romantic longing, veiled bad behavior and naked self-doubt, set to pleasingly throwback California pop-rock (with flute and saxophone). Composing the theme not long after he returned from the tour, Mr. Owens did all the instrumentation himself — whistling the flute parts in his demos — and in a feverish rush wrote nearly all the songs in one day, a year later.“I want to be somebody who writes about his life, at his own pace and who can decide to make an album like this when he wants to,” he said. He is 33, but dressed in an oversize cardigan and a San Francisco Giants cap, appeared far more boyish. With his tousled blond bob and occasionally androgynous style, he can also resemble a younger, (slightly) cleaner Kurt Cobain, a likeness that the designer Hedi Slimane highlighted in “rock diary” portraits of Mr. Owens. When Mr. Slimane took over as the designer for Yves Saint Laurent last year, he used Mr. Owens as the face and voice for his introductory video. Onstage in a boxy suit and white ankle socks that night at the Lodge, a medieval-looking hall near downtown, playing his guitar while seated, Mr. Owens looked less like a slick rock star than like a kid on class picture day. The sold-out performance, with his new touring band in front of an audience for the first time to play the entirety of “Lysandre,” had formal programs — a theatrical touch courtesy of Mr. Owens’s girlfriend, Hannah Hunt, who also sings backup. They live together, in a building that Ms. Hunt’s mother owns. (She lives upstairs.) Mr. Owens has been part of the creative fabric of San Francisco for nine years, about as long as he has lived anywhere.His childhood is built for mythologizing. He was raised as a member of the Children of God cult, the 1970s sect that shunned Western medicine and education in favor of communal living and, by many accounts, abusive sexual behavior. His family shuttled around Europe and Asia. Mr. Owens had no formal schooling and little access to secular music, which left him craving American pop culture and youthful rites of passage.“People talk about ‘Clueless’ the movie as their high school bible or something, and I just have no idea,” he said. “I wish I knew. Basically, show me any American movie about the high school experience, and I become extremely jealous and sad that I didn’t have that.”His musical education was shaped by cult rituals, and by the tastes of members who occasionally slipped outside their world. “It was called fellowship, and we’d do it every day,” he said. “We’d sing our Christian songs for that, but then some adult would show you how to play ‘Stairway to Heaven’ or something.” Hungry for more, he recorded pop songs off the radio and studied them. “It just sounded so good. Our music was all very acoustic guitars and tambourines.”The encore to his set at the Lodge — and to his next show, in New York — which earned him a standing ovation, included the first song he ever learned, Cat Stevens’s “Wild World,” and covers of others that he played as a teenager, like the Simon and Garfunkel anthem “The Boxer.”Conflating singing with religion had a profound effect. “I of course hated all that for several years, but I know now that it gave me an ability to treat music in a different way, as a meditative thing, or an escape or to sort of take you to a different place inside,” he said.At 16, with money he earned busking, Mr. Owens left the cult and moved to Amarillo, Tex., where an older sister lived. He worked in a grocery store and fell in with the punk scene, covering himself with tattoos, which he now scrupulously hides. He experimented with drugs, first marijuana and then harder stuff.“I think you can only be a pothead for about 10 years, and then it gets really boring,” he explained. Oxycontin pills hooked him. “I’m right now not taking it,” he said, in part because he feared being caught with it on tour. “There’s just no halfway with it for me. I like it so much that if I do take it, it becomes an everyday thing. “Of his unconventional coming of age, he said: “People are almost envious of it, in a way, but it hasn’t been fun. If I had a chance now I would have picked to have some other type of life.”In Amarillo, Mr. Owens also met Stanley Marsh 3, an eccentric oil millionaire with a penchant for art installations, like the buried cars of Cadillac Ranch, and for employing young men. Mr. Owens became his personal assistant and calls Mr. Marsh a best friend and a father figure.“He was definitely the first person to ever really care about me and to give me support,” Mr. Owens said. “He single-handedly turned my life around, just by encouraging me to read books or being creative instead of being mad about the world.”Last fall Mr. Marsh and several relatives were named in multiple civil lawsuits claiming that he is a “serial abuser” of teenage boys, providing them with money, alcohol and cars in exchange for sexual favors, an allegation that Mr. Marsh denies. In November a prosecutor charged him in the sexual assault of children, cases he also intends to fight.Mr. Owens, who began working for Mr. Marsh at 21, said the lawsuits were “very disturbing to me to hear about,” adding, “I don’t know any of the details, I don’t know anybody involved, so it’s a big mystery to me.” Their relationship, he said, was platonic.Mr. Marsh, who is 74 and suffered a series of strokes two years ago, was in no shape to speak with a reporter, said Kelly Utsinger, his lawyer in Amarillo. But Mr. Owens said he still talked with him regularly, visiting before releasing “Lysandre” and drawing inspiration from him.“One time I told him I was a survivor,” Mr. Owens said, “and he told me never to say that. He told me I was an achiever.”At 25, he packed up his Volvo station wagon and moved to San Francisco by himself. He knew no one there but planned to be a painter. Instead he again fell in with a punkish music crew, including the singer Ariel Pink. He joined several bands before Girls stuck. Its debut, “Album,” in 2009, earned a best-of mention on Pitchfork. “Father, Son, Holy Ghost,” in 2011, showed he’d grown.“There’s an exquisite melancholy to his singing now, approaching Robert Smith territory,” Jon Caramanica wrote in a review in The New York Times. “And as much as anyone in indie rock, he excels at that Cobain thing of putting anguish front and center while never truly allowing full access to it.”But “Father, Son,” which turned out to be the last Girls album, was “not an easy record to make,” said Doug Boehm, who produced it and “Lysandre.” “Nobody knew their parts.”The breakup of Girls drove fervent speculation in the indie world. Mr. Owens said it was simply the result of growing pains and shifting lineups. “Nobody hated each other or anything like that,” but success “happened a little too fast,” he said. “The band would have survived longer if we would have gone slower.”(Mr. White, the co-founder of Girls, did not reply to requests for comment.)With “Lysandre” Mr. Owens tells the story of Girls as he experienced it, from his gritty start — hustling, guns, “sleeping in the back of a pickup truck,” as he sings on “New York City” — to touring the south of France. Along the way there was a breakup with a boy and a long-distance romance with the Frenchwoman. Mr. Owens said he was “very attracted to women” and didn’t seek out relationships with men, but they happened.In Ms. Hunt, an ethereal blonde with a wry sense of humor, who is pursuing a graduate degree in landscape architecture at the University of California, Berkeley, he has found stability, he said.“You will love me for all the reasons everyone hates me,” he sings in “Honey Bunny,” a 2011 Girls song that features Ms. Hunt in the video. “I need a woman who loves me, me, me, me, me, me.”Mr. Boehm, who’s recorded K. D. Lang and Elliott Smith, said, “He’s probably the most honest songwriter I’ve ever worked with.” He added, “I think he’s way more normal than most people imagine.”Mr. Owens still thinks of himself as set apart. “If ever a discussion about the Bible comes up, my vast knowledge of it can become very reassuring to me that I’m just not normal still,” he said. But his creative drive keeps him forward focused. Despite his confessional style, he has never written about his childhood.“If I chose not to tell people, people would never know,” he said. “It’s not that big of a deal. Sometimes I feel like a European or something.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/arts/music/yannick-nezet-seguin-is-at-the-top-of-the-orchestra-game.html,"MontrealTAKING Bruckner to the people last month, the compact maestro arrived at a cultural center on the blue-collar outskirts of this city. The hall had the ambience of a glorified high school auditorium, with dust-dry acoustics and concrete walls. But the 400 seats were packed with families and couples and groups of retirement-age friends.That maestro, Yannick Nézet-Séguin, picked up a microphone and spoke to audience members, seamlessly switching from French to English, and reassured them about all the empty chairs onstage for the Bach suite opening the program. For Bruckner, he promised, “you will see all the chairs filled.”So they did. And the standing ovation was immediate for shapely performances of Bach’s Orchestral Suite No. 2 and Bruckner’s Symphony No. 6.The listeners were clearly delighting in the presence of Mr. Nézet-Séguin, their native son, at the helm of the ensemble he had led for 12 years, the Orchestre Métropolitain of Montreal.The circumstances in December were a far holler from what Mr. Nézet-Séguin will experience on Thursday evening. The stage then will be Carnegie Hall and the musicians members of the storied Philadelphia Orchestra, which he took over as music director in the fall, after one of the roughest patches since its founding in 1900.Mr. Nézet-Séguin (pronounced nay-ZAY say-GHEN) has reached the top of the orchestra game. In addition to Philadelphia, he is music director of the Rotterdam Philharmonic in the Netherlands and principal guest conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra.Major orchestras around the world book him as a guest. Equally at home in the pit, he has a long-term relationship with the Metropolitan Opera, where he has been talked about as a credible successor to James Levine as music director.When asked about such speculation, Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he could see himself as the music director of a major opera house someday.“It’s too early now,” he added. “I’m only 37. It’s been going so wonderfully, I need to live for the moment.” Mr. Nézet-Séguin is what the orchestra world is desperate for: a young, charismatic maestro who can win the respect, even affection, of grizzled orchestra veterans, the enthusiasm of audiences and the praise of critics, which has for him been pretty exalted.Partial to skinny jeans and tight V-neck sweaters, with a turtle tattoo on his right shoulder acquired while on vacation in Tahiti, Mr. Nézet-Séguin has the technical wherewithal and the musical knowledge of an established maestro. He also commands an almost supernatural amount of energy — the kind that drives him to turn score pages with a crack, the kind that keeps him ebullient even after long hours of rehearsal, picture-taking sessions, interviews and meetings with music industry operatives.He made a rousing Carnegie debut with the Philadelphians in October. The next day he was back in Philadelphia, rehearsing, offering suggestions to the composer of a work awaiting its premiere, doing detailed work on Brahms’s Symphony No. 4. He was bouncing off his stool.“I should be glued to that thing,” he said.Mr. Nézet-Séguin sometimes seems not so much to conduct as to mold his gestures to the flow of the music. His motions are large, extending from his upper torso. Often his shoulders seem hunched, like those of a cougar waiting to pounce. At 5-foot-5 he has a powerful upper body from working out. (Mighty Mouse, the soprano Joyce DiDonato called him.)He is deft and sure in leading large forces and has a keen sense of climaxes and endings, making them seem inevitable yet often gripping. He draws an uncommon sweep and suppleness from orchestras. He also works well with singers.“He’s able to walk the line between accommodating the singer and keeping his vision as the conductor of the piece,” said Ms. DiDonato, who sang Donna Elvira in a recent recording of Mozart’s “Don Giovanni” conducted by Mr. Nézet-Séguin for Deutsche Grammophon. “He brought confidence and reassurance.”It seems a dizzying rise for a former boy chorister who made his European conducting debut only in 2004 and his New York debut at Mostly Mozart in 2009.But before he came to international attention, Mr. Nézet-Séguin served a fruitful apprenticeship in Canada, conducting in places like Winnipeg, Manitoba; Kitchener, Ontario; and Victoria, British Columbia. Above all he was molded by an extraordinarily fertile classical music world in his native province, Quebec. Time spent with him, his family and his friends in Montreal, where he lives, made clear the powerful influence of his roots and his long tie with the Orchestre Métropolitain, founded in 1981 for the sake of Québécois musicians. It is with that orchestra that he “puts on his slippers,” in the words of Lise Beauchamp, the orchestra’s principal oboist for 20 years. “Here we are like family,” she said.Mr. Nézet-Séguin knows many of its members from their time at the conservatory together. His companion of 16 years, Pierre Tourville, is the assistant principal violist. One of his oldest and closest friends, Jennifer Bourdages, is the orchestra’s pianist.It was also with the Orchestre Métropolitain that he plowed through the heart of the symphonic repertory: Mahler, Beethoven, Bruckner. By 26 he had conducted mammoth staples like Mahler’s Symphony No. 2 and Verdi’s Requiem. He and the orchestra have made 13 recordings.Mr. Nézet-Séguin is repeatedly asked, now that his career is on an international level, whether he will move. He always says no. “Do you want me to leave?” he once erupted when the orchestra’s board asked him the same question.Quebec’s unusually rich classical music culture results partly from generous government spending on the arts and a strong Roman Catholic tradition that creates a heavy demand for church choirs and organists. The province, home to eight million people, has 12 orchestras, 7 conservatories (in addition to university music programs) and high classical music recording sales.“We claim a lot here in Quebec that we are close to Europe and the French spirit,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said. At the same time Quebecers are free of “this burden of generations of history,” he added. Two cultures and two languages create an “effervescence” as well as an “underlying energy that you always have to prove yourself, to make sure that you exist.”“That’s very productive and very creative,” he said.Mr. Nézet-Séguin is part of a small wave of Québécois conductors on the international scene, including Bernard Labadie, founder of Les Violons du Roy in Quebec City; Jacques Lacombe, music director of the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra; and Jean-Marie Zeitouni, music director of the Columbus Symphony in Ohio.“We are definitely currently in a golden era,” André Gremillet, managing director of the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra in Australia, said in an e-mail. Himself a Quebec native, Mr. Gremillet, while president and chief executive of the New Jersey Symphony, hired Mr. Lacombe as music director, starting in 2010.It may seem odd that Quebec’s best-known conductor does not conduct Quebec’s top ensemble and one of Canada’s finest, the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. Rivalry with the Orchestre Métropolitain may be the reason. Mr. Nézet-Séguin made guest appearances early in his career, he said, but the last invitation came in 2004. He declined because of what he called a condescending tone.“It’s not as if I need it,” he said, departing from his usual sense of diplomacy.Madeleine Careau, the Montreal Symphony’s chief executive, said the orchestra invited him every year but, after repeated rejections, simply gave up. “Maybe he doesn’t want to conduct another Montreal orchestra,” she said. “We would love to have him.”Returning to Montreal to work with the Orchestre Métropolitain remains a significant part of Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s life. In December he conducted each of two programs — the Bach-Bruckner pairing and Mahler’s Symphony No. 4 with a Bach cantata — at the Maison Symphonique and out in a neighborhood.Mr. Nézet-Séguin was born the third of three children in 1975 in Montreal. His parents were university educators. He began piano lessons at 5, quickly absorbing repertory, and at 9 he joined the prominent Choeur Polyphonique de Montréal.At 10 he announced his desire to conduct. “His playmates would pretend to play violin with a tree branch, and he would pretend to conduct with a stick,” said his mother, Claudine Nézet, now his personal assistant.At 12 he started formal music studies at the Quebec Conservatory. He began leading the choir in rehearsals a year later and became its conductor at 18, as well as founding his own orchestra and choir, La Chapelle de Montréal.Around then he wrote to his hero. As a boy Yannick haunted record stores and used his earnings as a church singer to vacuum up CDs. Having randomly picked up Brahms’s Symphony No. 1, conducted by Carlo Maria Giulini, he was smitten and bought many Giulini recordings.“It was the clarity” of the music making, he said. “I felt I was hearing the score. Everything was in the right place. It transformed eventually my understanding of the spirituality of it or the humanity of it.”Twice Mr. Nézet-Séguin wrote Giulini, a revered Italian maestro with the air of a musical high priest, asking to meet him. Finally, while in Trieste in the summer of 1997 for a four-hand piano competition, Mr. Nézet-Séguin was summoned to Milan for an audience with the maestro.The two met a half-dozen times during Giulini’s last year of conducting. Mr. Nézet-Séguin traveled to sit in on rehearsals, attend concerts and go over scores with his mentor. Giulini never saw him conduct nor gave him an actual lesson in stick waving. But Mr. Nézet-Séguin said he learned important lessons.“He was so respectful of everyone,” he said. “He had the capacity to make me feel more confident about my own ideas, which in the end is the best lesson in conducting. Any question I would ask him would always go back to: ‘How do I feel? How would I sing it? How do you keep things simple?’ ”Mr. Nézet-Séguin counts two other individual influences: his piano teacher at the conservatory, Anisia Campos, a student of Alfred Cortot, and Joseph Flummerfelt, who runs weeklong conducting seminars in the summer at Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J. Mr. Nézet-Séguin attended two of them as a teenager.Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s first major appointment arrived in 2000, when he became music director of the Orchestre Métropolitain. The circumstances were ugly, but he seems to have sidestepped any taint. His predecessor, Joseph Rescigno, a well liked conductor from New York, had invited Mr. Nézet-Séguin as a guest conductor. Abruptly the orchestra’s chairman and a former government minister, Jean-Pierre Goyer, announced that Mr. Rescigno would be replaced by Mr. Nézet-Séguin.Mr. Rescigno later sued, saying he was forced out in violation of his contract, and won damages. In an interview Mr. Rescigno said he did not think Mr. Nézet-Séguin was aware of the machinations. Mr. Nézet-Séguin said his appointment “came as a total surprise.” (Mr. Goyer died in 2011.)Another surprise, he said, was the music directorship of the Philadelphia Orchestra, which came 18 months after his debut with the orchestra, in December 2008, conducting Tchaikovsky’s Symphony No. 6. With perfect pitch he told the Philadelphia players at their first rehearsal that he had listened to Eugene Ormandy’s recording of the work with the Philadelphians over and over. It was the kind of reference to musical tradition that he often makes.“It felt from the first moment that we had known each other in a previous life,” Mr. Nézet-Séguin said.The orchestra has been adrift, held together by the caretaker leadership of Charles Dutoit, for many years the music director of the Montreal Symphony. Philadelphia emerged from bankruptcy proceedings last year, the first major American orchestra to go that route.Mr. Nézet-Séguin said his main goal in Philadelphia was “to grab the city again, to transform the pride the city has toward its orchestra to a much more proactive pride, a real passion for it, a sense of ownership.”At that last Carnegie outing, the Verdi Requiem in October, Mr. Nézet-Séguin held his hand up for a good 20 seconds after the final chord expired before dropping his arms to his sides. He seemed stunned by the ovation.Applause from his inner circle greeted him in the crowded dressing room. Attendants broke open bottles of sparkling wine. Mr. Nézet-Séguin embraced his companion, Mr. Tourville, looked him in the eyes and said, “Oui?”“Oui,” Mr. Tourville answered.With an air of coronation, orchestra and Carnegie Hall executives toasted Mr. Nézet-Séguin.“It was my deepest wish that it would work here,” he said, “and it did.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/movies/sheldon-candis-directs-his-first-film-luv.html,"IN the film “Luv,” opening Jan. 18, an 11-year old boy learns some not-always-lovely life lessons from his paroled uncle on the streets of Baltimore. Its director, Sheldon Candis, 33, has learned a few lessons himself on the way to making his first feature, which had its premiere at last year’s Sundance Film Festival. A Baltimore native, Mr. Candis loosely based the film’s story, which he wrote with Justin Wilson, on childhood experiences with his own uncle: riding around late at night in his car and listening to his advice on how to be a man. His possible criminal connections weren’t an issue. The fictionalized version goes deeper, exploring what happens when role models exhibit less than model behavior.His lead characters, and their actors, give the film its emotional center: Uncle Vincent, played by the rapper Common, and his nephew Woody, portrayed by the up-and-comer Michael Rainey Jr., then 10. “I always say Michael is an alien,” Mr. Candis said. “He’s not from this world.”Mr. Candis received a degree from the University of Southern California School of Cinematic Arts and spent time working on film sets before meeting Mr. Wilson, his writing partner, and drafting a screenplay. Mr. Candis was able to get his film off the ground when his producer, Jason Berman, landed him a meeting with fellow Baltimore native Charles S. Dutton. It turned out that Mr. Dutton knew members of Mr. Candis’s family and became the first actor to sign onto the project. “Luv” was further developed with the help of Film Independent, which provides resources to filmmakers. During a recent interview, an upbeat Mr. Candis spoke with Mekado Murphy about managing Common and the movie’s long gestation. These are excerpts from the conversation.Q. Tell me a little about your experience with your uncle.A. I looked up to him. He was the greatest male figure in my life at the time. And while he had this infamous reputation on the streets of Baltimore, I never witnessed any of that. And many of the life lessons he had passed on to me are still with me to this day.Q. Did you find out more about him before writing the script?A. I spoke with Ed Burns, former Baltimore police detective [and David Simon’s writing partner on the television series “The Wire”]. He shared all these details with me, things I never knew. He said: “You have to understand something. Your uncle was the great manipulator. He could use anything or anyone to get what he wanted. So if you’re telling me you spent those long nights in his car, it makes me believe, if he was transporting drugs, and a police officer passed the two of you, he wouldn’t look suspicious.”Q. How do you see your film?A. For me it’s about boys searching for their fathers. One of the main themes of the film is owners versus renters. It’s not necessarily taking ownership of material things, but taking ownership of one’s life.Q. How long did the process take from development to a finished movie?A. It took us eight years: three years of writing and rewriting and another five of just trying to find the financing and get the script out to actors.Q. What were your techniques for directing Common?A. I always connected with him on a very emotional level. What I did with him, and he doesn’t know it to this day, was I took on the nature and the qualities of his younger brother looking to him for guidance. It was a psychological thing to do with him, to come to him as my elder.Q. Was it a goal to give people from minorities more opportunities in film?A. I thought, if I have an opportunity, why don’t I empower not only black people, but the minority, the less given to? Therefore I wanted to go back home to Baltimore and empower my community. That’s a part of what I want my life’s existence to be."

Jim Broadbent plays her husband, Denis, whose ghost an aged Mrs. Thatcher converses with while recalling her glory years. “Stiff-legged and slow-moving, behind a discreetly applied ton of geriatric makeup, Ms. Streep provides, once again, a technically flawless impersonation that also seems to reveal the inner essence of a well-known person,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Her portrayal of Mrs. Thatcher in power, while equally impeccable, is limited by the film’s vague and cursory treatment of her political career. ‘The Iron Lady’ is, above all, the story of a widow and a half-abandoned mother who happened — didn’t you know? — to have been one of the most powerful and consequential women of the 20th century.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/arts/music/ninth-annual-winter-jazzfest.html,"The ninth annual Winter Jazzfest reached capacity at around 7:30 on Saturday night, which meant that a lot of bands that aren’t completely hot in New York became so by the laws of supply and demand. It was right around that time that I heard the owner of the Zinc Bar, Alex Kay, use this-inbox-is-full tones to deliver the following sentence to a line of disappointed faces on West Third Street in Greenwich Village: “You will not get in to see Tigran tonight.”That’s Tigran Hamasyan, the young Armenian pianist who won the Thelonious Monk competition in 2006 and who has had much better luck in Europe than in America, signing with Universal France and living mostly in Paris. He can destroy at fast tempos and odd meters, but when I pushed in for a few songs, I heard idealistically simple melodies, some of them Eastern European, built up into miniature pop fantasias with a band including the singer Areni Agbabian as well as the saxophonist Ben Wendel and the drummer Nate Wood, both from the American band Kneebody. It was a rarefied virtuosic swoon, not really a New York thing.But a lot of people in that line might live in Europe, or scout it professionally. Winter Jazzfest, held Friday and Saturday nights for about eight hours each in seven different clubs and theaters in the Village and points east, isn’t necessarily a representation of New York, and doesn’t have to be. A lot of its attendees — about 2,500 on the second night and slightly fewer on the first — are in town for the Association of Performing Arts Presenters conference and see jazz as an international circuit. Several hundred more at Winter Jazzfest might be students, who might hear about people like Mr. Hamasyan from far away. They’d definitely know about Mr. Wendel and Mr. Wood, who played hectic, precise post-jazz later that night with Kneebody at the Culture Project Theater. (That is a space, by the way, that should be used more often for improvised music, and as soon as possible: a wide, raked-seating 200-capacity black box.)And then there are the working musicians, both playing and not. At this same festival a couple years ago I reasoned, based on observational averages around the bar at several spaces, that every sixth person in my immediate perimeter was somebody I’d written about.A 45-minute slot at Winter Jazzfest is not a high-paying gig. The event is built of new or recent projects, just about entirely, and most jazz festivals can’t support that. (Jazz audiences can take a while to recognize new things and longer to love them.) It has become a place to jump-start new projects that might not get much play in the American establishment jazz clubs, for many of the reasons that they might be interesting to hear.Foreignness, for example. Uncompromising rhythmic spikiness. (You could chart a course through the weekend and feel that it was really the odd-meter and additive-meter festival.) Instrumentational rarity — like the harpist Brandee Younger’s tribute to Dorothy Ashby; or Jacob Garchik’s multiple-trombone gospel-jazz group, the Heavens; or Colin Stetson’s urgent solo-bass-saxophone set, which looked like upright alligator wrestling and sounded, without digital looping, like three different alien transmissions at once; or the saxophonist Tony Malaby’s fabulously hard-to-define new band, which has neither bass nor piano but instead Dan Peck on tuba and the drummer John Hollenbeck turning to an electric keyboard, putting harmony backgrounds behind Mr. Malaby’s big, broad, textured sound.You saw lots of new bands convened by bassists and drummers, engine-room operators stepping up as leaders. The drummers included Nasheet Waits, in a new version of his band Equality — including the pianist Vijay Iyer, the saxophonist Logan Richardson and the bassist Mark Helias — which still has some settling to do; also Jaimeo Brown, Pedrito Martinez, Bobby Previte.But can we talk about bassists? At Sullivan Hall on Saturday, Dezron Douglas led his hard-swinging New Jazz Workshop, a band that came together about 10 years ago under the teaching of Jackie McLean at the University of Hartford and ought to be heard more in this town. It has multiple composers, including the trumpeter Josh Evans and the pianist David Bryant, and it takes the roots of hard bop — one song, Mr. Douglas explained, was inspired by Louis Hayes’s cymbal beat, heard on Cannonball Adderley records 50 years ago — but pushes them toward charismatic abstraction.Michael Formanek played a set of metrically complex music at the Culture Project Theater that felt calm and powerful. It was a different quartet from the one he’s been recording with recently for ECM, but one that understood the dimensions of its sound. And yet another bassist, Mario Pavone, played a power-trio set with the trumpeter Dave Ballou and the drummer Tyshawn Sorey: open-ended jams on short themes, driven by Mr. Pavone’s driving, vamping notes and chords and Mr. Sorey’s constantly changing strategies around the drum kit. That set was in the small rock club Bowery Electric, where the bass and kick-drum were mixed at metal strength in the house sound system.As always the festival presented a music that’s traveling in various directions at once. Its singers are moving toward pop-folk structure, bossa-nova mood and clear-water tones, like Maria Neckam, and toward blues and early jazz, like Catherine Russell. It’s loud and trend conscious and brainy, like the electric guitarist Rafiq Bhatia’s quartet, and also rustling, intuitive, unvirtuosic, unconcerned with style or genre — like a fascinating trio I heard led by yet another bass player, Eric Revis, with the pianist Kris Davis and the eminent drummer Andrew Cyrille, who seems suddenly in demand again, another turn in a 50-year career.It’s music resolutely of a time and place: now, or even New York in the 90s, as in the clarinetist Don Byron’s set, jazz as we know it, surging and deflecting, in a powerful hookup between a soloist and his rhythm section. And it’s like the alto saxophonist Rudresh Mahanthappa’s new band, Gamak, which uses the long phrasing of Indian and Indonesian music, the shred-power of electric fusion and the deep, heavy beats of funk and metal. That sounds pretty theoretical, a pretty student-y combination, but on Saturday at Le Poisson Rouge it wasn’t a hard proposition to sell. Bracing and physical, it dislodged the realest crowd roars I’d heard at an improvised music concert in a while."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/arts/music/purity-ring-at-webster-hall.html,"Gaping holes and deliberate convolutions define the songs of Purity Ring, the Canadian duo that performed at Webster Hall on Saturday night, the second of two nights. Megan James is the singer and occasional percussionist; Corin Roddick controls the electronics and keeps busy in real time with drumsticks, tapping on lanterns that light up as they trigger individual notes. Purity Ring combines programmed tracks that are overtly artificial with idiosyncratic content, creating a carnal presence in a digital environment.Their songs could have been typical electropop. Each has a tidy melody and perky synthesizer hooks atop a few basic chords, and Ms. James sings in a piping, guileless voice, which is sometimes run through a digital stuttering effect. But the lyrics are cryptic and often ominous: obsessed with the human body and the natural world, alluding to violence and mortification. “They’ll cover the hills with their sweet flesh and soft nails/They’ll cover the doors with the screams that their minds dispose,” Ms. James sweetly intoned in “Crawlersout.” (Nearly all of Purity Ring’s song titles squash words together.)And there’s a void where a dance beat would go, a hollow bordered by sporadic ratchety sounds up above and, far below, skulking bass lines and sporadic kick-drum thuds, with hazy sustained electronics in between. They’re techniques derived from genres like Southern hip-hop, drum-and-bass, minimal techno and witch house; Purity Ring uses them to create beats that are more like slow, heaving respiration than obvious propulsion. But at Webster Hall a dancing audience picked up the implications.The set was brief, only 46 minutes. It included every song on Purity Ring’s 2012 album, “Shrines,” along with a version of Soulja Boy’s “Grammy” that proved Ms. James can belt a straightforward pop chorus (and sing hip-hop rhymes). Performing mostly in darkness, with white lozenge-shaped plastic foam blobs dangling overhead, Purity Ring didn’t decode its songs or vary them appreciably from the album tracks. (As on the album Isaac Emmanuel of Young Magic — the opening act — added guest vocals on “Grandloves.”) They were the same crafty, pretty, curiously inviting enigmas, retaining their secrets even in public.Young Magic, a three-member Brooklyn band, also builds songs around programmed beats, electronic ambience and, at times, a woman’s voice — from Melati Malay — but to far different effect. Mr. Emmanuel has traveled the world collecting sounds, incorporating many of them into the band’s album, “Melt.” A video screen showed mysteriously costumed people doing mysterious things; the rhythms, decisively underlined by live drumming from Michael Italia, were dreamy processionals or allusions to kinetic trance rituals. Exoticism ruled."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/nyregion/with-transit-chairmanship-fernando-ferrer-slips-back-onstage.html,"THE answer was obvious even before the question was posed, but we felt like asking anyway. Given reports that Michael R. Bloomberg has been shopping around for someone he’d like to anoint as the next mayor, is it possible that Fernando Ferrer got a call? Mr. Ferrer smiled. It was a half-smile, one registering both amusement and bemusement.“I mean, if I were he, supposedly a fully grown adult, I’d be embarrassed by it,” he said of the Bloomberg search for a designated successor. “Leave it at that.”Fact is, he said the other day over breakfast at a Bronx diner, his last conversation with the mayor was quite a while back. Mr. Bloomberg had tried to recruit him to take part in a lighthearted video for the annual Inner Circle dinner, where reporters and politicians trade jabs. “I took a pass,” he said.So Freddy Ferrer, to use the nickname he has had since boyhood, won’t be New York’s mayor. But you knew that. Not that he hasn’t reached for the brass ring; he ran three mayoral campaigns of varying intensity. The last time out, in 2005, Mr. Bloomberg beat him soundly.That, it seemed, was that, for him and public service. He’d go off to a consulting group, sit on a few company boards, enjoy his three grandchildren, work on his tennis game, maybe reflect on his years as a city councilman and Bronx borough president. A comfortable life, one that does not require him to speculate, despite urging from his tablemate, on how the city might have been different these last years under a Mayor Ferrer.“I think you get your chance in the context of an election to make your case,” he said. “You fail to make it? Done. Accept the verdict and move on.”But life can take funny bounces. Freddy Ferrer is back.A year and a half ago, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo put him on the board of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority. Then he was made the authority’s vice chairman. Now, almost out of nowhere, he has ascended to the chairmanship, as visible a position as we have in this city. True, he is only acting chairman, until the governor finds a permanent replacement for Joseph J. Lhota, who left to contemplate a mayoral race of his own. So Mr. Ferrer, who turns 63 in April, will not stay at the top for long.“Yeah, but it’s nice to be the chair,” he said, “because you can ask questions and get quick answers. If you’d like to ask a very drill-down-deep question about service or about a project, you get a really detailed answer. And you can have some impact on policy.”His unexpected re-emergence prompted curiosity about second acts in New York public life. And that led, at his suggestion, to the Tibbett Diner, which still had its Christmas lights up, with candy canes dangling from the wires.The diner sits on Tibbett Avenue, sandwiched between a carwash and an auto repair shop along an ill-defined line that separates the Bronx neighborhoods of Spuyten Duyvil, where he lives, and Kingsbridge. The street may most politely be described as unprepossessing.“I don’t need a menu,” Mr. Ferrer said to the waitress. By now, he practically has it memorized.   “He’s a regular,” the waitress said. Indeed, he started coming here in the late 1970s with his wife, Aramina. But on this morning he didn’t mingle much with the other diners, settling into a corner booth. He ordered tomato juice, an onion-and-Swiss-cheese omelet with a side of tomatoes — hold the potatoes — buttered rye toast and coffee. Got to have coffee, Mr. Ferrer said.“Breakfast of champions,” Mr. Ferrer said when his food arrived. He ended up leaving it half-eaten, though.All right, second acts: How did this one come about? Why even bother at this stage?“Look,” — a lot of his sentences begin with “look” — “I’m very happy with my life,” he said. “Look, if in your DNA there’s a couple of public-service genes, they don’t go away. Public service was always very satisfying. If you can get some good things done and help some people, why else would you want to do this?”His path to the transportation board began with a phone call from Representative Nydia M. Velázquez, one of five leaders of the transition team for the newly elected Governor Cuomo. She asked if Mr. Ferrer wanted to join the administration.“I appreciate it, very flattering, no thanks,” he replied. “She said, ‘Well, then, how about the M.T.A. board?’ I’d been recruited by former Governor Spitzer to be on the S.U.N.Y. board of trustees, but that was the weekend before he imploded. So I was happy to see that nomination go. But the M.T.A. board was intriguing.”“Friends of mine have accused me of needing to run a small country,” he said. In its own way, that’s what the transit system is.This breakfast was not about specific transit policies. Still, it was impossible to resist asking if he had any pet peeves as a regular on the No. 1 subway line and on Metro-North. Naturally, he did. Is he not a New Yorker? His complaints tended, however, to be about other riders, not transit managers. Like this one: “People who eat full-blown meals on the subway — that drives me up the wall. I can’t stand it. Hey, look, a muffin, a candy bar, a cup of coffee? I get that. A meal with noodles? I’m sorry.” Fair enough.“You didn’t ask me what I like,” he said later, in a mild rebuke. All right, we’ll bite. “It’s affordable,” he said. “It’s safe. It’s clean — mostly. And it’s reliable.” Some would give him an argument on those points but, again, this meal was not about policy.Let’s talk instead about facial hair. For years, Mr. Ferrer had a mustache, a feature that made him instantly recognizable. Then he shaved it. Now he has a full beard, which we have to say looks an awful lot like Mr. Lhota’s. “I saw Joe last week,” Mr. Ferrer said, “and he said, ‘What, every M.T.A. chairman has to have a beard now?’ I said, ‘No, I’m hiding out. People will think I’m you.’  ”If he has a regret, it is that this new position came about only a few weeks after the death of his mother, Susan. “She’d have gotten a kick out of seeing this M.T.A. thing,” he said.He grew up in the South Bronx, reared by his mother and his grandmother, Inocencia. When he was running for mayor, he used to talk about his roots, and how his grandmother had toiled in the kitchen of the Waldorf-Astoria hotel.The evening before this breakfast, he happened to be at the Waldorf, for an Andrew Cuomo birthday party cum fund-raiser. It brought him back to when he was a grand marshal in the Puerto Rican Day parade, in 1993, a year before his grandmother died.“I’m really glad she lived to see that,” he said. “The grand marshal’s breakfast was always at the Marriott. I changed it that year to the Starlight Roof of the Waldorf, and then I let people know that morning why.” That one was for Inocencia."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/football/russell-wilson-of-seahawks-shows-talent-and-poise-in-loss.html,"ATLANTA — In the morgue silence of the Seattle locker room, several Seahawks sat frozen on folding chairs, staring straight ahead at nothing. A few heads were hidden beneath white towels. One player sniffled.The rookie quarterback, in stark contrast, casually slipped into a patterned, conservative three-piece suit as if dressing for a day in the corner office. Russell Wilson’s demeanor belied the fact that he had just engineered a comeback of the highest drama, only to have it trumped by Atlanta’s beat-the-clock field goal in a 30-28 Falcons playoff victory Sunday.“Obviously, very disappointing,” Wilson said. “We had high, high hopes for the rest of the season.” But the gloom was fleeting. As he walked off the Georgia Dome field and into the tunnel afterward, Wilson gushed to the quarterbacks coach Carl Smith how excited he already was about his sophomore season.In the huddle, Wilson’s mantra is to move on to the next play. Evidently, he lives it, too.“The greatest thing about it is, we get to look forward to the next opportunity,” he said.Anyone tuning into Sunday’s game after swearing off the N.F.L. since the draft last April might have thought he was viewing a piece of fiction. Wilson was the 75th choice — 74 behind Andrew Luck and 73 after Robert Griffin III, quarterbacks who entered the league with far more acclaim — and height.Third-round selections are not supposed to start immediately at the increasingly complex position, much less advance their teams into title contention. Yet Seattle had won six straight games, averaging 33 points, while becoming a fashionable pick to surface in the Super Bowl.An analysis of the first half Sunday, after which the Seahawks trailed by 20-0, would not have revealed rookie jitters as the chief cause of Seattle’s situation. Tailback Marshawn Lynch’s lost fumble in Falcons territory poisoned one drive. Two others just before the break were capsized in the red zone by a pair of failed runs in short-yardage situations — neither, oddly, involving Lynch, who had exceeded 100 rushing yards in five straight games — and a coaching faux pas when the Seahawks neglected to save a timeout in case of a quarterback sack.When Wilson was dumped at the Atlanta 20 with about 12 seconds remaining, he could not reset the offense in time for another snap. For Seattle, the half could not have expired more frustratingly.“I still knew we were going to win,” Wilson said. “At least, that’s what I thought.”The sentiment was widely shared, especially by two frequent Wilson targets: wide receiver Golden Tate and tight end Zach Miller, who each scored a touchdown and exceeded 100 receiving yards.“At no point did we think the game was over with,” Tate said.Miller added, “For being down what we were, we were pretty positive at halftime.”When the game resumed, Miller said, the voice in charge of the huddle kept emphasizing the one-play-at-a-time approach.“Just focus on the next one,” Miller said. Once momentum was mustered, Miller added, “I felt like nothing could stop us.”In the final two quarters, Wilson connected on 14 for 19 passes for 241 yards while splicing in 34 more yards on five scrambles. The scoring marches covered 80, 80, 62 and 61 yards, not a single one offering Seattle’s offense a shortcut after a turnover or lengthy kick return.“I love it when the game is on the line,” Wilson said, “when everyone else is nervous and I’m excited.”Upon Lynch’s 2-yard score that lifted Seattle ahead, 28-27, only 31 seconds separated Wilson from an N.F.C. Championship game, well after Luck and Griffin had closed shop for the season.Amid the disappointment of defeat, Seahawks Coach Pete Carroll rolled out the superlatives for Wilson, calling him incredible and amazing, just for starters.“It is unheard-of for rookies to do stuff like that, but he ain’t a rookie,” Carroll said. “He is just good.”As Wilson’s more distraught teammates were breaking out of their catatonic state and coming out from under the towels, he was displaying little emotion for the news media.“To start as a rookie, to grow so much, to play at a high level was great for me,” he said.From Wilson, who finished with 385 passing yards, the words rang modestly sincere, conveyed in such a tone that no Seahawks player would take offense.He was businesslike all the while, except for a moment by his locker. When someone found his wedding ring on the floor and handed it over, Wilson sighed with relief and thanked him.Today marks his one-year anniversary. For the workaholic who is loath to take a day off, Wilson alluded to a blessing from the loss: he and wife, Ashton, finally can go on a honeymoon."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/arts/television/real-violence-puts-pressure-on-tv-fiction.html,"LOS ANGELES — When Kevin Reilly, the chairman for entertainment at the Fox network, commissioned an ambitious thriller series called “The Following,” about a Hannibal Lecter-like serial killer who inspires a legion of deranged followers, his intention was to challenge the cable business, not the culture.Now, in the wake of the horrific shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Conn., Mr. Reilly knows he cannot avoid questions about the propriety of putting that kind of content on television in an atmosphere of heightened sensitivity about violence.“The timing is not great,” Mr. Reilly said in an interview here during the semiannual press tour where networks discuss new programs. “The show does not deserve to be the poster child for our society.”But if the persistent questioning of Mr. Reilly and other executives by reporters who cover the television business is any indication, the issue of extreme violence on screen and its potential impact has become a thicket programmers cannot avoid.“I don’t think there’s anyone on this planet whose life hasn’t been changed and/or affected by the recent course of events,” said Nina Tassler, the president of CBS Entertainment. But, she argued, “nothing that is on the air is inappropriate.”CBS has more programming involving murders than any other network, but, Ms. Tassler said, the network justifies the level of carnage by assuring that “the bad guys are brought to justice.” In response to criticism of a specific CBS show, “Criminal Minds,” which features a serial killer every week, she said she would not allow her 14-year-old child to watch that show because “it’s an adult show.”Bob Greenblatt, the chairman of NBC Entertainment (which has a show about a young Hannibal Lecter coming up), said, “There are a lot of parameters in broadcast television that we think about, not only as a company that has responsibilities to the F.C.C., but as people who have families.”Debates about television violence have waxed and waned for more than 50 years, sometimes surrounding shows, like “The Rifleman” and “Kojak,” that now seem tame. The increasing appeal of cable series, however, has changed the stakes. In 2001 Bob Wright, chairman of NBC at the time, wrote a memo pointing out an especially violent episode of “The Sopranos” on HBO and questioning whether “there was a lesson” for network shows in the popularity and acceptance of that level of violence.Cable series have become more violent and more popular in the years since. The six highest-rated dramas on cable in the past year were “The Walking Dead,” “Hatfields & McCoys,” “True Blood,” “Sons of Anarchy,” “American Horror Story,” and “Game of Thrones.” All contain high levels of violence.In an interview Mr. Reilly cited those shows and others, saying: “You look at the top scripted shows on cable, and they are all pretty heavy duty. These are not some small cultural little things that people like. The top drama on television now is a show where people get their heads blown off at point-blank range.”The show Mr. Reilly referred to, AMC’s “The Walking Dead,” is not the most-watched drama on television, but it does rank first among viewers between the ages of 18 and 49 — the audience that executives want to reach most because advertisers pay the most for them. (Over all the most popular drama is CBS’s “NCIS,” which, like virtually every CBS drama, features at least one murder every week.)On “The Walking Dead” a group of survivors from a dystopian upheaval are compelled to kill hosts of zombies in every episode. Sometimes those zombies are children.Mr. Reilly said the challenge for a network programmer is to compete with that kind of show on cable, which has never been held to the same strictures over content, while trying to maintain sensitivity to cultural standards, something still expected more of companies with broadcast licenses. The outcry over the shootings in Connecticut and elsewhere is clearly complicating that effort.“Had the incident in Connecticut not occurred, I think everybody would be saying ‘The Following’ is a great show, and you’re taking on cable at their own game,” Mr. Reilly said. He noted that AMC’s “Breaking Bad” is now among the most praised shows on television, but it is unquestionably dark and violent.“If you are going to be in this genre,” he said, “the bar is set at the level of shows like ‘Breaking Bad.’ You can’t come in lower and succeed.”The violence in “The Following” is occasionally graphic and disturbing: A woman stabs herself in the eye; a man goes through a street setting strangers on fire. Kevin Williamson, the show’s creator, said in one of the press sessions that he was disturbed by the Newtown incident and the earlier mass shooting at a movie theater in Aurora, Colo.“We sit in the writers’ room after that happened, and we just, sort of, we’re all traumatized by it,” Mr. Williamson said. “It reaches a moment where that just gets too real, and it’s very disturbing.” But he added: “I’m writing fiction. I’m just a storyteller.”John Landgraf, the president of FX, which programs hit dramas based on some level of violence like “America Horror Story” and “Justified,” stressed a distinction between what he called “third-person entertainment” and “first-person entertainment.” The former describes the passive viewing of scripted dramas; the latter describes participatory entertainment, like video games, where shooting and mayhem are personally inflicted on characters.He explicitly tied the prevalence of violence in the United States to the availability of guns, noting that television viewers in Britain watch the same shows as Americans and play the same video games, but that the country has drastically lower murder rates.“We should be looking at ourselves, but I think we have to look at what is most substantially responsible for this kind of violence,” Mr. Landgraf said. “One way to look at that is by looking at the rate at which it takes place in our country and other countries that don’t have access to those kinds of 100-round, 30-round assault-weapon guns.”He did not apologize, however, for the emphasis on life-or-death drama in FX’s shows.“We’re mammals,” he said. “Our greatest fear is death, and if you want to rivet people, you’re going to tend to hover around questions of life and death because that’s the thing that rivets our attention most naturally.”The Fox network has no intention of backing away from “The Following,” which stands as its most important show of a dismal season. Mr. Reilly plans to build his prime-time schedule partly around the show, perhaps using it exactly as AMC has been using “The Walking Dead,” in a pair of eight-episode bursts twice a season.“Most viewers compartmentalize,” Mr. Reilly said. “It’s apples and oranges in their lives. It’s entertainment vs. real life, fact and fiction. If you’re not crazy, you have a very easy time to separate the two, if you’re not a delusional human being — which is, thankfully, the vast majority of people in the world.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/business/media/south-park-creators-to-start-company-important-studios.html,"The creators of “South Park” are branching out beyond the underpants business.Taking after the Gnomes on the animated series who ardently practice American capitalism, Trey Parker and Matt Stone have wooed investors and raised money to form their own production studio, which they plan to announce on Monday.The new company is to be called Important Studios and hopes to be just that. With an estimated value of $300 million built on revenue from “South Park,” now in its 16th season on Comedy Central, and the Broadway megahit “The Book of Mormon,” the studio will have the power and money to approve television, movie and theater projects, including a big-screen version of “The Book of Mormon.”On Friday, Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone were putting together the final news release to announce their studio. They settled on this quip: “Having worked with several different studios over the years, we came to realize that our favorite people in the world are ourselves.”The pair will join a short line of Hollywood players who have formed their own studios as a way to gain control over the creative, production and distribution process.Merv Griffin created a television empire that he parlayed into real estate and other ventures. Dick Clark created Dick Clark Productions, which continued after his death last year. In 2006, the “American Idol” host Ryan Seacrest created Ryan Seacrest Productions, which produces reality shows including “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” and related spinoffs.Lately, those independent studios have become ripe for acquisition as media conglomerates look to expand their library of intellectual property and consumer products. In October, Disney said it would pay $4.05 billion in cash and stock for Lucasfilm, the production studio created by George Lucas, and the company that produced “Star Wars” and its lineup of lucrative sequels and prequels.Mr. Stone initially said he hoped Steven Spielberg’s DreamWorks or Mr. Lucas’s Lucasfilm could serve as a model for Important Studios, then paused for a moment. “In some ways it’s a stupid comparison because they are gargantuan,” he said. “We want to be a smaller, more humble version of that.”He continued: “If DreamWorks is Walmart, we are over here knitting sweaters.”The “South Park” creators have made millions and attracted both fans and detractors in satirizing everything from Christmas (celebrating the holiday with singing fecal matter) to Islamist extremism (depicting Muhammad in a bear suit) and race relations (naming one of the only black characters on the series Token).Important Studios will incorporate revenue from “South Park” and “The Book of Mormon,” as well as revenue from future projects. “The Book of Mormon,” one of the highest-grossing Broadway musicals in recent years, received nine Tony Awards in 2011 and has grossed more than $200 million.That amount continues to grow because the New York production makes $1.6 million a week, according to the producers. A touring version of the show makes about $1.6 million a week, and another production in Chicago grosses $1.5 million a week. And the show is about to go into production in London.Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker, who created the musical, are the largest shareholders in “The Book of Mormon,” followed by the film producer Scott Rudin and others. Among the first projects that Important Studios is likely to develop is a movie version of the musical.Mr. Stone said he and his partner had been considering forming an independent studio for almost two years. “At first we thought we’d get some money from a hedge fund or a Russian oligarch or something,” Mr. Stone said, seemingly half-joking.Instead, they teamed with a nascent Hollywood oligarch. Through their relationship with Ariel Z. Emanuel at the talent agency William Morris Endeavor Entertainment, they met Joseph Ravitch. Mr. Ravitch heads the Raine Group, a boutique merchant bank that focuses on entertainment, digital media and sports. (William Morris is an investor in Raine.)Mr. Ravitch, a former Goldman Sachs banker who advised on the sale of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and helped the N.B.A. set up its business in China, hit it off with the two men. Raine invested about $60 million in Important Studios in exchange for a stake of just under 20 percent. Mr. Stone called Raine “big brains with big Rolodexes” and said “the money has some intellect with it.”For his part, Mr. Ravitch said, “Our bet is they will create some exciting stuff over the next five years, and this allows them the creative and financial flexibility to own their future.”Invariably, Mr. Ravitch and his investors will eventually want to sell their stake, raising the prospect that Important Studios could ultimately be sold to a larger media company like Viacom.In the meantime, the deal speaks to a huge shift in power in the entertainment industry, thanks to the Internet and the changing ways people watch television. Creators like Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have the opportunity to have a more direct relationship with their millions of fans, potentially bypassing the traditional Hollywood machinery to promote new projects and make old ones available.“South Park,” in particular, is an early pioneer of making television available through online streaming. Even as Viacom, which owns Comedy Central, filed a lawsuit against Google over the unauthorized posting of clips of its shows on YouTube, factions within the company pushed to make episodes of “South Park” available free almost immediately after their initial broadcast.In a meeting in 2007 on online piracy, Erik Flannigan, executive vice president for digital media at the Viacom Entertainment Group, typed “South Park” into Google on a giant screen in a conference room. The first several Web sites that came up offered illegal pirated versions of the series. That put the impetus on the media company to make “South Park” available online, which sharply cut down on piracy.Its early and robust online presence gave “South Park” a more direct relationship with fans, which Mr. Stone said would help in introducing future projects.“Ten years ago, you needed that studio machinery to start cranking its marketing muscle,” Mr. Stone said. “Now we could market a movie-size project. We bring a lot of heft.”Mr. Stone said he and Mr. Parker hoped to use the new money to allow them to “be more prolific with less struggle.”“We want to have a little control over our life,” he explained. “We used to walk into a studio and try to become an employee. We’re done with that. We are too grown up for that.”Important Studios’ balance sheet will also probably give Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker more leverage when negotiating with other studios. Doug Herzog, president of the MTV Networks Entertainment Group, who brought “South Park” to Comedy Central, said of the new studio: “Bringing money to the table goes a long way. Money talks.” He said the studio would allow the two men “to pursue their vision in as pure a way as possible. Matt and Trey with a lot of money. Be afraid.”Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker have had an unlikely journey to moguldom. After meeting at the University of Colorado in Boulder in 1992, the two introduced a stop-motion animated short called “The Spirit of Christmas” (known as “Jesus vs. Frosty”). A second Christmas-inspired short film, known as “Jesus vs. Santa,” had its debut in 1995 and further built the team’s cult following.In 2007, Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker, with the help of their lawyer, Kevin Morris, cut a sweetheart deal with Comedy Central: a 50-50 joint venture on all revenue not related to television. That meant the two men have had a huge stake in the all-important digital rights to “South Park” as well as movies, soundtracks, “Oh my God! They Killed Kenny!” T-shirts and other merchandise. That deal was said to be worth $75 million for the two men. Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker are at work on a second “South Park” video game.Despite their goofy characters and collaborations, Mr. Stone said, “We’re closet responsible.” Of course, even with a couple of hits under their belts, nothing is foolproof. “We could fall flat on our faces,” he said."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/movies/awardsseason/a-night-for-saluting-women-at-the-golden-globes.html,"At a time when President Obama is under attack for appointing so many white men — and so few women — to senior positions in the White House, Hollywood seemed intent Sunday on correcting the imbalance at the Golden Globes.Ricky Gervais took the awards to the edge of puerile bullying three years in a row, but Tina Fey and Amy Poehler brought charm and easy good humor to a ceremony where stars are supposed to relax and have fun.And it was one of the more amusing awards shows because of it. The two comedians were gentle — up to a point. In their opening, Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler pointed out Kathryn Bigelow and made a joke about the controversy over her film “Zero Dark Thirty.” Ms. Poehler said, “When it comes to torture, I trust a lady who spent three years married to James Cameron.” The camera panned to stars looking a little shocked as they laughed.It wasn’t the only Girl Power moment. Former President Bill Clinton was met with a standing ovation when he arrived to introduce the Steven Spielberg film “Lincoln.” But it was Ms. Poehler who got the biggest laugh when she returned to the stage and said rapturously, “That was Hillary Clinton’s husband.”Female wunderkinds of every age seemed to dominate the night, including Jodie Foster, a former child star who was awarded the Cecil B. DeMille Lifetime Achievement Award, and the newcomer Lena Dunham, the creator and star of “Girls.”Ms. Foster, long reticent about her personal life, gave a brilliant, somewhat incomprehensible soliloquy that was almost a coming-out speech, but then veered away. (It was like Garbo talks, then Garbo is garbled.) Ms. Dunham accepted for best actress in a TV comedy by saying somewhat tremulously that other, more senior nominees for the award, like Ms. Fey and Julia Louis-Dreyfus, were the comfort of her youth. Ms. Fey underlined the slight by saying sarcastically, “Congratulations, Lena, I’m glad we got you through middle school.”Julianne Moore, who won best actress in a television movie for her depiction of Sarah Palin in the HBO film “Game Change,” made a point of saluting two women who had nothing to do with the film but everything with exposing Ms. Palin’s weaknesses: Ms. Fey, who impersonated Ms. Palin on “Saturday Night Live,” and Katie Couric, whose interviews with Ms. Palin during the 2008 election campaign provided Ms. Fey with raw material for her parody.And one of the most unlikely star turns was by Aida Takla O’Reilly, the president of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, a group that is often mocked but is not known for having a sense of humor. Ms. Takla O’Reilly said, “I know that Jeffrey Katzenberg will never forget my name, because he never knew it in the first place.”In so many studied efforts at levity, lapses are all the more glaring. British actors are known for their witty good manners at awards shows, but Damian Lewis, who won best actor in a TV drama for “Homeland,” thanked many colleagues and friends but didn’t even mention his co-star, Claire Danes — one of the more startling omissions since Hilary Swank forgot to thank her husband at the time, Chad Lowe. (When Ms. Dunham was onstage after winning the award for best comedy or musical TV series, she made an oblique reference to that slip, joking, “I also promised myself that if I ever got this chance, I would thank Chad Lowe.”)Most of the women were studiously gracious in victory (except the pop singer Adele, who used a rather salty Britishism to describe how much she was enjoying the show). While accepting her award, Jennifer Lawrence made a joke about beating out Meryl Streep, but praised her co-star Bradley Cooper and also the producer Harvey Weinstein, whom she thanked for “killing whoever you had to kill to get me up here today.” Anne Hathaway, who won for best supporting actress in a movie, even reached out to one of her rivals for the award, thanking Sally Field, nominated for playing the president’s wife in “Lincoln,” for being “a vanguard against typecasting” by going from “The Flying Nun” to “Norma Rae.” (Ms. Hathaway rose to fame as the star of “The Princess Diaries.”)And it could be that all the female success has left a pall on some of the men.On the red carpet before the show Jay Leno gave the hosts of the night a backhanded compliment: he called Ms. Fey and Ms. Poehler “two of the funniest women I know,” then added of Ms. Poehler’s sitcom: “ ‘Parks and Recreation’ is my wife’s favorite show. She never misses it.”Ms. Poehler had the last laugh, closing the show by saying of herself and Ms. Fey, “We’re going home with Jodie Foster.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/business/media/conde-nast-contracts-cut-authors-share-in-film-deals.html,"It’s a dream tucked in the backs of many journalists’ minds: the article they write becomes a blockbuster movie and they reap a healthy share of the profits, a walk on the red carpet and — who knows? — maybe even an Oscar.At Condé Nast magazines like Wired, Vanity Fair and The New Yorker, that wish has become reality for a small but steady number of writers. Condé Nast articles led to the movie “Argo,” which so far has generated $166 million in worldwide box-office sales, “Eat Pray Love,” which made $204 million in global sales and “Brokeback Mountain,” which brought in $178 million.But now, Condé Nast, whose magazines are battling a punishing business environment, wants to capture more of the film and television profits, which previously went to writers who owned the rights to these works. The new contracts have angered writers and their agents who argue that it’s another cut at their already rapidly shrinking compensation.“It doesn’t give authors the option or the alternative to go elsewhere for their movie and television rights, and therefore there’s no competition,” said Jan Constantine, general counsel for the Authors Guild who recently advised an agent negotiating one of these contracts.According to copies of the various contracts provided and described to The New York Times, those exclusive rights ranged from 30 days to one year. The contracts also show that if Condé Nast decides to option the article, writers receive $2,500 to $5,000 for a 12-month option. If an article is developed into a major feature film, writers receive no more than 1 percent or $150,000 toward the purchase price.Television programs and made-for-television movies are capped at even lower amounts, especially for less experienced writers. These arrangements are agreed to before an article has even been published.“This is bottom-of-the-barrel pricing,” said one agent who refused to allow writers to sign the new contracts, but declined to be identified for fear of retribution toward the agent’s clients. “There’s no reason my clients who are the premier writers in the country should be shackled by this agreement that forces them to accept very low prices and also take their project off the market.”Many writers for Condé Nast magazines like The New Yorker work under one-year contracts that lack basic employee benefits like a 401(k) retirement plan or health insurance, but they are allowed to keep the rights to their work. (By contrast, newspapers typically own the full rights to articles published by their employees.)Some agents have warned writers not to sign the contracts because they chip away further at their income. But other writers have signed the agreements because they don’t want to lose the chance to have their byline appear in The New Yorker or Vanity Fair.Writers interviewed for this article who have contracts with Condé Nast emphasized that in this economy they can’t simply go out and get a contract with another magazine.One longtime contract writer used the proceeds from an option to pay for medical bills resulting from an injury caused during reporting in the Middle East.Some writers predict that these contracts will create an even wider divide between Condé Nast’s most celebrated writers and its stable of lesser known but productive contributors.“The people who really get the big options are not going to sign, and the people who don’t get the big options are going to be railroaded,” said one Condé Nast writer who asked not to be identified because of fears of retribution from the company. “What you are really taking is people’s self-respect.”The plans to secure more of these rights started in late 2011, when Condé Nast formed an entertainment group to help it secure some of the profits its writers received when their articles were developed into film and television programs.In the past, Condé Nast struggled to profit from many of the programs made about its publications. For example, it did not receive any of the $6.4 million made at the global box office for “The September Issue,” a documentary about Vogue.In late 2011, the company hired Dawn Ostroff, previously president of the CW television network, to run the entertainment group. While a Condé Nast spokesman declined to talk about the specific contract negotiations, the spokesman said the company hopes to offer its writers more development options through the new entertainment group.“As we expand into digital, film and television entertainment, we are excited to bring the extraordinary work of our writers and photographers to these platforms, showcase their content in new ways, and create expanded opportunities for their work to be enjoyed by new audiences,” the spokesman said.But writers and agents remain skeptical of how many projects will actually be developed. Although Charles H. Townsend, chief executive of Condé Nast, said in October that the division is developing 15 projects, the entertainment group has not officially announced any of them. Some agents said they fear that Condé Nast does not have enough muscle in the entertainment world to make these deals happen.“They’re not a film company,” the agent said. “There are many other companies who are not in the movie business who tried to do a land grab and it doesn’t work.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/sports/baseball/giants-left-their-hearts-at-coogans-bluff.html,"Once they were the darlings of Coogan’s Bluff, but now the San Francisco Giants are the darlings of a bar in New York’s East Village as well as thousands of passionate baseball fans back East who stay up late to root.For the last two decades, the Giants have acknowledged their inner Christy Mathewson, their inner Monte Irvin, as part of their heritage. Did this help them win the World Series in 2010 and 2012? Well, Posey and Sandoval did not hurt.A cadre of Giants, including one Willie Howard Mays Jr., will return to the ancestral home in the next week to be honored for the most recent Series victory. This organization is touching all the spiritual bases.During the World Series of 2010, I wandered the halls in the ballpark in China Basin and loved seeing old photographs of wondrous doings in a far-off time and land — Mel Ott, Sal Maglie. The Giants had names from their glorious past tossing out the first ball — McCovey, Cepeda, Perry, Marichal, Irvin, Bobby Thomson’s family, Dave Dravecky. They invited Barry Bonds, who is part of the history. A few days later, they polished off the Texas Rangers for their first championship since Leo Durocher and Dusty Rhodes in 1954. I wrote a column that began with two words: Karma counts.“There was a ticker-tape parade in 1958,” said Larry Baer, the president of the Giants, who cherishes history as a partner of profit. “We replicated that in 2010.”Baer and the current ownership also honored the haunts of the ancient past. Two years ago, Mays visited Public School 46 in Harlem, where the Polo Grounds once stood. This week, Buster Posey will make a private visit to the Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center in Little Falls, N.J., for some catcher talk.The Giants are coming home for a visit. That is their attitude, and it is a marvelous one. By honoring their past, they have illuminated their present. At the moment, they generate more emotional wattage in New York than the franchise hunkered down in the marshes of Flushing.Does karma really matter? Why did it take 86 years for the Boston Red Sox to get past the disposal of Babe Ruth? What miasma hangs over the North Side of Chicago? How long will the creepy smirk of Bernie Madoff haunt the Mets?For a long time, the Giants seemed haunted by some malediction from their departure from New York. At the same time, the Los Angeles Dodgers, pursued by outright hatred from Brooklyn for being the alleged instigators of the move to California, won five World Series while the Giants failed, often with comparable talent.In 1992, with the team facing a possible move to Florida, Peter Magowan of Safeway, a New Yorker who had coincidentally moved to San Francisco in 1958, joined a new ownership team put together by Baer. (There are now 32 owners, with Charles B. Johnson, chairman of Franklin Resources, the largest single shareholder.)“We wanted to celebrate the connections to New York, and not deny it or minimize it,” said Baer, comparing his hometown, San Francisco, to New York, where he worked for a decade. I told Baer I have always thought of San Francisco, with its bustling waterfront, as European — Genoa or Istanbul or Naples or Barcelona.“When you live in Northern California, this big thing, this elephant in the room, is the rivalry with L.A.,” Baer said. “We feel more like New York or Boston. We think of ourselves as a city. The City. Longtime San Franciscans call it the City. L.A. is the biggest city in California, but we are a city like New York or Boston, with a central business district, people go downtown for entertainment, to the opera, the symphony, the theater, the ballpark.” He also compared New York and San Francisco because of ingenuity, electronics, energy.Some of this is marketing babble, but the Giants made the visceral connection with an expedition to deepest Gotham in January 2011 for the baseball writers’ annual dinner, and they came bearing superstars and hardware.They also had the acuity to accept an invitation from a sports bar, Finnerty’s on East 14th Street. Two new owners, Brian Stapleton and Dieter Seelig, had been renovating its East Village funk for a year, trying to induce patrons to stop and have a beer, anything. One bartender invited some friends of hers to root for the San Francisco 49ers on Sundays, and some began coming back for the Giants.“Ten-thirty on weekday nights,” Seelig said the other day. “We’re open till 4 a.m., and sometimes, those games don’t end till 3 a.m. The night Matt Cain pitched his perfect game, people began coming over at midnight and stayed till the end. We must have had 60 people here.”Finnerty’s gained a reputation as a Giants bar, much the way there is a trend toward soccer pubs for specific teams, cricket and rugby pubs, Steelers bars, college football bars, you name it, Seelig said.Could the success and new bicoastal reach of the Giants cut into the popularity of the Mets? What popularity? you ask. The cash-poor Mets are trudging into the new season without one legitimate major league outfielder, not a good omen in Front-Runner City.Seelig says Finnerty’s sends busloads of Giants fans to Queens — 200 tickets for each of four Giants games last April. Many of his patrons are transplants from the Bay Area, Seelig added, saying, “I don’t think they’d become Met or Yankee fans.” He does not see the Giants as a threat to the Mets. It’s all good for business, he suggested.Are the Giants touching hearts and minds back East? Stan Isaacs, the great sports columnist at Newsday for many decades, grew up a Giants fan — in Brooklyn, no less. Isaacs, 83, said he hated Horace Stoneham for moving the franchise, but added that recently, “I was delighted by the act of emblazoning the words of Russ Hodges — ‘the Giants win the pennant,’ the historic call,” from 1951, in faraway San Francisco. The Giants painted the quotation on a wall of the ballpark’s club level. Isaacs admits it: he’s rooting for his old team again.Christopher Russo, the Mad Dog himself, now yapping away weekday afternoons on SiriusXM satellite radio, has been a Giants fan since childhood, long after the team’s defection. Russo can recite the horrors of 1993 and the 2000 postseason loss to the Mets, as well as the nastiness of the Bonds era. This team, Russo pronounced, “is likable,” and has won two Series. “I never thought I’d see the day,” the Mad Dog barked.The Giants might also be candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, having brought together opposing Giants fan clubs. This sounds like one of those New York jokes (“that other congregation, you wouldn’t catch me dead in”), but this schism really exists between the New York Baseball Giants Nostalgia Society and the New York Giants Preservation Society, offshoots of a faded group whose name must not be spoken.Having once covered religion, I felt right at home delving into this. The Nostalgia people are a mix of old fans and young fans who meet periodically to talk about the Giants. For that matter, so are the Preservation people.When the Giants come to New York, both groups will meet Mays & Company at a Midtown hotel. Together. “They have a truce,” Baer said. “A détente.”Bill Kent is the leader of the Nostalgia group. The highlight of his early childhood was watching the lumbering slugger Ernie Lombardi chasing a pal of Kent’s around the field during batting practice. (Old Giants fans know right away that the Schnozz never did catch the little kid.) Kent says that at meetings of the Nostalgia group, “We go into the twilight zone” and become little kids again.Gary Mintz is the leader of the Preservation group. He is 51, a schoolteacher, and honors the Giants in memory of his dad, Louis. “I’d wake up every morning and ask him the score” from the Giants’ West Coast games, Mintz said in a husky voice. Last year, a group of Preservation people made the hegira to San Francisco and were honored before the game. Then Magowan led the group into the glass-enclosed office of the clubhouse manager Miguel Murphy, who has worked for the team since 1958. There, the Preservation people got to shake hands with Mays. Mintz is still glowing.Murphy’s office may be the emotional center of the franchise. He has been there since Seals Stadium, since Candlestick Park, and now China Basin, and knows all the secrets. Ownership has encouraged him to make his office the home for former players. I do not know any other major franchise where old-timers gather so routinely.“For any home game, Willie Mays and Willie McCovey are there,” Baer said. “Plus Orlando Cepeda, Will Clark, Vida Blue, plus visual depictions of Mathewson, McGraw.” He says it is funny to watch a new Giant take a gulp of air and tiptoe into Murphy’s sanctum and introduce himself to one or more deities who tell him to sit down and talk awhile.“We’re not just winning for the 25 guys in uniform today but also for the hundreds or thousands of guys who have worn the uniform over 131 years,” Baer said.Baer says the Giants are no threat to the popularity of the Mets or the Yankees. Nonetheless, they will surely sell tickets as they visit the two boroughs (Queens, Sept. 17-19, and the Bronx, Sept. 20-22). Six Giants games in their old city in 2013. They’re not moving back to Coogan’s Bluff, but they have honored their roots. Karma still counts."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/media/in-hollywood-movies-for-china-bureaucrats-want-a-say.html,"LOS ANGELES — When “Kung Fu Panda 3” kicks its way into China’s theaters in 2016, the country’s vigilant film censors will find no nasty surprises.After all, they have already dropped in to monitor the movie at the DreamWorks Animation campus here. And the story line, production art and other creative elements have met their approval.The lure of access to China’s fast-growing film market — now the world’s second largest, behind that of the United States — is entangling studios and moviemakers with the state censors of a country in which American notions of free expression simply do not apply.Whether studios are seeking to distribute a completed film in China or join with a Chinese company for a co-production shot partly in that country, they have discovered that navigating the murky, often shifting terrain of censorship is part of the process.Billions of dollars ride on whether they get it right. International box-office revenue is the driving force behind many of Hollywood’s biggest films, and often plays a deciding role in whether a movie is made. Studios rely on consultants and past experience — and increasingly on informal advance nods from foreign officials — to help gauge whether a film will pass censorship; if there are problems they can sometimes be addressed through appeal and subsequent negotiations.But Paramount Pictures just learned the hard way that some things won’t pass muster — like American fighter pilots in dogfights with MIGs. The studio months ago submitted a new 3-D version of “Top Gun” to Chinese censors. The ensuing silence was finally recognized as rejection.Problems more often affect films that touch the Chinese directly. “Any movie about China made by outsiders is going to be very sensitive,” said Rob Cohen, who directed “The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor,” among the first in a wave of co-productions between American studios — in this case, Universal Pictures — and Chinese companies.One production currently facing scrutiny is Disney and Marvel’s “Iron Man 3,” parts of which were filmed in Beijing in the last month. It proceeded under the watchful eye of Chinese bureaucrats, who were invited to the set and asked to advise on creative decisions, according to people briefed on the production who asked for anonymity to avoid conflict with government or company officials. Marvel and Disney had no comment.Another prominent film, Ang Lee’s “Life of Pi,” which was nominated last week for 11 Academy Awards, made it through the process mostly unscathed, but got some pushback over a line in which a character declared that “religion is darkness.”“They modified the translation a little, for fear of provoking religious people,” Mr. Lee said.Hollywood as a whole is shifting toward China-friendly fantasies that will fit comfortably within a revised quota system, which allows more international films to be distributed in China, where 3-D and large-format Imax pictures are particularly favored.At the same time, it is avoiding subject matter and situations that are likely to cause conflict with the roughly three dozen members of a censorship board run by China’s powerful State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, or S.A.R.F.T.In addition, some studios are quietly asking Chinese officials for assurance that planned films, even when they do not have a Chinese theme, will have no major censorship problems.The censorship bureau did not respond to a list of questions submitted by The New York Times seeking information about its process and guidelines.Studios are quickly discovering that a key to access in China is the inclusion of Chinese actors, story lines and locations. But the more closely a film examines China, the more likely it is to collide with shifting standards, unwritten rules and unfamiliar political powers who hold sway over what can be seen on the country’s roughly 12,000 movie screens.Mr. Cohen’s “Mummy” film, which was shot throughout China in 2007, was a historical fantasy about an evil emperor who is magically resurrected by foreign adventurers in 1946. The script was preapproved by China’s censorship board with only token changes — the emperor’s name had to be fictionalized, for instance. The censors also cautioned that the ancient ruler should not resemble Mao Zedong.On reviewing the finished film, however, they found a deeper problem that “we didn’t have any way of seeing, or any way of fixing,” Mr. Cohen said: “White Westerners were saving China.” The picture was approved, he said, but its release was delayed until it had played elsewhere in the world, and pirated versions took a bite out of the Chinese box-office receipts.For Americans, dealings with the Chinese censors are mostly a distant and secondhand business. Films are normally submitted by their Chinese partners, while various consultants in China handle the bureaucratic communications that lead to approval or rejection.But those who shoot in China often assume that censorship officials have eyes and ears on the set. “There were points where we were shooting with a crew of 500 people,” said Mr. Cohen of his movie. “I’m not sure who was who or what, but knowing the way the system works, it’s completely clear that had we deviated from the script, it would not have gone unnoticed.”In a 2011 Web post, Robert Cain, a producer and consultant who guides filmmakers through China’s system, described having worked in Shanghai on a romantic comedy that went off script; the director included a take in which an extra, holding a camcorder, pretended to be a theater patron taping a movie on a screen.The next day, Mr. Cain and others involved with the film were summoned to the office of a Communist Party member who told them the film was being shut down for its “naïve” and “untruthful” portrayal of film piracy. Assuming they had been reported by a spy on their crew, the producers apologized and managed to keep the film on track.Studios are seeking out official co-productions, in which a Chinese company works with an American studio in financing and creating a film, because they can bypass the Chinese quota system and bring their distributors a 43 percent share of ticket sales, rather than the 25 percent allotted to foreign-made films.Co-productions like “Kung Fu Panda 3” draw close monitoring by the censors at every step. Scripts are submitted in advance. Representatives of S.A.R.F.T., according to Mr. Cohen and others, may be present on the set to guard against any deviation. And there is an unofficial expectation that the government’s approved version of the film will be seen both in China and elsewhere, though in practice it is not unusual for co-productions to slip through the system with differing versions, one for China, one for elsewhere in the world.Questions about how Chinese forces are shaping American movies are now playing out in the making of “Iron Man 3,” which is set for release on May 3.Disney and its Marvel unit want “Iron Man 3” to gain co-production status, partly because the previous two “Iron Man” movies performed well in China. To work toward that distinction, Disney and Marvel made a deal last year for Beijing-based DMG Entertainment to join in producing and financing the film.But they have taken a middle-of-the-road approach that appears intended to limit Chinese meddling in the creative process. A finished script was not submitted for approval and the companies have not yet made an application for official designation as a co-production. Rather, they are trying to show a heightened sense of cooperation in hopes the government will approve the status once that application is formally made in the spring.The producers made a presentation to censors early in the process, describing broad strokes of the story, the history of other Marvel and Disney movies, and plans to integrate Chinese characters into the movie.That won a conceptual sign-off for the film, which is being directed by Shane Black. Next, bureaucrats were invited to the set and were able to meet the star, Robert Downey Jr.Hollywood executives are only now becoming familiar with the censorship board and its workings. A recent count by one of their advisers found that the board has 37 members, including representatives from government agencies and interest groups, like the Communist Youth League and the Women’s Federation, along with filmmakers, academics and professional bureaucrats.At the top of S.A.R.F.T. is Cai Fuchao, a recent member of the Communist Party Central Committee. In a previous municipal post in Beijing, he was widely reported to have policed Web sites for banned material with the help of 10,000 volunteers, and to have joined in a roundup of a million illegally published books in 2004.In 2008, after an uproar over the release of Ang Lee’s “Lust, Caution,” whose story of wartime love and collaboration caused unease even after sex scenes were deleted, written censorship guidelines were circulated in China, in what filmmakers there took to be a crackdown.Some of the prohibitions were broad, barring violations of the fundamental principles of the Constitution and the harming of social morality. Others were more pointed. Disparagement of the People’s Liberation Army and the police were banned, as were “murder, violence, horrors, ghosts, demons and supernaturalism.”In all, the standards would appear to clash with almost any American film, other than, perhaps, the PG-rated animated fare of a DreamWorks Animation. (Even “Kung Fu Panda” provoked objections by some Chinese, who saw the lead character as profaning a nationally revered animal.)But some who have dealt with S.A.R.F.T. say the censors are often pragmatic, and appear to walk a line between the demands of viewers, who want more global fare, and those of politicians, who are out to protect the status quo.For example, 20th Century Fox managed to get “Life of Pi” through with only the modification of the “religion is darkness” line, despite the movie’s spiritual themes — which tread close to a prohibition against the preaching of cult beliefs and superstitions — and the earlier trouble over “Lust, Caution.”For Americans, the hard part is knowing what might suddenly cause trouble — initial approvals notwithstanding. In 2009, Sony Pictures and its partner, the China Film Group, submitted their script for “The Karate Kid” to China’s censors, and dutifully changed parts of the story to suit them. But the finished film was rejected, according to people who were briefed on the process, essentially because film bureaucrats were unhappy that its villain was Chinese.After negotiation, 12 minutes of the film were cut, and it was released in China, though later than intended.Some filmmakers here suggest that impositions by the China censors are similar to the restrictions imposed by a ratings system administered by the Motion Picture Association of America. But Joan Graves, the chairwoman of Hollywood’s ratings board, insists otherwise. “We’re the only major country with a ratings system that does it on a voluntary basis,” she said.Steven Soderbergh, whose film “Contagion” was shot partly in Hong Kong, said the participation of China’s censors simply added to the chorus of input that surrounds every big-budget filmmaker.“I’m not morally offended or outraged,” Mr. Soderbergh said. “It’s fascinating to listen to people’s interpretations of your story.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/arts/music/yo-la-tengos-fade-and-cristina-patos-migrations.html,"YO LA TENGO“Fade” (Matador)Even when feedback is screeching at the fringes, a certain serenity prevails throughout “Fade,” the 13th album by the long-running Hoboken band Yo La Tengo. Time, mortality and lifelong companionship are very much on the minds of Yo La Tengo’s husband-and-wife songwriters, the guitarist Ira Kaplan and the drummer Georgia Hubley, who started the band in 1984 and are now in their 50s. “Days just fade away, slide into gray,” Mr. Kaplan sings in “Stupid Things,” continuing, “Where does that time go before our eyes?”Stability isn’t a prime topic for rock songs; there’s more drama in crushes and breakups, revenge and self-pity. But through the years Yo La Tengo has, both quietly and noisily, chronicled the decades as a couple, as a rock band and as ordinary people maturing. As singers Mr. Kaplan and Ms. Hubley have each leveraged vocal limitations into a heartfelt yet undemonstrative style; as songwriters they allude to sounds and approaches from a broad, record-connoisseur’s canon, from 1960s-rooted pop-rock to new wave concision to extended guitar freakouts, though “Fade” keeps its songs under seven minutes.For “Fade,” Yo La Tengo has found a new producer, switching from its longtime collaborator Roger Moutenot to John McEntire, the drummer for the instrumental band Tortoise and a master of subtly layered sounds and meditative, evolving arrangements. The songs on “Fade” often well up out of studio ambience, as if forming themselves on the spot; close listening reveals sounds tucked almost subliminally into the mix.Together Mr. McEntire and Yo La Tengo have calmed and thickened the band’s music — revisiting, in some ways, the approach Yo La Tengo took on its 2000 album, “And Then Nothing Turned Itself Inside-Out.” On its most recent previous album, “Popular Songs” from 2009, Yo La Tengo was joshing and sardonic at times, but “Fade” stays serious and pensive, unafraid to whisper through most of the songs.For songs about constancy, Yo La Tengo finds musical metaphors in drones and unswerving drumbeats. “Ohm,” which starts the album, is a one-chord song, strummed steadily amid gusts of percussion and guitar distortion; “Stupid Things” uses the motoric beat and repeating motifs of Kraut-rock. Behind the folky guitar and cozy horns of “Cornelia and Jane” is a nonstop metronomic tapping, as Ms. Hubley sings, perhaps to someone desperately ill, “How can we hold on to you?”Yo La Tengo hasn’t abandoned rock; “Paddle Forward” has the surge and crunch of a Replacements song. But “Fade” prizes thoughtfulness and acceptance, not aggression; it finds solace in simple, shared comforts. In the album’s concluding song, “Before We Run,” Ms. Hubley sings, “Hold me in your arms, be still/ I’ll hold you in mine.” JON PARELESCRISTINA PATO“Migrations” (Sunnyside)Cristina Pato reaches what sounds like full steam only a handful of times on her perfectly titled new album, “Migrations,” and that touch of restraint feels strategic and knowing. Ms. Pato is a pianist of percussive clarity, and a flutist and singer of warmer, softer effect. But the instrument on which she slays is the gaita, a bagpipe of traditional use in Galicia, her homeland in the northwest corner of Spain. She’s a virtuoso, and when she opens the floodgates of her technique, as she does on an Emilio Solla tune called “Remain Alert,” the force can knock you back a few steps. She knows to use it sparingly.She also knows, perhaps through her experience in Yo-Yo Ma’s Silk Road Ensemble, that authenticity and adaptability can be compatible under the right conditions. “Migrations,” with its suggestion of an itinerant and even mongrelized cultural legacy, sets the stage nicely for her: it’s an album suffused with awareness of tradition but breezy about its debts.The history of the gaita stretches back centuries, into a shrouded antiquity. Its popular resurgence in recent years is less mysterious, involving the pageantry of Galician pipe bands and the easy flair of players like Carlos Nuñez. As if to offer a dose of reassurance, Ms. Pato includes a few folkloric themes here, stacking them near the album’s close.But she opens with “Muiñeira for Cristina,” an original take on a traditional form, by the Galician accordionist Victor Prieto. It features a sparkling guest turn by the Colombian harpist Edmar Castañeda, and assertive rhythmic work by Ms. Pato’s core band, with Mr. Prieto, the bassist Edward Pérez, the drummer Eric Doob and the percussionist John Hadfield. (She’ll have the same lineup at the Jazz Standard on Tuesday night.)Ms. Pato is a dynamic improviser, not afraid to use the shrill keen of her instrument as an expressive tool. She has the added benefit of some smart arrangements — by Mr. Solla, an Argentine pianist known for blending jazz and tango — that embrace a kind of world-music utopianism, stirring in tabla, bouzouki and cello. She puts herself forward as an ambassador of this ideal, especially on Mr. Solla’s “Gaitango (A Cristina Pato),” which has her playing gaita and piano, and her own “Rosiña,” featuring flute and vocals.Her breathy singing, on “Rosiña” as on the bossa-nova standard “Dindi,” is nothing special. But any trace of vulnerability is welcome, on an album that otherwise makes little accommodation for it. NATE CHINEN"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/sports/hip-injury-sidelines-skating-champion.html,"The two-time United States champion Alissa Czisny withdrew from next week’s nationals after dislocating her left hip Saturday in Appleton, Wis."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/arts/television/real-husbands-of-hollywood-and-lack-of-black-male-leads.html,"Early in the premiere of “Real Husbands of Hollywood,” the comedian Kevin Hart shows up for an afternoon party at a huge Los Angeles home where the grill is being tended by Nick Cannon, the actor, comedian and husband of Mariah Carey.Mr. Hart is impressed, and agitated.“Where she get this house?” he says, referring to Ms. Carey. “I ain’t know she had this house.”Mr. Cannon, wearing an “I ♥ Mimi” apron, is peeved. “First off, this is my house,” he snaps. “I bought this house before I got married to Mariah.”Mr. Cannon is famous too. Or was. That’s part of the implicit conceit of this clever sitcom starting Tuesday on BET — part scripted and part improvised — in which all of the stars play lightly parodic versions of themselves. In addition to Mr. Hart and Mr. Cannon the show features Boris Kodjoe, Duane Martin and J B Smoove, black actors with drawing power but who on this show are presented as do-nothing spouses with oodles of idle time.“Real Husbands” purports to be a gender-flipped satire of reality-TV new-money battles royale, the sort that feature would-be socialites. But it’s actually a far more subtle commentary on the death of the black male romantic lead, a reminder of the limited options for black actors on television.At different points each of these actors has been a leading man in television or film. Mr. Kodjoe, a former model, was a star of the TV series “Soul Food” and of the short-lived “Undercovers,” a rare network show with a black couple in the lead. Mr. Martin was a star of the sitcom “All of Us.” Mr. Cannon was the star of the film “Drumline” and of several TV shows for young people.Those days are gone. The age of black sitcoms and dramas is largely over, replaced instead with token diversity. While that may mean high times for black character actors, traditional leading men are getting the short end of the stick.Hence “Real Husbands” as commentary: Here are well-regarded actors reduced to parody, and reduced to sharing the air, on a show that is a satire of emasculation. Mr. Hart, the protagonist — he is also one of the executive producers — is whiny and unappealing, which is the point. Of all the stars he’s meant to be the one with the biggest current fame, the one still on the rise. But at every turn he gets his comeuppance, whether by Mr. Cannon’s nephew, who beats him up, or by Robin Thicke, who socially undermines him.The most romantically appealing character is Mr. Thicke, the soul singer, who is white, another comment on the diminished potency of black male leads.The “Real Husbands” theme first appeared during the 2011 BET Awards, in a series of interstitial shorts that starred an excitable Mr. Hart along with Mr. Cannon, the rapper Nelly and Bobby Brown, who played the paterfamilias with dry senility. (“I started this househusband thing, you know,” Mr. Brown says in the first short. “I was the first one to land me one of the big fish.”) In 2012 they returned, this time with Mr. Hart waging war against Samuel L. Jackson, who takes over Mr. Hart’s home.Those sketches were funnier, at least partly because they were so unexpected, but also because they were much closer to the peak reality-TV moments they were parodying. But now that that phenomenon seems to be receding somewhat, “Real Husbands” makes the most sense when read against the almost total vacuum of black male lead characters on network and cable television, especially romantic leads, a vacuum made all the more glaring by the rise of dramas with black female leads like “Scandal” on ABC and now “Deception” on NBC.Instead, on the broadcast networks black men are often relegated to sidekick status — think of Lamorne Morris’s Winston on “New Girl” — creating a panoply of diverse faces in roles that don’t threaten the racial dynamics of their shows. The closest to a lead is Damon Wayans Jr. as Brad on “Happy Endings,” though this season he’s lost his job and become increasingly disempowered, going from being the most potent black male character in prime time to one of the dullest.The situation is better on cable than on the networks, of course — there’s Don Cheadle on “House of Lies,” for example — but not much. And there are plenty of shows with no black characters of note at all.Still, Mr. Wayans, a son of a Wayans brother (of “In Living Color”) is more effective than the junior-league members of his extended family on “Second Generation Wayans,” which has its premiere after “Real Husbands” and stars two of his cousins, Damien Dante Wayans and Craig Wayans.“Second Generation” is a show about the futility of coming close to success but not quite sticking the landing, based in part on Damien and Craig’s own Hollywood misadventures. The Wayans name is a door opener, but it’s also an albatross that prevents the family’s younger talents from being appreciated on their own merits, the show argues. It also reflects a generational shift. In the 1990s, when their first generation was succeeding, networks were more concerned with making black-themed television.But that interest has waned, leaving the field to Tyler Perry and BET. The younger Wayans may be talented — Craig in particular exudes an appealing pathos, an implied eye roll about this whole venture that gives the show some gravity — but they arrived at the wrong time.There is one young show, though, that has recently gone out of its way to put black male sexuality on display. Two minutes into the season premiere of “Girls” on Sunday night Lena Dunham is depicted in intense, sweaty commingling with Donald Glover, who even in his role as the group’s jock on “Community” has never been painted as a heartthrob. (Based on subsequent episodes the relationship appears to have an expiration date.)Ms. Dunham, who was derided during her show’s first season for her monochromatic casting, may just be answering her critics here, or tweaking them. Even if that’s the case, in so doing she’s also highlighted what’s missing all around her and issued a challenge to everyone to keep up."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/arts/television/richard-pryor-and-dick-cheney-focus-of-showtime-documentaries.html,"The pay cable channel Showtime has been closing the gap with the rival HBO in the realm of original series — an achievement rewarded with a strong showing at Sunday’s Golden Globes ceremony — but one major distinction has remained: HBO has long been the channel with a commitment to attention-grabbing original documentaries, and Showtime the channel without.Now, with the Sundance Film Festival premiere of “The World According to Dick Cheney” scheduled for Friday, Showtime is attempting to grab some documentary buzz for itself.The film, directed by R. J. Cutler and Greg Finton, to be broadcast on Showtime on March 15, will inaugurate a new strand of original documentaries, called “Sho Closeup.” Other individuals getting the documentary treatment this year include the comedian Richard Pryor; Lawrence Taylor, the former New York Giants linebacker; and Muammar el-Qaddafi, the Libyan dictator who was killed in 2011. In April Showtime will broadcast “Suge Knight: American Dream/American Knightmare,” from the director Antoine Fuqua (“Training Day”), who persuaded Mr. Knight, the founder of Death Row Records, to discuss the murders of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G.Unlike HBO, which often tackles issues (from hydraulic fracturing to Middle East peace), Showtime will focus on high-profile, controversial personalities, including Mr. Cheney, the former vice president, who, in an interview last summer, reflected on his role in the Iraq war.“I’m interested in the psychology of culture-moving personalities; that’s what connects Richard Pryor and Dick Cheney,” said Showtime’s president of entertainment, David Nevins, who has been involved in the films’ development and suggested Mr. Cheney as a subject.Mr. Nevins, in a telephone interview, called the genre a “huge opportunity.” Documentaries, he said, “have a lot of currency right now. For not a huge investment I can make documentaries that will make news in the world.”Mr. Nevins, who declined to give specifics, said Showtime’s documentary initiative is “a small fraction” of the network’s film budget. Individual deals, he said, follow the formula of “giving the best filmmakers just enough money to make a great film.”Showtime’s move into documentary makes sense, said Thom Powers, the documentary programmer for the Toronto International Film Festival. “I’ve always wondered why they weren’t in the space more aggressively,” he said, noting that documentaries are talked about, “even beyond who sees them.”By attracting visibility, press attention and awards, he said, documentaries are particularly valuable for channels like Showtime, which added 1 million subscribers in the last year, bringing its total to 22.3 million. “They attract the kinds of things that get that brand out in the world,” Mr. Powers said.Other cable networks are pursuing similar strategies. CNN in October announced CNN Films, which has signed development deals with the directors Alex Gibney (“Taxi to the Dark Side”) and Andrew Rossi (“Page One: Inside The New York Times”), and acquired “Girl Rising,” about a global drive to educate girls. A&E commissioned “The September Issue,” Mr. Cutler’s 2009 project, and its sister channel History is a partner in an forthcoming documentary from Errol Morris (“The Fog of War”) on the former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.There’s little chance that the pool of documentaries will be exhausted, Mr. Powers said, noting that HBO receives hundreds of submissions a month and shows only several dozen annually.Sheila Nevins (no relation), HBO’s president for documentaries, said she was not concerned about Showtime’s initiative. “I’m a very competitive person, but I do not feel competitive about this,” she said in a telephone interview. “There are more docus than there are homes. And the more homes, the better for the documentary community.”At Showtime other documentary programs in the works include a multipart series on climate change, “Years of Living Dangerously.” Showtime has also acquired other documentaries, including “Sunset Strip,” which was well received at the 2012 SXSW festival, and Marina Zenovich’s “Roman Polanski: Odd Man Out,” a follow-up to her award-winning “Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,” shown on HBO after the network acquired it at Sundance.In a telephone interview, Ms. Zenovich said she was already working with Showtime on “Richard Pryor: Omit the Logic” — with the cooperation of the comedian’s estate — when she decided to sell the network her new Polanski film. “They were really genuinely interested,” she said. “When you’re making these films, you want someone who really loves the films.”Showtime’s “Closeup” series, she said, “is a godsend to documentary filmmakers, especially me. I prefer to do profile pieces with a little more funk and grit, as opposed to issue pieces, which HBO has done a lot of.”Showtime executives will be at Sundance, and other film festivals, looking for documentary acquisitions. Mr. Cutler, who called HBO “a great friend of the documentary community,” applauded Showtime’s embrace of the genre and the money it would bring. The Cheney film, he noted, is being shown at Sundance in a documentary premiere category reserved for established filmmakers. The category, he said, reflects “the fact that there are far more career filmmakers now and that is in large part because we have these places to go for financing.”Mr. Powers noted that two other channels, Oprah Winfrey’s OWN, and Discovery, pursued similar splashy inroads in the documentary world in recent years only to pull back.“Whenever one of these channels steps forward and says that they’re going to be active in that space, I approach it with cautious optimism,” he said. “It’s great to see them supporting filmmakers, but after they’ve been in it for 20-plus years like Sheila Nevins has, then it’ll be time to give them an award.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/movies/awardsseason/jodie-foster-lifts-a-veil-at-golden-globes.html,"The answer to the puzzle of Jodie Foster’s rambling, raw, semi-confessional speech at the Golden Globes on Sunday may have been right there at the outset, when she skittishly quoted a lesser-known “Saturday Night Live” character and shouted: “I’m 50! I’m 50!”Ms. Foster’s outpouring could well have been one of those defiantly uncharacteristic steps some people take when they hit the last milestone of midlife. Like a 50-year-old who ends a marriage, takes up flying lessons, grows a beard or moves to Umbria, Ms. Foster publicly acknowledged, kind of, that she is, as anyone who cared already assumed, gay.And in doing so, Ms. Foster took an extreme bungee jump in the Hollywood Hills: a respected actress and director known for reticence, discipline and brainy self-possession defended her right to privacy in the gaudiest, noisiest, most public arena imaginable. (Sunday’s show was the highest-rated Globes ceremonies in six years, watched by nearly 20 million people.)In accepting a lifetime achievement award at the awards ceremony, Ms. Foster was eloquent, except when she went wobbly. She was revealing, except when she turned opaque. She’s a fierce nonconformist who nonetheless made herself look starlet-taut and slinky in silver and navy paillettes by Armani, and she delivered a valedictory speech without explaining what it was she is leaving.Small wonder it was confusing.Ms. Foster defended her lifelong reserve by scoffing at the celebrity-crazed culture that rewards would-be stars who expose their darkest secrets on camera, saying, “But now, apparently, I’m told that every celebrity is expected to honor the details of their private life with a news conference, a fragrance and a prime-time reality show.” In accepting her award, she spoke loftily about loyalty to friends and family, and actually practiced what she preached by pairing up at the event with Mel Gibson, who is still a Hollywood semi-pariah for his notorious anti-Semitic and homophobic rants, and even thanked him in her remarks for his support.She didn’t hide her contempt for a different kind of show business exhibitionism. “You guys might be surprised, but I am not Honey Boo Boo Child,” she said. “No, I’m sorry, that’s just not me. It never was, and it never will be.”That sounded a bit snobbish, but this actress, who began her career at the age of 3, has more reason than most to crave privacy. Ms. Foster was an inadvertent catalyst for one of the most horrifying side effects of fame — she was a freshman at Yale in 1981 when a delusional John W. Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan because he wanted to impress Jodie Foster.She didn’t mention that incident, but she seemed to allude to it when she said, “But seriously, if you had been a public figure from the time that you were a toddler, if you’d had to fight for a life that felt real and honest and normal against all odds, then maybe then you too might value privacy above all else.”Later in life Ms. Foster did not hide that she lived with a woman and that they were rearing two sons, and she certainly did not pose in fake romances with eligible bachelors. At a Women in Entertainment luncheon in 2008 she publicly thanked her partner at the time, referring to her as “my beautiful Cydney.”But even her speech on Sunday was too elliptical for many gay activists and bloggers who reacted in much the same way that several Hollywood liberals have in attacking “Zero Dark Thirty” for not emphatically denouncing torture: they were irked that Ms. Foster didn’t more clearly indicate that she was gay.Ms. Foster has not discussed her love life in interviews or made a political point of being a lesbian. At the Golden Globes, of all places, she changed her mind. Several times.“While I’m here being all confessional, I guess I just have a sudden urge to say something that I’ve never really been able to air in public,” she said. “So, a declaration that I’m a little nervous about, but maybe not quite as nervous as my publicist right now, huh, Jennifer? But you know I’m just going to put it out there, right? Loud and proud, right? So I’m going to need your support on this — I am single. Yes, I am. I am single. No, I’m kidding, but I mean I’m not really kidding, but I’m kind of kidding.”It wasn’t the most daring admission or even a complete one — she was visibly torn between a sense of duty to the gay cause and her own right to live by her own rules. It certainly wasn’t necessary. Plenty of actors with more to lose have come out of the closet of late, and gay marriage is becoming legal in a growing number of states.Mostly, it was a singular, contradictory and at times poignant unburdening by an actress who is best known for staying buttoned up."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/media/enders-game-is-a-bet-for-gigi-pritzkers-oddlot-entertainment.html,"CULVER CITY, Calif. — Back when there were only a couple of “Harry Potter” pictures, and provocative youth films like “The Hunger Games” and “Twilight” were barely a twinkle in Hollywood’s eye, Warner Brothers tried — and failed — to make a movie of Orson Scott Card’s book “Ender’s Game.”Now, Gigi Pritzker, an heiress who produces movies, is poised to expand her company atop the one that got away from Warner.The film version of “Ender’s Game” is set for release on Nov. 1 by Lionsgate’s Summit Entertainment unit. A tale of violent interplanetary warfare, it is intended to extend the young adult line of those recently merged studios, whose blockbusters, “The Hunger Games” and the “Twilight” films, have had about $4 billion in worldwide ticket sales.But “Ender’s Game” was actually built by Ms. Pritzker’s OddLot Entertainment.OddLot, founded in 2005, is tiny, with only about a dozen employees who operate from warehouse-style space near the Sony Pictures studio here. It picked up the pieces when Warner’s rights to Mr. Card’s book expired, and four years ago, it began assembling its most expensive movie to date, with a production budget of more than $110 million.Along the way, “Ender’s Game” has become part of an expansion that could soon put OddLot, though still a boutique, in Hollywood’s top flight of equity-backed production companies. Those include Participant Media, which is owned by the Web entrepreneur Jeff Skoll, and provided backing for “Lincoln”; Legendary Entertainment, which was founded by the investor Thomas Tull and is making “Man of Steel” and “Pacific Rim” for Warner; and Annapurna Pictures, which has made another heiress, Megan Ellison, a player in the current awards season, with films like “Zero Dark Thirty” and “The Master.”Successes like those, Ms. Pritzker said, suggest there is a path that can lead from small, and almost accidental, adventures in the film business to something resembling a major enterprise.“It’s only in looking back that you see, maybe there was a pattern,” Ms. Pritzker said by telephone from her home in Chicago on Wednesday. “I’m very opportunistic by nature,” she added.This week will find Ms. Pritzker at the Sundance Film Festival. She and a pair of OddLot co-presidents, Bill Lischak and Michael Nathanson, will bring with them a comedy, “The Way, Way Back,” starring Steve Carell, which is both in the festival and for sale to potential distributors.The outing will also be a test run for the new partnership between the two co-presidents. Mr. Lischak, an accountant and a former president of the independent company First Look Studios, has been with Ms. Pritzker for about six years. Mr. Nathanson, hired in November, previously served as president of MGM Pictures and production president of Sony’s Columbia Pictures unit.Mr. Nathanson, speaking jointly with Mr. Lischak in an interview last week, said he initially contacted OddLot about investing in “Ender’s Game,” which he had once hoped to buy while at MGM. Instead, he enlisted as part of the executive team at OddLot. He was drawn to the people there, he said, because they seemed refreshingly undaunted by the crosscurrents in a turbulent film business.“They’re all running into it, not away from it,” Mr. Nathanson said of OddLot’s decision to double its film count to at least three or four a year, and to dig deeper into the “Ender’s Game” business, if the movie meets its goals.A science fiction novel published in 1985, “Ender’s Game” long seemed to have disadvantages as movie material. Its violent, complicated story is built around a boy-hero with a knack for killing. And it depends on a deeply concealed twist at the end.During years of development at Warner over the last decade, Wolfgang Petersen, who planned to direct “Ender’s Game,” referred to its protagonist Andrew Wiggin, known as Ender, as a science fiction equivalent of Antoine Doinel in François Truffaut’s “400 Blows.” The depth of the lead character is something Ms. Pritzker sought to preserve as OddLot began to carve a film story from what has now become a series of books.She joined Lynn Hendee and Robert Chartoff, who were supposed to produce the film for Warner, along with Mr. Card and others. They hired Gavin Hood, the filmmaker behind both the South African teen crime drama “Tsotsi” and “X-Men Origins: Wolverine,” as writer and director. OddLot bought out the work done earlier for Warner, but Mr. Hood essentially started from scratch, ultimately creating a story that is built around a young actor, Asa Butterfield, who is 15, but is intended, like “Hunger Games,” to attract viewers well into their 30s.“I think ‘Hunger Games’ cracked the code,” Ms. Pritzker said of a shift in film culture that has since made “Ender’s Game” one of Hollywood’s most closely watched projects.Ms. Pritzker, now 50, is the daughter of the entrepreneur Jay Pritzker, who created the Hyatt hotel chain, and whose death in 1999 ultimately left Ms. Pritzker with a fortune valued by Forbes Magazine last year at $1.9 billion.Her wealth is a subject Ms. Pritzker declined to discuss last week. She explained, however, that her father was supportive when, after studying anthropology at Stanford, and then taking courses in documentary filmmaking, she joined a friend, Deborah Del Prete, to found a New York-based company that made music videos and public service advertisements, among other things.Eschewing an executive position in the family business, Ms. Pritzker went on to make movies, beginning in 1989 with a thriller, “Simple Justice,” that was directed by Ms. Del Prete.A producing partnership between the two dissolved about four years ago, Ms. Pritzker said. The separation came on the heels of a failure, “The Spirit,” which had a reported budget of about $60 million, but took in only about $20 million at the domestic box office.Ms. Del Prete was involved with the early work on “Ender’s Game,” and is an executive producer of the film. “I enjoyed a wonderful partnership and friendship with Gigi and the success of OddLot, which we co-founded,” Ms. Del Prete said in an e-mail last week.Since “The Spirit,” Ms. Pritzker said, OddLot has made money on its handful of films, which include “Rabbit Hole,” from 2010, and “Drive,” from 2011.Under Mr. Lischak and Linda McDonough, who oversees film production, the company also added bits of architecture. Those include deals with the filmmakers Robert Rodriguez (whose credits include “Machete”) and Tom McCarthy (“The Visitor”); a stake in the Sierra/Affinity foreign film sales company and another in Cinetic Media, an independent film sales and distribution company.The company’s films have touched several genres, including comedy, sports drama and, now, science fiction. Ms. Pritzker says she does not expect the movies to reflect her personal taste, but she has to find something to love in each of them.Mainly, Ms. Pritzker said, the aim has been to create a working business, rather than simply to underwrite movies from a family fortune. In putting together “Ender’s Game,” for instance, OddLot joined Digital Domain in providing about 75 percent of the budget, some of that offset by advance foreign sales, while Summit contributed the balance.In a telephone interview last week, Robert G. Friedman, co-chairman of the Lionsgate motion picture group, credited Ms. Pritzker with having spotted the potential in “Ender’s Game” at a time when most of Hollywood had given up on it.“A lot of these things sort of hide in plain sight,” Mr. Friedman said. “It takes somebody’s passion to unearth them.”It is virtually certain, he added, that Lionsgate will remain involved with OddLot.“We’re friends and partners,” he said. “And friends and partners tend to talk to each other first.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/world/middleeast/soap-operas-disappearance-adds-to-tv-drama-in-iran.html,"TEHRAN — On Sunday, as they do each week, Shahnaz and her elderly mother turned on the smuggled satellite receiver, its dish carefully hidden on the balcony, and sat back to watch their favorite soap opera, “The Tulip Age.”For months, they had happily immersed themselves in the luxe world of the square-jawed Cinar and the long-legged Yesim, whose complicated love triangles and out-of-wedlock pregnancies offer a daily distraction from real-world problems, like sanctions and a currency collapse, for millions of Iranians.But this Sunday, the characters of the Turkish series were nowhere to be found. One of Iran’s most popular satellite channels, GEM TV, operating from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, and broadcasting illegally into the country, was taken offline without explanation. Its Web site was also down, adding to the mystery.“These soaps open my heart. Who is taking them from me?” asked Shahnaz, 52, a homemaker who did not want her last name used. “Dirt on their heads,” her 84-year-old mother cursed in Persian, to no one in particular.On Monday, with the Iranian news media silent, wild rumors flew about the causes of the blackout, with some describing a technically complicated government crackdown and others a shrewd plot to get people to subscribe online for a monthly fee.“First, they made us addicted, and now, they are trying to get money out of us,” said the doorman of a building in West Tehran.“They must be changing their transmission frequencies,” suggested a satellite dish engineer, who has been installing illegal sets for years. “The advertisements, the viewers — think of the money involved. No way this channel will stop.”Most people, though, saw the hand of the government. The authorities here have fought what they call a “cultural invasion” from the West, starting with the introduction of videotaped Hollywood movies in the 1980s and, more recently, the Internet and dozens of satellite channels based abroad, broadcasting in Persian.Millions of Iranians in possession of illegal satellite equipment smuggled into the country and sold for less than $150 can watch an array of news programs, political talk shows and sometimes raunchy soaps. On Monday, another popular channel, Manoto, operating out of London, broadcast the Golden Globes.Needless to say, none of these would appear on Iran’s state television, whether as a matter of taste or politics. Police officers regularly rip satellite dishes from rooftops, and clerics warn of the corrupting effects of non-Iranian programs on children and families.“At the beginning of the school year, our head teacher told us to give our students extra homework so they wouldn’t spend their evenings in front of satellite channels,” said Somaye, a teacher at an elementary school.Satellite channels began to gain in popularity about a decade ago. It was about then that an Iranian opposition politician in California started receiving, during his long rants against Iran’s leaders, phone calls from viewers in Iran who were picking up his station’s signal through a Turkish satellite.There has been a boom in channels ever since. Voice of America has a service in Persian, as does the BBC. But news and political talk shows are quickly losing out to channels that bring Persian-language entertainment, especially Turkish soap operas. New programs include a talent show hosted by one of Iran’s most prominent singers, Googoosh, and Iranian dance competitions taped in Georgia. There are movie channels in Persian, shopping channels, even religious channels.Several politicians have called upon state television to develop programming to win back the viewers they are losing to satellite channels. But few viewers, having been exposed to Western entertainment programs, want to switch back.“On the satellite channels, I watch ‘America’s Got Talent’ dubbed in Persian, while at the same time, our state television is showing an hourlong program on mathematics. Which one would you prefer?” asked Hamid-Reza Mohammadi, 30, an insurance salesman.There are indications that GEM TV has closer ties with the Iran government than do other satellite channels based abroad. On Dec. 16, the semiofficial Tabnak Web site reported the arrest in Tehran of several people doing Persian voice-overs for the channel’s other hit series, “The Sultan’s Harem,” another originally Turkish production popular in the Middle East.Two weeks after those arrests, the Persian voice of the actor playing the lead role of Sultan Suleyman suddenly changed from a booming bass to a higher, almost squeaky voice. Other characters sounded nasal, as though they were pinching their noses to change their voices.The changes first prompted laughter, but that quickly turned to disappointment after the series was taken off the air by the channel itself.On GEM TV’s Web site, which was up again on Monday, a contact page showed offices in Toronto, London and Dubai. An employee who spoke Persian but refused to give his name said that “all problems” would be solved soon and that he could give no further information on how long the channel might be off the air.For Shahnaz, the question now was how to fill the long evenings with her mother. She tried a European music channel, where scantily clad models were dancing in a library to the beat of a song called “Raise the Roof.” She quickly changed the channel before her mother could notice.“There is nothing on tonight,” Shahnaz told her. “Let’s go to sleep.”"

(Sundance) CAREER GIRLS (1997) Two former college roommates — Hannah (Katrin Cartlidge) and Annie (Lynda Steadman, above left, with Ms. Cartlidge) — once locked in constant battle try to re-establish their relationship over a weekend in this Mike Leigh drama. Joe Tucker plays Adrian, a smug real estate agent selling a flat who barely remembers the time he once lounged around their druggy lair and broke their hearts. “With his usual deep, engrossing attention to behavioral detail, Mr. Leigh uses ‘Career Girls’ to visit and fuse these contrasting chapters into a continuum of the women’s lives,” Janet Maslin wrote in The New York Times. “Over the course of their brief reunion, Hannah and Annie reveal the present while they talk about the past, and the film explodes with jittery, hand-held flashbacks to match their buried emotions.” The movie, she added, “doesn’t impose any false closure on its wistful portraits, nor does it contrive more than a few strained coincidences (like Adrian’s reappearance) to create a conventional story.”5:40 P.M. (Starz) CARNAGE (2011) A meeting between two sets of parents — played by Jodie Foster, John C. Reilly, Kate Winslet and Christoph Waltz — to discuss a playground scuffle between their sons degenerates into a vitriolic verbal sparring match in this adaptation of Yasmina Reza’s play, directed by Roman Polanski. “The spectator, gliding and feinting around the edges of the room with Mr. Polanski’s nimble camera, anticipates violence and perhaps hopes for it to erupt,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “All of the actors conduct themselves skillfully — hitting their marks and tearing through the sometimes awkward idioms of a translated script — without being entirely convincing.”6:15 P.M. (Showtime) THE OTHERS (2001) Nicole Kidman, below, stars in Alejandro Amenábar’s ghost story about a woman living an almost ascetic existence with her two ailing children (James Bentley and Alakina Mann) on an island in the English Channel toward the end of World War II. Then a group of servants (Fionnula Flanagan, Eric Sykes and Elaine Cassidy) arrives and breaks all her rules. “Ms. Kidman embodies this unstable amalgam with a conviction that is in itself terrifying,” A. O. Scott wrote in The Times. “The icy reserve that sometimes stands in the way of her expressive gifts here becomes the foundation of her most emotionally layered performance to date.”8 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/15/business/media/coke-tv-ads-confront-obesity-and-sodas-role.html,"The Coca-Cola Company began a new television ad campaign Monday aimed at getting on the healthy side of the national debate over obesity — a novel step for a company built on sugary soft drinks.“We’d like people to come together on something that concerns all of us, obesity,” began the two-minute ad, which is scheduled to run during prime-time cable news shows. “The long-term health of our families and our country is at stake, and as the nation’s leading beverage company, we can play an important role.”The ad goes on to promote steps Coke has taken, like putting calorie counts on “the front” of its cans and other packaging and increasing the number of its brands sold in smaller cans, to help consumers make healthier choices.“There’s a really important conversation going on out there about obesity, and we want to be a part of it because our consumer is telling us they want us to be a part of it,” said Stuart Kronauge, general manager for sparkling beverages at Coca-Cola North America.This ad is aimed at policy makers, but a second ad, to be broadcast Wednesday during the first episode of the new season for “American Idol,” will focus on consumers, emphasizing the calories in a can of soda and offering ideas about how to work them off, like walking the dog for 25 minutes, doing a victory dance or even laughing.The ads establish a link between the company and its products and obesity, which could be risky. “We thought about that, but we’ve learned that consumers love more information from us — and we really believe Coke has the power to connect people in a way that can help solve issues,” Ms. Kronauge said.It is the first time the company has gone on the offensive to tackle widespread criticism that sugary sodas are one of the biggest contributors to the obesity epidemic, and the ads drew criticism even before they were shown.“This is not about changing the products but about confusing the public,” said Michele R. Simon, a public health lawyer who writes frequently about the food and beverage business and its role in public health issues on her blog, Appetite for Profit. “They are downplaying the serious health effects of drinking too much soda and making it sound like balancing soda consumption with exercise is the only issue, when there are plenty of other reasons not to consume too much of these kinds of products.”Ms. Simon dismissed the ads as pure public relations and noted that the industry faced an onslaught of public health efforts to curb consumption of sugary sodas, like efforts around the country to impose taxes on high-sugar drinks and Mayor Michael Bloomberg’s move to restrict the sizes of sodas sold in movie theaters and other spots in New York City.The American Beverage Association, the organization that represents the industry, has filed a lawsuit against New York City and has fought successfully so far to defeat soda tax initiatives. Sales of carbonated sodas in general and sugary sodas in particular continue to slide, however, as consumers choose water, juices and other alternatives.“They are clearly running scared and for good reason,” said Harold Goldstein, executive director of the California Center for Public Health Advocacy, which led the charge to get sugary sodas out of schools.Dr. Goldstein said that if Coke really wanted to do something to reduce consumption of sugary sodas, it would sell them for a higher price than its other low- and no-calorie beverages. “Instead of spending millions on a P.R. campaign that will do nothing to combat obesity, diabetes and tooth decay, they would reap profits and change the beverage consumption of Americans in a big and beneficial way,” he said.John Sicher, publisher of Beverage Digest and a longtime observer of the industry, said he thought soda companies had for too long avoided the issue of obesity as criticism mounted. “Letting the industry’s adversaries define it isn’t smart or in its self-interest,” he said."

Naseeruddin Shah plays the father determined to pull off a wedding he cannot afford. Vijay Raaz is the wedding planner, who nervously eats marigolds. “ ‘Wedding’ often has the energy of a Bollywood spectacle, with its ingratiatingly incongruous shuffles of genres; we even get a handful of musical numbers, including a warm, offhanded song on the pleasures of married life performed by a group of women,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The New York Times. “The agile handling of the soap opera elements — conventional plotting at best — finally makes ‘Wedding’ a pop, facile take on Capulet versus Montague stuff, likable but square.” He added: “Like the monsoon rains that temper Delhi’s summer heat, this movie offers subtle surprises.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/business/economy/retail-sales-improve-producer-prices-fall.html,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) — Retail sales rose more than expected in December, the Commerce Department said on Tuesday, as Americans shrugged off the threat of higher taxes and bought automobiles and a variety of other goods.The government said retail sales rose 0.5 percent last month, compared with a 0.4 percent increase, after revisions, in November. Sales in November were previously reported to have gained 0.3 percent.Economists polled by Reuters had expected sales to rise only 0.2 percent. Sales were up 4.7 percent from December 2011 and up 5.2 percent for the whole of 2012, suggesting momentum in consumer spending as the year ended.So-called core sales, which excludes automobiles, gasoline and building materials and corresponds most closely with the consumer spending component of gross domestic product, increased 0.6 percent after gaining 0.5 percent in November.The second consecutive month of gains in core sales suggested that consumer spending picked up in the fourth quarter after rising at an annual pace of 1.6 percent in the July-through-September period.The government also said on Tuesday that producer prices fell in December for the third consecutive month as food prices declined by the most in a year and a half.The Labor Department said its seasonally adjusted Producer Price Index slipped 0.2 percent last month. Economists polled by Reuters had expected prices at farms, factories and refineries to drop 0.1 percent.A 0.9 percent drop in food costs drove most of the December decline. Excluding volatile food and energy costs, wholesale prices rose 0.1 percent, which was in line with analysts’ forecasts.The core reading suggested that businesses were seeing little growth in price pressures. It could reinforce the outlook that modest inflation would give the Federal Reserve space to continue with easy-money policies aimed at propping up the economy.The decline in overall prices brought 12-month inflation to 1.3 percent.The Commerce Department also said business inventories rose modestly in November as sales increased solidly, indicating that a buildup in inventories would not add much to economic growth in the fourth quarter.Inventories increased 0.3 percent, to a record $1.62 trillion, after rising by the same margin in October.The gain in November was in line with economists’ expectations. Automobile inventories rose 0.5 percent after increasing 0.8 percent in October."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/arts/music/elliott-carter-memorial-at-le-poisson-rouge.html,"In an inspired gesture, a group of exemplary musicians presented a memorial concert for the composer Elliott Carter on Sunday night not at a prestigious performing arts center but at Le Poisson Rouge, the lively, informal Greenwich Village club that caters to all kinds of contemporary music. Carter died in November, a month shy of his 104th birthday, and he was composing and collaborating with performers almost to the end.As the cellist Fred Sherry — one of Carter’s closest colleagues, who had organized the composer’s 103rd-birthday concert at the 92nd Street Y in 2011 — told the Poisson Rouge audience before the final performance of the evening, Carter was a longtime Greenwich Village resident who could tell you all about alleys and buildings that no longer existed.Also, for all the trademark complexity of Carter’s compositional voice, his music embraced wide-ranging styles and influences, which made a Carter program especially suitable for a club bent on breaking down boundaries.“So,” Mr. Sherry said, “if you hear Bach when you listen to Carter’s music, you are correct. If you hear jazz, you are correct. In fact, whatever you hear, you are correct.”The club was packed. Understandably, since so many of Carter’s friends and colleagues were there, the concertgoers seated at the crammed tables were a little older than those who typically frequent Le Poisson Rouge. But lots of younger listeners were among the standees.The all-Carter program opened with “Con Leggerezza Pensosa: Omaggio a Italo Calvino,” composed in 1990, a trio for clarinet (the elegant Charlie Neidich), violin (the brilliant Rolf Schulte) and cello (Mr. Sherry). The piece shifts between stretches of quizzical sustained sonorities and impish outbursts. Mr. Sherry had the audience riveted during “Figment” (1994) for solo cello, an impetuous, episodic fantasy that somehow comes across as an inexorable dramatic entity.A highlight of the program was “Tempo e Tempos,” a 15-minute song cycle composed in 1998 and 1999 as a “small gesture of gratitude to Italian culture and its musicians that have shown such an interest in my work,” to quote Carter.The text comes from poems by Eugenio Montale, Salvatore Quasimodo and Giuseppe Ungaretti. The vocal writing for soprano has skittish leaps and darting riffs characteristic of Carter’s style. Yet there are long stretches of pliant, lyrical Italianate melodic lines, sung with melting beauty by the impressive soprano Tony Arnold, who also easily navigated every vocal leap with uncanny precision.The ensemble, with Mr. Schulte, Mr. Neidich, Mr. Sherry and the oboist Steve Taylor, was conducted by Michael Nicolas.Mr. Schulte and Mr. Sherry excelled in Carter’s Duettino (2008); Mr. Schulte gave an incandescent account of the Fantasy for Solo Violin (1999); and Mr. Neidich conveyed the invention and exuberance of “Gra” (1993) for solo clarinet.Finally, the dazzling pianist Ursula Oppens, who has recorded all of Carter’s piano works and played them on tour during the year of his 100th birthday, was joined by Ensemble LPR, a young string quartet from the house band at Le Poisson Rouge, for a performance of Carter’s 1997 Quintet.In his comments Mr. Sherry shared another Carter story. When asked in an interview about his artistic credo, Carter, who did not like talking about such things, suggested that his music was like an ideal of American democracy, with “dissenting independent voices creating harmony.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/sports/tennis/16iht-atp16.html,"MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA — Brad Drewett, executive chairman and president of the ATP Tour, announced on Tuesday that he had been diagnosed with A.L.S. — also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease — and would resign from his post after little more than a year in the position.“I hold the ATP very close to my heart, and it’s with sadness that I make the decision to enter this transition period due to my ill health,” Drewett, 54, said in a statement.The news came as a surprise in the tennis community, leaving some in tears in the Australian Open players’ lounge, and also in the meeting room where Drewett announced his decision to members of the ATP board of directors in the morning.“He read a release, and it was very, very emotional,” said Justin Gimelstob, an American former player who is on the board.The search for Drewett’s eventual replacement will now begin.Drewett, an Australian, was a compromise candidate as the leader of the men’s tour. He was offered the post after considerable infighting on the board and disagreement among the game’s leading players, including Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal.But he has deep experience in the game and its administration.He played professionally, reaching the quarterfinals of the 1976 Australian Open, and has served in numerous key positions for the men’s tour. He played a particularly prominent role in promoting and developing the men’s game in Asia as the ATP’s regional director. He was also instrumental in taking the season-ending championship, then known as the Tennis Masters Cup, to Shanghai and served as the tournament director both there and when it moved to London.But the ATP chairmanship was his dream job, and he took the post at a time of increased tension between the players and the leaders of the Grand Slam tournaments over demands for increased prize money.Engaging in face-to-face meetings, he and the players have made progress, securing significant increases in pay from the Australian Open and the United States Open, although Drewett and some players have expressed dissatisfaction with the figures at the United States Open.“We had numerous meetings with him, with the Grand Slams — chatted to him a lot privately as well,” said Andy Murray, the world’s third-ranked player. “It’s obviously very shocking news, very sad. You know, he’s done a very good job for the tour. He’s done a good job of bringing the tournaments together and arranging, you know, the meetings we had with the Slams. He’s definitely had an impact in the time he’s been working there.”Drewett has been constrained by unresolved problems with his vocal chords, which often left his voice a hoarse whisper and forced him to consider surgery to address the problem. But he plans to step aside from his post soon and focus on his health. Gimelstob said Drewett had informed some of the top players, including Federer and Nadal, directly before announcing his decision.“I felt sick when the news came out today,” said Darren Cahill, the Australian coach and analyst who has long been a friend of Drewett’s.“Everyone knows he’s been struggling with the voice for the last year and a half, and he just couldn’t get to the bottom of it,” Cahill said. “So we all, in the back of our minds, were kind of thinking: ‘Is it something more than that?’ But he always said, ‘It’s going to get better, it’s getting better.’“Sometimes the worst things happen to the best people. We don’t know why, but he’s always been a great friend to us and always will be, and our love and support goes to him and his family and his three kids.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/dining/blood-oranges-add-color-to-dishes-and-desserts.html,"THE last bottle of holiday wine has been drunk, the discarded Christmas trees have been pulped to mulch and my local farmers’ market has shrunk to a few crates of muddy roots and yellowing kale. It’s time to celebrate something new: the arrival of blood oranges.Citrus season is in full swing, with tangerines, pomelos and Meyer lemons at their most fragrant and alluring. But none have the festive flair of the crimson-fleshed blood orange. And with more growers planting the somewhat finicky fruit, they are fast becoming nearly as easy to find as clementines — at least from now until April.Blood oranges were the result of a spontaneous mutation of the sweet orange. The color develops when the fruit is grown in climates with cold nights and warm, sun-filled afternoons.In Italy, blood oranges are the most popular kind of table oranges. Order a glass of orange juice in Rome and chances are you’ll be served something ruby-hued. The best blood oranges there are rooted in the rich volcanic soil near Mount Etna in Sicily, though they can also grow in other parts of the Mediterranean. In the United States, most are grown in California’s Central Valley, though Arizona and Texas cultivate the fruit as well. And you occasionally see blood oranges imported from Sicily; they tend to be juicer than their American cousins.There are three main varieties: Italians swear by the variegated blond and scarlet Tarocco, which has a sweet, berrylike flavor and soft, easy-to-peel skin. Taroccos’ red pigment deepens as they reach maturity, which in Italy happens around Valentine’s Day.Taroccos do not have a blush on their skins, which makes them a harder sell in the United States, said Celso Paganini, a partner in Porto Pavino, an Italian culinary importing company. Not so the Moro, whose striking, crimson flesh bleeds onto their skin as they mature. In Italy, tart Moros are mostly used for juice. But here in the States, the vibrant color has made them a favorite of chefs and mixologists alike.Finally there’s the thin-skinned Sanguinello, a full-blood variety (similar to the Moro) that isn’t often seen here.If you have a choice when you’re shopping, choose the Moro for looks and the Tarocco for flavor. Either way, pick fruit that is heavy for its size, an indicator that it’s full of juice (a good tip for any type of citrus).You can eat blood oranges out of hand like navels. Or toss them into a simple winter salad dressed with olive oil and flaky salt. Mr. Paganini recommends peeling the fruit, then slicing them crosswise — “like salami,” he said — and dressing with a few drops of good balsamic and a shower of chopped fennel fronds. A few slivers of sweet onion won’t hurt, either. Or mix blood and regular oranges for a pretty salad that helps banish the winter blahs.Recently, I tossed blood orange segments into a salad of roasted carrots, salty olives and freshly ground spices, which was refreshing, satisfying and stunning with its sunset colors.Because of their acidity, blood oranges are also excellent with fish. I mixed slices with lime and stuffed them into whole fish, seasoned with fennel and garlic.And although in Italy a blood orange is often served for dessert all by its lonesome, I sugar things up by making them into an upside-down cake spiked with cornmeal. It’s about as festive as a fruit dessert can get, especially in the cold days of a long winter."

In a career of many books and articles, I have never before received such a comment. The mere suggestion is disturbing to me, a Jew from North Carolina who, as a boy, had a cross burned on his lawn.Adding to a string of out-of-context quotes, Ms. Maslin continues to pour fuel on a prejudicial pyre by citing my description of “Chariots of Fire” as “a film about a Jewish runner.” She does me and prospective readers a disservice, though, by again omitting the context, a description of Mohamed al-Fayed’s displeasure with the Hollywood dabblings of his son Dodi, who received an executive producer credit on the Oscar-winning film.I was demonstrating how the magic of movies attracts the strangest bedfellows to finance films.WILLIAM STADIEMSanta Monica, Calif., Jan. 14, 2013"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/dining/vongerichtens-raising-their-daughters-interest-in-food.html,"CHLOE VONGERICHTEN, 12, is the horseback riding, hip-hop dancing, trapeze swinging daughter of Jean-Georges Vongerichten, 55, and his wife, Marja, 36. He has eight restaurants in New York, including the one bearing his name at 1 Central Park West, and 27 more around the world. She was the host of “Kimchi Chronicles,” a food and travelogue show that ran for 13 episodes on PBS beginning in 2011, and is the author of the accompanying cookbook. The question arises: Is an obsession with food a genetic trait? And if so, does Chloe have it?“We are resigned to the fact that our daughter is not a true foodie,” Ms. Vongerichten said, adding, “For a while, she only ate white food: yogurt, pasta and rice.”Chloe is far less picky now, eating a half-American, half-Korean diet, and many colors other than white. She particularly likes her father’s pizza, chicken fingers and French fries. When she cooks with him on weekends at their home in Westchester County, they make Marion Cunningham’s buttermilk pancakes, which “are the best pancakes in the world,” Mr. Vongerichten said.“The proportion of the flour, the baking soda — they’re light; they’re fluffy,” he said.If weekends are Chloe’s cooking dates with her father, weekday dinners are more often spent with her mother, because he is at any one of his Manhattan restaurants. Some nights, mother and daughter order in from Bleecker Street Pizza, near their apartment in Greenwich Village. Or they might order soba from En Brasserie on Hudson Street.Other nights, Ms. Vongerichten cooks for Chloe. “I don’t cook every single day,” Ms. Vongerichten said. “When I really cook, a lot of weekends in the country, I invite people over.”One night, she made one of her daughter’s favorites, Korean rice cake soup in a beef broth. “It tastes of comfort, and it’s good and it feels healthy,” Chloe said. “I love the chewiness of the noodle.”Ms. Vongerichten then moved on to Korean mung bean pancakes, more for herself than for Chloe.“I love it,” Ms. Vongerichten said of the vegetarian dish. “It tastes like a potato latke. You can add shredded Cheddar cheese instead of kimchi. You can add bean sprouts.” She makes them twice a month, and fries them until they are very crisp.When she asked her daughter to mix the dipping sauce, she handed her a bottle of Chung Jung Won soy sauce, a Korean brand. “Taste it,” Ms. Vongerichten urged, describing it as having a sweeter, more caramel-like flavor and texture, as well as a stronger wine flavor than Chinese or Japanese soy sauce.When the pancakes were ready, Chloe nibbled on one, but with no particular gusto. As her father said, “She’s not a foodie, yet.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/nyregion/chess-in-a-harlem-park-moves-indoors-for-winter.html,"On a cold evening, darkness enveloped a lonely street in Harlem, but for the glow of fluorescent lights cascading from a storefront. Inside, there were sounds reminiscent of combat. Hands slammed on time clocks in a vigorous percussion, accompanied by the taunts of opponents:“This is masters’ chess.”“Master that.”“Don’t you run from me!”“I ain’t scared!”“You can’t get out of there.”“Watch this.”The games being played had been honed by years of chess matches at St. Nicholas Park, near 141st Street, where regulars, hustlers and occasional visitors played for hours on end, drawing crowds and creating street chess legends.But with winter’s arrival, the games moved inside, to the St. Nicholas Chess and Backgammon Club, on the corner of 139th Street and Edgecombe Avenue in Harlem. It is a place where the art of the hustle can get lost amid the players’ familiarity with one another.“We eat together, we party together, pray together,” a regular named Two Hand Dave said. Like most who frequent the club, he is known only by his nickname, particularly to outsiders. Two Hand Dave, 41, got his name because of his style of play, but also to distinguish him from players known simply as Dave and Big Dave.Two Hand Dave had lost several matches to a gray-haired chess veteran, Charlie Harris, who then challenged an old friend.At another table, less than a minute remained on the clock. In the last stand — Next move, smack! Countermove, smack! — a queen is hopelessly trapped.The loser, known in the club as Easy E, slid back from his chair and asked someone up front to hand him the Chinese takeout food he had ordered, growing cold on a backgammon table.“You done beat the man into hungriness,” Fred, a regular wearing a hunter’s hat, shouted over the battlefield of arrested chess pieces. A few spectators chuckled. Easy E, a 49-year-old transportation engineer, sulked away, but vowed to return. The victor, a petite woman nicknamed Mousae, with her hair wrapped in a black-and-gold colored scarf, now a crown of glory, grinned and offered some words of wisdom: “You can’t win the game with a pawn.”Chess games here are played over three, sometimes five minutes. Veterans will spot those who want to learn.While the game pieces flew, J.B., the manager of the club and mayor of the old park crew, leaned back in a chair stationed by the door. With his hands resting on his belly, and a head of gray stubble, he resembled Buddha, a backgammon player joked, prompting a chorus of laughter. J.B. and some of the old-timers gazed up at the television for a “Mission: Impossible” episode. Before long a debate ensued — which character did the actor Leonard Nimoy play first: Paris, the I.M.F. agent, or Mr. Spock? (The half-Vulcan eventually wins.)The club actually began, unofficially, more than two decades ago in the apartment of one of the players. When summer came, the players migrated to St. Nicholas Park. Before long, “masters were coming every day,” J.B. said in a gravelly voice. “It became one big park for all the strong chess players to go.”With their chessboards and time clocks, the crew took over a patch of the park by 141st Street from the purse-snatchers, holdup artists and addicts who smoked crack in the park restroom. The camaraderie mimicked a festive family reunion. J.B. sold sodas from a cooler that he pushed from his nearby apartment. Someone grilled burgers and franks, while R&B and hip-hop thumped from a boom box. At times, the games lasted until dawn. But when winter came, the group, which over the years had swelled to some 300, scattered.David Smith, the club owner, found them all a permanent home; the storefront, formerly a barbershop and a 99-cent store, has been leased now for a little over two years. The players have everything they need for the winter: heat, takeout menus, a coffee and tea machine and a minifridge. For the sticky summer, Mr. Smith even put in a central air system, although he knows that before long the park will beckon.“There’s a freedom there,” Mr. Smith, 44, said. “There’s nothing like being outdoors, playing chess and talking garbage as loud as you want.”For now, people steadily strolled in, each of them greeted with shouts.“Vito!” someone said. “You must be on work-release,” another player joked.Regulars include chess and backgammon hustlers as well as Wall Street brokers, Mr. Smith said. In skill, he said, they range from a fish, or easy target, to a master. The masters here are not officially ranked. They simply dominate.The club rules are posted near the front door, under the security camera monitor. The police sometimes look at the tapes when outside trouble disrupts the neighborhood. Monthly dues are $50. However, most players, to Mr. Smith’s chagrin, opt to pay the daily rate, $5 a day for chess, $3 an hour for backgammon. The club is open seven days a week. Games begin at noon, and are known to go long past midnight, when the club closes. When the phone rings, it is sometimes someone’s wife calling.“I don’t even know what keeps us up,” said Harold Carr, 62, a retired teacher. “Chess does that to you.”Before long, J.B. was roused. Fred had challenged him to a match.“Woooo,” yelled a player everyone called Black, 53, a former real estate broker, who inched up to the table as if he had a front-row seat to a heavyweight prizefight.“These guys been playing 30, 40 years,” Black said, rubbing his hands together as J.B. settled across from his opponent. “They know everything. They know all the tricks.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/arts/2013-nea-jazz-masters-are-honored.html,"Eddie Palmieri was eager to share the glory when he accepted his 2013 National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters award, at Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola on Monday night. Taking the podium, he recalled the first time he heard his fellow pianist McCoy Tyner, at Birdland in the mid-1960s with the John Coltrane Quartet. Mr. Palmieri, whose band was then in residence just up the block at the Palladium Ballroom, described being transfixed.“In that moment, I said I’ve never seen or heard anyone play like Mr. McCoy Tyner,” he said. Then, fixing his eyes on Mr. Tyner, seated at a nearby table: “I love you very much. You are truly, truly the greatest pianist I’ve ever seen onstage.” The subject of this encomium was visibly moved, and there were more expressions of mutual admiration before Mr. Palmieri approached the piano to deliver an expressive dramatic monologue.The National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Masters Fellowship, bestowed each year since 1982, is a singular honor with firm communal purpose. A $25,000 grant goes to each of its recipients. There are four this year: Mr. Palmieri, 76; the singer, songwriter and pianist Mose Allison, 85; the alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson, 86; and the club owner Lorraine Gordon, 90 — but the greater joy seems to reside in the sense of validation and belonging that the award confers.That’s usually true, but it felt truer this year, during an event staged as an intimate, black-tie dinner rather than a free concert open to the public. (It’s still produced in partnership with Jazz at Lincoln Center, but at the organization’s house nightclub instead of its main concert hall.) Call this a downsizing, if you like, but the ceremony and concert were also more media-accessible than ever, broadcast on SiriusXM, WBGO 88.3 FM and online at arts.gov/jazzmasterswebcast, where they can still be viewed.The atmosphere was collegial, bordering on clubby, which made sense in a room stocked with nearly two dozen past honorees, some enlisted as presenters or performers. “Man, this is a heavy audience,” Sheila Jordan, who joined the ranks last year, said just before singing her gracious jazz-life testimonial, “Sheila’s Blues.” Swinging impeccably behind her were the pianist Kenny Barron, the bassist Ron Carter and the drummer Jimmy Cobb — “a house band to end all house bands,” in the words of Wynton Marsalis, one of the hosts (and a 2011 Jazz Master himself).Mr. Donaldson, a virtuoso ham, began his remarks complainingly: “I was wondering” — he waited a beat — “why it took so long,” and moved on to an elaborate comic riff about old age and the paramount importance of erectile-dysfunction drugs. His musical contribution was also sly, though a little more serious: he played “Blues Walk,” one of his enduring hard-bop tunes, with a taut, honking ease.Another quartet performance — “Sweet Lorraine,” featuring the tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath in mellow, articulate form — was dedicated to Ms. Gordon, the steadfast proprietor of the Village Vanguard. Her health had prevented her from attending, so the award was accepted by her daughter Deborah Gordon, who said Ms. Gordon had “expressed how lucky she feels to be part of this community.”One impression the endowment’s Jazz Masters ceremony often leaves is that jazz now represents a living language but a dwindling culture. That’s up for debate, as it should be. But there’s no doubting the poignancy of a ritual largely devoted to artists who came of age more than half a century ago; at one point the pianist Randy Weston paid musical tribute to three who died last year, including Von Freeman, John Levy and  Dave Brubeck.And in his portion of the program, Mr. Allison said little except in song, playing “Was,” an original parlor waltz featuring his daughter, Amy Allison, on vocals. It’s a meditation on mortality, infused with more curiosity than self-pity; it suggests that the afterlife has a lot to do with the simple matter of being remembered."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/us/politics/obama-presses-senate-to-confirm-atf-director.html,"WASHINGTON — President Obama indicated on Wednesday that along with asking Congress to pass measures like an assault weapons ban, he would be increasing pressure on lawmakers to do something they have refused to do for the past six years: confirm a permanent director of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.At a news conference, the president unveiled a series of executive actions and legislative proposals to help reduce gun violence, and he said he would nominate the agency’s acting director, B. Todd Jones, to be its permanent leader.“Congress needs to help, rather than hinder, law enforcement as it does its job,” Mr. Obama said on Wednesday.Mr. Jones, 55, a former Marine who is also the United States attorney in Minnesota, has led the beleaguered agency since August 2011, when he was appointed by the administration to take over in the aftermath of the scandal surrounding the bungled gun trafficking investigation known as Operation Fast and Furious, in which agents lost track of firearms they were allowing to pass into Mexico.Until 2006, the president had the power to install a director of the firearms bureau without Congressional approval. But under pressure from gun lobbyists, Congress changed the law that year to require Senate confirmation. Since then, the Senate has failed to confirm any nominee by either President George W. Bush or Mr. Obama as senators who support gun rights have used their powers to delay nomination votes; Mr. Jones is the bureau’s fifth acting director since 2006.One of the more vocal critics of the Justice Department and the firearms agency, Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said Wednesday that he agreed with the president that it was time for the Senate to confirm a permanent director of the agency, but he raised questions about Mr. Jones’s credibility.“The new nominee, B. Todd Jones, is a familiar face to the committee, but his ties to the Fast and Furious scandal raise serious questions,” Mr. Grassley said.“In any case, he’ll receive a thorough and fair vetting by the Judiciary Committee,” said Mr. Grassley, the committee’s senior Republican.For years, the A.T.F. has been battered by scandals and has had its authority undercut by gun lobbyists, who have pushed to limit its power and cut its funding. The bureau most recently came under scrutiny in 2011 for its handling of Fast and Furious after; two of the firearms used in the investigation were found at the scene of a shootout in which a United States Border Patrol agent was killed in Arizona.Mr. Jones said in a meeting with reporters in September that during his tenure the agency had refocused its efforts on fighting violent crime and was “recalibrating” how it did business by revamping its policies and procedures.“We are well on our way to tightening up our unity of effort and our communications,” Mr. Jones said, adding that senior officials in Washington now had more oversight over the agency’s field offices.Mr. Jones said that some procedures had not been updated in 15 to 20 years.“We are back to the basics, and that is what I have been working very hard at, the fundamentals,” he said, “and the fundamentals for us is protecting the American public from violent crime.”Mr. Jones has told the agency’s offices to work closely with police departments in large cities to combat sudden increases in crime and “to focus on cases that will have the greatest impact,” a senior agency official said in a recent interview.This year, A.T.F. agents have been part of so-called surges of law enforcement officers in the country’s most violent cities, including Oakland, Calif., and Philadelphia, working to make arrests and seize guns."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/movies/awardsseason/ben-affleck-now-an-underdog-with-argo-is-on-the-rebound.html,"Ben Affleck said to ask him anything. “Nothing is off limits,” he said, adding later, “There’s nothing that you can ask me that hasn’t been asked of me before.”Not true. One thing that Mr. Affleck has only recently had to answer for is how it feels to be snubbed by the Oscars. As the director, producer and star of “Argo” he was considered a shoo-in for a best director nomination, typically crucial in any campaign for a best picture prize. But last week the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences overlooked Mr. Affleck the filmmaker, though his movie earned other nominations, including best picture.By Sunday, when he won two Golden Globes, for directing and producing (along with George Clooney and Grant Heslov), he had a line ready about the snub.“We got nominated for seven Oscars, including best picture,” he said backstage. “If you can’t be happy with that, your prospects for long-term happiness are pretty sad.”All along “Argo” had seemed in step with the awards machinery. In August it was shown at the Telluride Film Festival, where “The King’s Speech” had earned the attention of critics, and in September its premiere drew a standing ovation at the Toronto International Film Festival, just like the future Oscar winner “Slumdog Millionaire.” And as he has made the promotional rounds Mr. Affleck has sounded confident and informed, in his filmmaking and political history at least. What he was not prepared for was going from early front-runner to late-season underdog. But underdog, as veteran Oscar watchers know, is the pole position to be in for the race.Though only three films have won best picture without a corresponding best director nomination — “Driving Miss Daisy,” in 1989, was the latest — Mr. Affleck’s fortunes, at least judging by the good will that attended his Globes victory, seem to be on the rebound. And it’s not as if he’s unfamiliar with having to rebound.“I was nobody auditioning, and then I was seen as this young, emerging talent, writer, Oscar winner” — for the “Good Will Hunting” screenplay — “and then I was seen as this blockbuster actor, and then I was seen as this kind of train-wreck actor” (insert your own “Gigli” joke here) “and then I was seen as this resurgent director,” he said in a recent interview in New York. “And now I think I’m kind of seen as just sort of somebody in Hollywood who works.”“Argo,” the true story of how the C.I.A. operative Tony Mendez (Mr. Affleck) used a fake sci-fi flick as cover for his rescue of six American diplomats trapped in Tehran during the 1970s hostage crisis, appealed to him because it played out on a broader scale than his first two hometown directorial efforts, “Gone Baby Gone” and “The Town.” “I didn’t want to just keep doing movies in Boston,” he said. (Bostonites, hold your fire: Mr. Affleck plans to return for an adaptation of “Live by Night” by Dennis Lehane, who also wrote the novel “Gone Baby Gone.”)Mr. Affleck’s own performance was inspired by the implacable, reserved Mr. Mendez, a former Master of Disguise.“I met him at this sort of famous C.I.A. hangout bar, and I thought I’d find all of these interesting hooks to use to play the character,” Mr. Affleck said. “Instead I found this very sort of withdrawn, kind of opaque guy, and I sort of panicked.” But he decided to protect the reality and subvert the usual conventions of hard-charging, heroic protagonists. “I’d rather have a guy whose instinct is to fade into the background,” he said, “who is asked to stick his neck out to save these six people.”Mr. Mendez, now retired and on the circuit promoting the film, based in part on his autobiography, joined the interview, praising Mr. Affleck for his attention to detail and veracity. He had even offered Mr. Affleck some of his own 1970s clothing to wear, sport coats and polyester prints.“There was a green turtleneck, which I drew the line at,” Mr. Affleck said.“That was my main shirt,” Mr. Mendez said. “For an Irish filmmaker you got to have a green turtleneck.”Mr. Affleck: “Don’t admit that to people.”Mr. Mendez: “It’s what we call a distracter — kind of like you are.”The costumer Jacqueline West and the production designer Sharon Seymour labored to create the right period feel. “I wanted to spread the wardrobe and the cars out, so it wasn’t just everybody was there from 1979,” Mr. Affleck said. The look for John Goodman’s character, John Chambers, a real Hollywood makeup artist, was deliberately 1960s. (“You know, people get stuck in their eras,” Mr. Affleck said. “I’m stuck in ’93. That’s how I do it. Cargo pants are back.”)Mr. Affleck was also keen to home in on the workaday quality of spy life, especially the way it both connected and frayed its employees and their families. “The sacrifices that were being made were being done in silence,” he said. “We live in a culture now where you go on a talk show and say, ‘This is what I’ve done,’ or ‘This is the kind of victim I am.’ We’re very public with that sort of thing.”By contrast he wanted to pay tribute to C.I.A. officers who risk their lives yet take no credit. “As Tony often says, it’s not a place of deranged assassins,” he said. “It’s a place of people who’ve come in to work, work really hard, care about life, care about their country.”Marrying that vision with the satirical Hollywood story line was the challenge that most worried Mr. Affleck. Mr. Clooney, Matt Damon (Mr. Affleck’s childhood friend and “Good Will Hunting” co-writer), his brother Casey Affleck, pals like Bradley Cooper and select nonentertainment industry confidants served as sounding boards, helping convince Mr. Affleck that he had nailed the tone.“It’s a little bit of what I did with ‘The Town,’ ” he said. “I kind of wrapped what I thought was thoughtful, thematically interesting drama in the hard candy of shootouts and gun chases.”Though he called “Argo” “the best thing I’ve been involved with in my career,” there is one thing he fears will haunt him. With the screenwriter Chris Terrio (also an Oscar nominee) Mr. Affleck included the vulgar punch line that pivots through the movie, a catchphrase that puns on its title and is not quite fit for print.“I almost wish we didn’t do it,” Mr. Affleck said, “even though I think it works, because I have doomed myself for at least a few years of strangers coming up to me on the street” and playfully cursing him in the name of the movie."

Ivana Baquero plays the film’s heroine, Ofelia, who longs to believe in fairies, princesses and magic lands; Doug Jones, right, plays the woodland creature (a couple of them, actually) who charges her with three tasks. “Fairy tales (and scary movies) are designed to console as well as terrify,” A.

Nutsa Kukhianidze plays the beautiful teenage Russian émigré who follows him; Tcheky Karyo is the detective friend he has to stay a heartbeat ahead of. “Mr. Nolte uses ‘The Good Thief’ as a haven for a majestic ruin he has worked at for years,” Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times. “It’s quite an accomplishment. There aren’t many American actors who have made a penchant for self-destructive behavior blossom into a fully realized gallery of performances.” The movie, with its 1950s jazz elegance, “is the ultimate caper,” he added, “a work of brazen ebullience that does something unusual for Mr. Jordan: This is the first of his films that could be scored with a saxophone instead of a cello.

It’s still a big show, bigger than ever this year, with 3,200 exhibits and 150,000 attendees, but I wonder why people bother. Whose product announcement will get any press at all when it’s buried by 3,199 others?C.E.S.’s organizers publish a daily magazine during the show that profiles new products announced there. Here are some actual examples: “Braven Expands Bluetooth Speaker Line.” “Armpocket Unveils Smartphone Cases.” “Bits Ltd. Expands Line of Surge Protectors.”So if you want an exciting column from me, the thrills won’t come from the news of new products at C.E.S. I’ll have to spice things up another way. See what you think of this.As he plummets toward the Nevada desert, two deafening sounds assail Daxton Blackthorne’s eardrums — the wind rushing past his ears at terminal velocity, and a deafening explosion over his head. Fumbling for his parachute cord, he’s blasted by the searing heat from the fireball that, until seconds ago, was his Cessna Citation.For now, though, his concern isn’t the air-to-air missile that has just dispatched his jet, courtesy of the Bora Boran Mafia on his tail. It isn’t even the fact that Daxton Blackthorne is all that stands between them and the collapse of American democracy.It’s finding a good place to land.There! Squinting in the blinding sun, he spots an enormous chain of low-slung buildings, stretching through the bustling downtown like a sleeping cobra: the Las Vegas Convention Center.He hits the roof of the South Hall hard — too hard. Keeping low, he scuttles across the gravel to a ventilation shaft and emerges, moments later, in a blasting cacophony of color, sound and electronics.He hears the crash of boots behind him as his pursuers explode from the same shaft. Got to move, Daxton thinks. Detaching his ’chute, he darts among the booths, dodging clumps of buyers, reporters and electronics executives.He weaves among the exhibits, barely noting their wares. External battery packs for phones. Car chargers for phones. Screen protectors for phones. Cases for phones.What is this place? he thinks, pulse pounding.Booth after booth. GPS units. Tablets. Earbuds. Bluetooth speakers. Phone cases. Row after row of Chinese manufacturers he’s never heard of. Like this one, Huawei, selling the world’s largest Android phone — the thin, shiny Ascend Mate, with a 6.1-inch screen. That’d be like talking into a cutting board, he thinks.He bursts into the Central Hall, and the sensory overload is immediate; he pauses, gasping, to take it in. TV screens. Thousands. Screens bigger than a man. Screens stacked up to the distant ceiling. Screens brighter and louder than explosives in the morning. Sharp, Sony, Samsung, LG, Toshiba, Panasonic. The bombardment is almost as lethal as the one that took down his Cessna.Here are OLED screens, with incredibly black blacks, vivid colors and razor-thin bodies; this LG model is only 0.16 inches thick. Panasonic and Sony each claim “the world’s largest OLED screen” — 56-inch prototypes.Footsteps pound behind him. Too late to run. He’ll blend in. He merges into a throng of eager showgoers.“Three-D may have been a flop,” a rep is saying. “But this year, the industry is back with an irresistible offering: 4K television. Ultra HD, we call it. You thought HDTV was sharp? Now imagine: four times as many pixels. Stunning picture quality, in stunning screen sizes.”Daxton figures you’d have to sit pretty darned close to see any difference between HDTV and 4KTV. But never mind that — out of the corner of his eye, Daxton spots the black uniforms of his pursuers, fanning through the crowd. Play along, he thinks. “Excuse me,” he shouts in a faux French accent. “What is there to watch in 4K?”“Unfortunately, 4K video requires too much data for today’s cable, satellite, broadcast, Blu-ray, or Internet streaming,” is the reply. “But at Sony, we’re leading the way! If you buy our 84-inch 4K television for $25,000, we’ll lend you a hard drive with 10 Sony movies on it — in gorgeous 4K.”Daxton can think of better uses for $25,000; a jetpack would come in handy right about now. He dives into the crowd. Must. Find. Disguise.A crowd wearing headsets is gathered before a Samsung TV. That’ll do. He grabs one; it covers both his eyes and his ears.“You’re seeing a prototype of Samsung’s OLED dual-view technology,” the spokesman says. “This TV can display two 3-D video sources simultaneously, or four regular ones. Imagine: Your children can be playing Xbox while you watch the Super Bowl!” Daxton moves the switch on the earpiece; sure enough, the TV’s image changes accordingly, along with the audio from the tiny earpiece speakers.But angry shouts in Tahitian are closing in. He bolts through an archipelago of audio booths, hawking celebrity headphones bearing the names of the rapper 50 Cent, the heavy-metal band Motorhead, the runner Usain Bolt, the N.F.L. quarterback Tim Tebow and the TV reality star Snooki. When did Snooki become an audiophile? he wonders.By the time he storms into the North Hall, his lungs are screaming. He stands, panting, in a broader area populated by gleaming, polished automobiles. Here are Ford and General Motors, announcing new developer programs, open platforms for new apps that will run on their cars’ computer screens. Ford’s Sync AppLink bans games and video apps, for safety reasons. Good thinking, Daxton thinks. Wouldn’t want distracted driving.Here are Audi and Lexus, announcing self-driving cars. Glancing at the video loop, he notes that the Audi prototype can, at this point, drive itself only through specially equipped parking garages, like the one set up at the Mandarin Oriental for a demonstration.But on the Lexus stage, he spots something much more enticing: a car, festooned with sensors, that can actually drive itself on regular roads, much like Google’s fleet of 12 autonomous cars.“California and Nevada have both made self-driving cars legal, with certain restrictions,” the executive on stage says. “And this Lexus LS safety-research vehicle is a pioneer. The 360-degree laser on the roof detects objects up to 230 feet away; the front camera knows if the traffic light is red or green. Side cameras, GPS and radar enhance what could someday be a safe, efficient, road-aware vehicle.”There’s a burst of commotion from Daxton’s near right. It’s them. He vaults onto the stage. “Love the idea of self-driving cars,” Daxton tells the presenter. “But right now, I need a car I can drive myself.”A saber blade shatters the air next to his ear. With a burst of adrenaline, he dives through the open window of the Lexus. His assailants push through the crowd and clamber after him, but he’s already powered on the car. Huddling low, he guns the engine and shifts into gear.As a hail of bullets shatters the rear window, the Lexus arcs off the stage, plows through seven rotating shelves of phone cases, and, in a cloud of plaster and twisted beams, erupts through the wall of the convention center.With a wry smile, Daxton adjusts his rear-view mirror just in time to see the knot of black-suited Bora Borans shaking their fists in the distance.He brushes some safety glass off his shoulder, slips on sunglasses, and leans back into the leather seat.“Now that’s what I call an exciting show,” he says, grinning, and he swings onto the open road for home."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/movies/sundance-festival-shows-more-comedies.html,"The Sundance Film Festival has long had a dual personality. The atmosphere is typically fun and fizzy — Stars! Swag! Hot tub hopping! — while the films are dark and depressing, sometimes to the point of self-parody.This year, however, Sundance is looking a lot less bipolar.Reflecting shifts in the independent film world — both in terms of how festivals are programmed and what kinds of movies budding directors are putting forth — Sundance, which begins Thursday in Park City, Utah, will play 14 comedies and comedic dramas in its three most prominent sections. That may not sound like many until you look back at the 2010 Sundance schedule, which featured just five comedic movies in those divisions.“It’s certainly not the same stream of angst-ridden pictures we’ve seen in the past,” said Steve Beeks, Lionsgate’s chief operating officer.Predicting which films will pop at this year’s festival is a fool’s game. As Robert Redford, who founded the Sundance Institute in 1981, said in an interview, “You have to forget all the advance hoo-hah and hoopla and just watch the films.” But even Mr. Redford said he did a double take when he saw how many comedies made the cut. “I was surprised and quite encouraged,” he said.But three comedies in particular are generating advance buzz. “Don Jon’s Addiction,” about a pornography-obsessed Lothario, stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Scarlett Johansson. “In a World ...” by Lake Bell tells the story of a woman trying to follow in the professional footsteps of a movie-trailer voice-over star. “Ass Backwards” looks at two lovable-loser women who take a road trip to claim a beauty pageant crown that eluded them as children.Mr. Redford had a very simple explanation for the shift. “It says something about where we are as a world,” he said. “It’s a dark and cynical time, and humor is a way of dealing with it.”Ms. Bell agreed. “It comes down to what do I want to see next,” she said. “There is already so much stress and darkness in the world that I just don’t crave that great incest rape drama.”Sundance programmers, realizing that attendees were starting to roll their eyes at all the doom and gloom, have made a concerted effort in the last couple years to put more comedies in their mix. Rival festivals that show lighter films — notably South by Southwest — have been gaining more cultural cachet, perhaps adding pressure on Sundance to lighten up.Still, Trevor Groth, Sundance’s director of programming, noted that his team was at the mercy of what gets submitted (some 4,000 features this year). “The quality of comedies that were submitted this time around was better over all,” he said. “To make a film with a few comedic moments is one thing, but to sustain that humor over 90 minutes is extremely difficult.”Veteran independent film producers and agents point to business factors that make comedy more compelling. Filmmakers have realized that funny stories are both more attractive to financiers and more easily sellable through video-on-demand services; people browsing a list of movies from their sofas are more likely to choose a comedy as an impulse purchase.“Distributors aren’t looking for the next ‘Sex, Lies, and Videotape,’ ” said Leslye Headland, the director of the comedy “Bachelorette,” which played Sundance last year and was an on-demand hit, taking in more than $5 million. “They’re looking for the next ‘Little Miss Sunshine.’ ”“Sunshine,” a comedic drama that had its premiere at Sundance in 2006, went on to take in more than $100 million at the worldwide box office and receive an Oscar nomination for best picture.Jill Soloway, a successful television writer (“The United States of Tara”) whose first feature, “Afternoon Delight,” will have its premiere at Sundance on Monday, cited the Internet as an incubator of comedic talent. She said there were “mini bridges being built” to independent film from sites like Funny or Die, where aspiring filmmakers could experiment with comedic shorts.“Those videos allow you to try your hand at something small and then take the next step,” Ms. Soloway said. “Afternoon Delight,” about a housewife who tries to rescue a stripper, stars Kathryn Hahn (known to TV fans for “Parks and Recreation”), Jane Lynch and Juno Temple.Other comedies vying for attention here include David Gordon Green’s “Prince Avalanche,” centered on two 1980s-era highway workers, and the Jane Austen-focused “Austenland,” an over-the-top romp from Jerusha Hess, best known as a writer of “Napoleon Dynamite.” “Hell Baby,” starring Rob Corddry and Leslie Bibb, is about an expectant couple in need of the Vatican’s elite exorcism team and was directed by Robert Ben Garant and Thomas Lennon, the team behind “Reno 911!”There are serious currents running through this year’s festival, of course. One prominent theme involved sexuality, especially seen through the eyes of women. Most distributors are eager to see “Two Mothers,” a drama about friends (Naomi Watts and Robin Wright) who start sexual relationships with each other’s sons; if the story doesn’t skew too far to the creepy side, it could be an Oscar vehicle for the actresses. The Sutherland Institute, a conservative Salt Lake City policy group, on Friday made reference to the “Two Mothers” plot and “the amount of sexual promiscuity that Sundance Film Festival regularly brings to Utah” as part of a call for the state to end its financial support for the event.Almost every movie playing at Sundance — more than 100 features in total — are up for sale. The goal is somehow to follow in the footsteps of “Little Miss Sunshine” or at least “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which became a critical darling at the festival and is now an Oscar contender, racking up ticket sales of more than $11 million in the process.Which movie could be the “Beasts” of this year’s festival? Longtime attendees point toward “Blue Caprice,” a psychological drama based on the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks, and “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,” a “Bonnie and Clyde”-esque drama about a Texas outlaw and his wife that stars Rooney Mara and Casey Affleck.“At this point it’s still too early to tell,” said Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics and a festival attendee since the 1980s. “But I can say one thing with certainty: If you want to see what’s happening in the culture, Sundance is still the snapshot.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/arts/music/tweaking-raps-rules-but-with-respect.html,"What are the hallmarks of great rapping in 2013? Lyrical imagination and complexity, sure — those are always on the list. But they’re increasingly sharing space with things like texture, emotion, versatility, experimentation and confidence. Rap has always made room for innovation, eccentricity and dialect, but the range has never been wider.Arguments about what makes great rapping fail to grasp the beauty of the argument itself: there are so many options to choose from. Today’s great rappers don’t sound much like the ones they grew up on. Or sometimes they sound like everyone they grew up on, and then some.Meet ASAP Rocky, stylistic admixture supreme. A Harlem native with an expansive ear, he’s become one of hip-hop’s brightest new stars by interpreting the Internet-fueled melding of tastes and influences that’s a given of modern life. And he’s a peacock, doing it with flair and authority. He isn’t an answer to old debates so much as a renunciation of them.So while some choices on “Long.Live.ASAP” (Polo Grounds/RCA), his major-label debut album, feel familiar, it’s more as if they’re reflected in a fun-house mirror. There is New York rap, and also Houston and Cleveland and Miami and Los Angeles. There is 2013, but also 1992 and 1988 and 2007.Throughout, ASAP Rocky is charismatic, full of sly wit and curiosity, a tweaker of orthodoxy while upholding it at the same time. “Yeah my mouth is full of gold and I’m a city boy/And my outfit was in Vogue, I’m a pretty boy,” he raps on “Ghetto Symphony,” a bonus track, and one of the album’s highlights. On “1 Train,” an update of the typical New York posse cut, he’s compact:Bag made of GoyardCheffin’ like I’m Boyar--dee, probably selling Din your local courtyardBraids like I’m O-DogMy la familia go hardDown to my in-lawsThey outlaws with no lawsTypically ASAP Rocky likes how words sound more than what they say; this is an album light on narrative. But he writes tight little couplets that punch and swerve: “Pac gone but the ‘Juice’ back/ Get your popcorn, juice, snacks”; “Tell me what your name is/ I’ma tell it to my stainless”; “Put the chrome to your dome, make you sweat like Keith.”That last line is from his breakthrough single, which has a title unprintable here — “Problems” for short — and is by far the most literal song on this album. Produced by 40 and Drake, and featuring Drake, Kendrick Lamar and 2 Chainz, it’s a naked attempt to locate ASAP Rocky in the current hip-hop hierarchy. It succeeds but does him no favors because abstraction suits him best.Emphatic in his style, ASAP Rocky is an experimenter who doesn’t operate at the margins. He has the attitude of a longtime hip-hop star and uses that currency to buy himself a large amount of wiggle room.Some of his most powerful songs are the cloudiest. “Hell” — produced by Clams Casino, the ambient-industrial maven who produced some of ASAP Rocky’s most notable early songs — sounds like an orchestra being held hostage in an underground bunker with thinning oxygen. That’s followed by “Pain,” which sounds like Pharrell Williams being held hostage in an underground bunker with thinning oxygen. Even the album’s first song, the title track, is dank and foreboding, the opposite of a warm embrace. But it also features some of ASAP Rocky’s cockiest, sharpest rapping: “Strangers make me nervous/ Who’s that peeking in my window/with a pistol to my curtains?”As loud an entrance as ASAP Rocky has made in the hip-hop world, he has made one just as impressive in the fashion world, though the overlap isn’t always seamless. This album features the lamentable “Fashion Killa,” a song that renders dull on record — by playing fashion Mad Libs with a couple dozen designer names — what his outfits and natural charisma render vivid in real life. He’s set a fashion bar that more established artists are scrambling to reach — see the vintage Raf Simons sneakers/moon boots he wore on “Late Show With David Letterman” on Tuesday — and he’s almost certainly the first rapper to insult someone by declaring, “You overaccessorize.”For the most part ASAP Rocky doesn’t overaccessorize. Almost everything has a place. Occasionally he’s punished for not being a traditional New Yorker in terms of lyricism, which is wrong — there’s a heavy Cam’ron influence on this album — and shortsighted. He’s doing something that plenty of rappers from other regions have long done, and been lionized for.In a couple of spots on this album ASAP Rocky moves beyond these concerns altogether, opting for something postnarrative. On the second verse of “LVL” he raps with Big Pun dexterity, but prettier, moving effortlessly from words to onomatopoeic sounds, thickening the density of his flow the whole while until he’s virtually speaking in tongues. He does the same on “Problems.” That song is glossy, but he pushes against it in the latter half of his verse, which is mean, intricate and swings with attitude. He is pure flamboyance. Add that to the list."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/media/your-choose-your-expletive-ad-here.html,"WORDS that once would have had mouths on Madison Avenue washed out with soap are becoming common enough in advertisements that one could wonder if the familiar Wendy’s slogan from 1984, were it being introduced today, might be brought out as “Where’s the [choose your expletive] beef?”There are two main reasons, experts say, for the increasing frankness of the language in everyday advertising. One reason is that it reflects the increasing frankness of the American vernacular, as evidenced by the swear words that are uttered by characters in television series and that appear on the covers of mainstream magazines.The other reason for the trend is the greater efforts being made by marketers to appeal to the younger consumers, in their 20s and 30s, who are known as millennials or Generation Y. Because those consumers are generally more accepting of such language than their parents or grandparents, marketers say they believe that including those words will help the ads appeal to the target audience.For instance, the “creative sweet spot” for a $5 million campaign for a new product — a line of intimate wipes named Fresh and Sexy by Playtex, intended for use before or after sexual activity — is men and women in their late 20s, said Erik Rahner, group marketing director at the Energizer personal care division of Energizer Holdings in Shelton, Conn.The hope is that the campaign “bonds with our consumer and be fun, lighthearted and playful,” Mr. Rahner said, “yet bold enough to break through the clutter.” So the headlines for the ads are a carnival of carnal puns, featuring slang terms for body parts and the sex act.A tamer ad was also produced, to meet the standards of media companies that reject the headlines as too provocative. That ad carries the headline “Not keeping it clean always gets you rejected.”But only a few media outlets turned down the versions with the double entendre, Mr. Rahner said, adding that “at the majority, there was not even a debate” over their acceptability.Elaine McCormick, a creative director at Grey New York, the agency for the new product, said the inspiration for the cheeky headlines “was that we’re living in a ‘That’s what she said’ world.” Her reference is to the phrase that transforms a prosaic comment into a joke about sex; it is a favorite jape of Michael Scott, the character played by Steve Carell on the sitcom “The Office.”“It’s the idea of innuendo, that everything is open to interpretation,” said Ms. McCormick, whose agency is part of the Grey Group division of WPP. “I do think people are more accepting, and they want to have fun with an ad.”That kind of approach is also evident in a new campaign for the Gardein line of meatless food products, which carries the theme “Start a healthy relationship.” The campaign, with a budget estimated at $400,000 to $600,000, offers a twist on terms related to dating that millennials are wont to use: One ad calls the brand “a friend with nutritional benefits” and a second ad asks, “Tired of the meat market?”That language “is part of the social norm,” said Russell Barnett, vice president for marketing at the Los Angeles office of Garden Protein International, which sells Gardein.“Talking that way makes it easy to start the conversation” with potential customers, he added, and helps develop an image for the Gardein brand as “approachable.”At the same time, said Bob Froese, chief executive at the Gardein creative agency, the BrainStorm Group in Toronto, “we want to stay in the boundaries of good taste” because “when you deviate from that, you’re provocative for provocative’s sake.”“It is a very thin line,” Mr. Froese acknowledged.Mr. Barnett said the goal is for the campaign to be “playful, which is part of our brand tone.”“We went through tons and tons of lines” for the ads “to settle in on what feels comfortable and could be tied back to our product and what it stands for,” he added. “The moment we had to explain a line, it was wrong.”Still, one person’s playfulness may be another’s vulgarity. That is particularly true in categories in which consumers are willing to give marketers more leeway in the tone and language of ads, among them sex-related products, apparel and liquor. Sometimes, license veers off into what is perceived as licentiousness.For example, a campaign in 2009 for Three Olives, a vodka imported by Proximo, asked consumers a question with a double entendre that implied sexual ecstasy. A subsequent campaign used humor and a new one, with a budget estimated at $20 million, uses an endorsement approach, featuring the British actor Clive Owen.The new concept is to promote the “distinct and premium position” of the Three Olives brand in the vodka market, said Elwyn Gladstone, senior vice president for marketing at Proximo in Jersey City, by playing up that “it’s imported from England.” The ads call Three Olives “the London vodka.”As for the past provocative approach, “it is not a thing we have continued with,” Mr. Gladstone said, because “it just didn’t really catch people’s attention.” The new campaign is from an agency in Brooklyn called Dead As We Know It, which did not create the previous two campaigns."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/arts/television/conrad-bain-actor-on-diffrent-strokes-dies-at-89.html,"Conrad Bain, an accomplished stage and film actor who was best known for a late-career role on television as the white adoptive father of two poor black boys on the long-running comedy “Diff’rent Strokes,” died on Monday in Livermore, Calif. He was 89.His daughter, Jennifer Bain, confirmed the death on Wednesday.Mr. Bain had been familiar to television viewers as Dr. Arthur Harmon, a neighbor of Bea Arthur’s title character on “Maude,” when he joined the cast of “Diff’rent Strokes” in 1978, the beginning of an eight-season run. He played Phillip Drummond, a wealthy Manhattan widower who had promised his dying housekeeper, who was black and lived in Harlem, that he would rear her sons, Arnold (Gary Coleman) and Willis (Todd Bridges).Drummond had a biological daughter, Kimberly, played by Dana Plato, and the show’s plotlines interwove punch lines with larger lessons about the experiences of a racially blended family.Mr. Bain’s Drummond was stiff but steady and warm when necessary, the implication being that willingly adopting and nurturing poor, older black children attested to the strength of his character.“You know, a lot of people just talk of taking on bigots,” Drummond said to Kimberly in an early episode, after she had rejected a suitor who told her he did not like being around black people, “but very few people ever really do.”Drummond’s gentle moralizing, as well as his gentle language — using “bigots” rather than “racists” — was central to the show, which was popular with both black and white viewers. But the show was also criticized as simplistic and patronizing.Henry Louis Gates Jr., writing in The New York Times in 1989, three years after the show’s final season, said “Diff’rent Strokes” followed a tradition of “domestication” and “cultural dwarfism” of black men in mainstream entertainment, “in which small black ‘boys’ (arrested adolescents who were much older than the characters they played) were adopted by tall, successful white males,” who “represented the myth of the benevolent paternalism of the white upper class.”Mr. Coleman, who was diminutive because of treatments related to a congenital kidney disease, said later that he had come to dislike the scenes in which, even when he had become a teenager in real life, his character continued to hop into Mr. Bain’s lap for yet another light lecture.In one final-season episode that focused on older foster children, Drummond looked into the camera and said: “Being father to these boys brought a warmth and richness into my life that I never could possibly have imagined. And of course I was able to give two kids a chance that they might otherwise have been denied.”Drummond delivered an occasional cultural jab as well. In an early episode he tells Arnold he is going out for dinner with a friend from England.“England?” Arnold says. “Isn’t that where they talk funny?”“No,” Mr. Drummond replies, “that’s the Bronx.”Jennifer Bain said her father was warm, loving and politically liberal, but bore few other similarities to Drummond.“My father was far more interesting than that character,” Ms. Bain said, adding, “We were a very intellectual, artsy family.”Conrad Stafford Bain was born on Feb. 4, 1923, in Lethbridge, Alberta, in Canada. He attended the Banff School of Fine Arts in Alberta and served as a sergeant in the Canadian Army from 1943 to 1946. He then moved to New York, where he graduated from the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.He spent much of the next 30 years in the theater, making his New York debut Off Broadway in 1956 in “The Iceman Cometh.” In 1971 he appeared in Ibsen’s “Enemy of the People” by the Repertory Theater of Lincoln Center.Besides his daughter, he is survived by two sons, Mark and Kent, and a twin brother, Bonar. His wife of more than 60 years, the abstract painter and art collector Monica Bain (born Monica Sloan), died in 2009.The three child actors who starred alongside Mr. Bain on “Diff’rent Strokes” struggled in their private lives with substance abuse and legal and financial problems. Mr. Coleman died in 2010 at 42. Ms. Plato died of a drug overdose in 1999 at 34. Mr. Bridges was acquitted of attempted murder in 1990.Mr. Bridges, who remained in contact with Mr. Bain, said in a statement that “in addition to being a positive and supportive father figure both on and off screen, Conrad was well loved and made going to work each day enjoyable for all of us.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/business/fda-to-tighten-regulation-of-all-metal-hip-implants.html,"After an estimated 500,000 patients in the United States have received a type of artificial hip that is failing early in many cases, the Food and Drug Administration is proposing rules that could stop manufacturers from selling such implants.Under the proposal, which the agency is expected to announce on Thursday, makers of artificial hips with all-metal components would have to prove the devices were safe and effective before they could continue selling existing ones or obtain approval for new all-metal designs.Currently, companies have to show only that their devices resemble ones already on the market, and they are not required to conduct clinical studies before selling them.The F.D.A. action is intended to close a loophole in the 1976 federal law under which medical devices were first regulated. It is the agency’s first use of powers that Congress granted to it last year to deal with medical devices, like all-metal hips, that have been in regulatory limbo for decades.The move comes amid one of the biggest device-related failures in decades. Just a few years ago, all-metal hips — implants in which the ball and cup component is made from a metallic alloy — were used in one of every three joint replacement procedures performed annually in the United States.Traditional hip replacements, which are made of materials like plastic and metal, typically last 15 years before wearing out. But the all-metal hips, which companies rarely tested in patients before aggressively marketing them, are failing at high rates not long after implantation.As a result, thousands of patients have been forced to undergo painful and costly operations to replace the devices. In addition, tiny particles of metallic debris released as the artificial joints move have caused severe tissue and bone damage in hundreds of patients, leaving some of them disabled.Dr. William H. Maisel, deputy director for science at the F.D.A., said the agency’s proposal would require makers of all-metal hips to produce clinical data to justify their use because of the “large number of patients who received these products and the numbers of adverse events associated with them.”The use of all-metal implants has plummeted, with the devices now accounting for about 5 percent of hip implants. For some of those devices, which are used in a procedure called resurfacing that is an alternative to total hip replacement, the F.D.A. already requires clinical trials before granting approval.The impact of the proposal on manufacturers of traditional all-metal hips will not be immediate, and industry lobbyists may oppose its adoption or seek to modify it. Agency officials said it would most likely take a year for the rules to be finalized; after that, producers will have 90 days to submit clinical data to support a device’s safety and effectiveness.In 2011, the F.D.A. ordered manufacturers of all-metal hips to conduct post-marketing studies to determine, among other things, whether the implants were shedding high levels of metallic debris. Dr. Maisel said he expected that device makers might try to use data from those studies to satisfy the proposed requirements.If a company decided not to submit clinical data or if the information failed to meet agency standards, it would have to stop selling the implant.The regulatory limbo involving all-metal hips resulted from the Medical Device Amendments of 1976. The law set differing test requirements for various devices, depending on the perceived risk of using them or the role they played in sustaining a patient’s life and health.Producers of devices considered high risk, like implanted heart defibrillators, had to perform clinical trials to obtain F.D.A. approval for new products. But makers of devices considered less risky, like hospital pumps, had to show only that a new product resembled one already on the market.However, at the time the legislation was passed, several types of medical devices, including all-metal hips, were already on the market. So lawmakers crafted what was supposed to be a temporary solution: regulators would treat potentially high-risk products like the hips as moderate-risk products until officially determining how to classify them.But in the case of all-metal hips, the final classification never happened. Over the years, the F.D.A. started procedures to classify the implants but never completed them. Implant companies also lobbied the agency to classify all-metal hips as moderate-risk products rather than high-risk ones.The result was that device makers like Johnson & Johnson and Zimmer Holdings were able to start selling a new generation of all-metal hips a decade ago without running clinical tests.Under the Food and Drug Administration Safety and Innovation Act of 2012, the agency now has a more streamlined way of classifying older devices. It no longer has to seek an economic review of a decision’s impact, a process that can take years, said Nancy K. Stade, the F.D.A.’s deputy director for policy.About 20 types of older medical devices still await reclassification.In recent weeks, the first of thousands of patient lawsuits involving the most troubled all-metal device, an implant once sold by the DePuy division of Johnson & Johnson, have started to come to trial. Some plaintiffs’ lawyers say it may cost Johnson & Johnson billions of dollars to resolve the litigation, which involves an implant called the Articular Surface Replacement.On Thursday, the F.D.A. also expects to issue new guidance to doctors monitoring patients who have received all-metal hips.For the first time, the agency will recommend that patients who are experiencing pain or other symptoms that indicate possible device failure undergo routine testing to detect levels of metallic ions in their blood.Dr. Maisel said the agency was not recommending a specific ion level at which doctors should consider replacing an implant.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/17/arts/television/scandal-on-abc-is-breaking-barriers.html,"“Scandal,” now in its second season, has been a success for ABC. Last week the show had 3.52 million viewers aged 18 to 49 and 8.4 million total viewers. Among the group aged 18 to 34 it typically ranks first in its 10 p.m. Thursday time slot. A political thriller set in Washington, “Scandal” has attracted some inside-the-beltway fans like the political strategists Donna Brazile and Roland S. Martin, who have both tweeted about the show.The show’s other sweet spot — one that network executives seem less eager to discuss — is its success among African-American audiences. According to Nielsen “Scandal” is the highest rated scripted drama among African-Americans, with 10.1 percent of black households, or an average of 1.8 million viewers, tuning in during the first half of the season.One reason for that success is the casting of Kerry Washington, who became the first African-American female lead in a network drama in almost 40 years. (The first was Teresa Graves as an undercover cop in “Get Christie Love!”, which had its debut in 1974.)Her casting has prompted discussion among academics and fans of the show about whether “Scandal” represents a new era of postracial television, in which cast members are ethnically diverse but are not defined by their race or ethnicity.“There’s an audience of African-Americans who just want to see themselves in a good story, not necessarily a race-specific show,” said Joan Morgan, a fan of the series and the author of “When Chickenheads Come Home to Roost,” a book about black women and feminism today. “It’s not about this being a black show,” Ms. Morgan said. “It’s about seeing the show where black women and other women are represented less about race and more about who they are.”“Scandal” follows the twists and turns of Olivia Pope, a political fixer played by Ms. Washington, and her team of lawyers, hackers and political insiders. The character is loosely based on the real Washington operative Judy Smith, a former member of the George H. W. Bush White House and well-known crisis manager who has represented, among others, Monica Lewinsky and Michael Vick. (Ms. Smith is a co-executive producer on the show). Olivia is also having an affair with the president of the United States, Fitzgerald Thomas Grant III, played by Tony Goldwyn.Asked whether she felt any pressure being in this unusual position, Ms. Washington said the pressure was on the audience more than on the cast and crew. She said in an e-mail: “The question was: Are audiences ready to have the stories that we tell on television to be more inclusive? Are we ready for our protagonists to represent people of all different genders and ethnicities?”“I think the success of the show speaks to how we have become more inclusive as a society because the fans of the show span all different races and ages and genders,” she wrote. “It’s very exciting.” For Dr. Brittney Cooper, co-founder of Crunk Feminist Collective and assistant professor of women’s studies at Rutgers University, the subtleties of Ms. Washington’s character, Olivia Pope, make her most attractive.“The few black women we’ve seen in prime-time roles in scripted shows, they have to be morally above scrutiny, and she’s not,” Dr. Cooper said. In addition to her relationship with the president, Ms. Washington’s character has defended the reputations of dictators, executives and politicians.“She’s the most complex black female lead we’ve ever seen in prime time,” Dr. Cooper said. “You’re not getting an archetype, you’re not getting a stereotype, you’re getting a fully fledged human being,” she said.Shonda Rhimes, the executive producer and creator of the show declined repeated requests for an interview, and representatives for the show seem less interested in talking about the subject of race and “Scandal.” While excited about the show’s success among African-American audiences, they were eager to point out the show’s success among all audiences.Ms. Rhimes also created “Grey’s Anatomy” and “Private Practice,” shows that have also prominently featured ethnically diverse casts and interracial relationships. One of the few instances in which race was directly addressed by the characters in “Scandal” was an exchange between Olivia and Fitz, as the president is known. Olivia, discussing their relationship, tells him, “I’m feeling a little Sally Hemings-Thomas Jefferson about all this.” Later Fitz confronts Olivia and tells her that the comment was “below the belt.”“You’re playing the race card on the fact that I’m in love with you,” he says.Twitter and Facebook lit up with reaction. “Rhimes is so smart.” said Dr. Kaila Story, who holds the Audre Lorde chair in race, class, gender and sexuality studies at the University of Louisville. She said the producer wanted to make clear this was a very different kind of relationship. “The whole institution of enslavement in and of itself does not engender a romantic relationship,” Dr. Story said.Social media was part of the show’s strategy from the beginning. During broadcasts cast members live-tweet about each episode. “The fans look forward to joining the cast each week so they can ‘watch together’ and talk about the show while it’s on,” Marla Provencio, the executive vice president for marketing and the chief marketing officer at the ABC Entertainment Group, wrote in an e-mail.The network’s efforts seem to have paid off. The show has a healthy number of people tweeting during the broadcast, and virtual “Scandal” parties have sprung up on Facebook so friends can watch and comment together. The last episode of the show before its hiatus in December generated 2,838 tweets per minute and a total of 157,601 tweets.“I can connect with my sister in Houston, my friends who are living across the country, everybody who is watching the show,” said Diane Johnson a vice president in Washington for Ketchum, a public relations company, and an avid fan of the show who was invited to a virtual Facebook party. “It enhances the entertainment factor for me.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/nyregion/bronx-rising-at-bronx-music-heritage-center-lab.html,"The rap superstar Jay-Z performed eight concerts in September to open the Barclays Center in Brooklyn. It was a crowning moment both for the borough and for this native son, born Shawn Carter, who grew up in the Marcy Houses just up the street in Bedford-Stuyvesant.And yet, if on the wings of Jay-Z’s success Brooklyn can lay claim to being the center of the hip-hop universe these days, he would surely be among the first to concede that the culture was really born in another borough, a few miles to the north. It was in the “Boogie Down” Bronx, beginning in the late 1970s, that the elements of hip-hop culture were first codified.The spirit of those freewheeling early years was captured in “Style Wars,” the 1983 PBS documentary by Tony Silver and Henry Chalfant. The film features figures like Mayor Edward I. Koch and the break dancers Rock Steady Crew offering perspectives on the nascent culture, which had spread into the other boroughs and was poised to capture worldwide attention. A screening of the film on Friday night, followed by a question-and-answer session with Mr. Chalfant, anchors this weekend’s Bronx Rising! events at the Bronx Music Heritage Center Lab.On Saturday night an exhibition of photographs by Joe Conzo Jr. culled from his book “Born in the Bronx” will go back even further into hip-hop history, providing a visual document of the musical energy born in the parks, playgrounds and abandoned warehouses of the borough in the late 1970s. Mr. Conzo will be on hand to discuss his work.Admission to each event is free, with a $5 suggested donation.(“Style Wars,” Friday at 8 p.m.; “Born in the Bronx,” Saturday at 7:30 p.m.; 1303 Louis Niñé Boulevard, at Southern Boulevard, Crotona East; bronxmusic.org.)JOURNAL MAKINGThe cultural history of the Bronx doesn’t begin and end with hip-hop, and a generous portion of that heritage can be found among the books and artifacts at the Huntington Free Library. Founded in 1892, the library is a privately owned public reading room with a noncirculating collection. For years it was home to an extensive collection of American Indian art and manuscripts, but after Cornell University bought that trove in 2004, the library began to reposition itself as a community hub.On Saturday, in partnership with the Bronx Council on the Arts, a local artist, Lis Ortiz, will lead a free journal-making workshop there. Participants should bring their own materials to recycle into a journal, perfect for committing any resolutions for 2013. Reservations required.(Saturday from 12:30 to 3 p.m.; 9 Westchester Square, Westchester Village; 718-829-7770; bronxnyc.com.)"

(Nate Chinen)★ Tim Berne’s Paraphrase (Thursday) This rugged trio engages in an interplay that’s unscripted but hardly formless, thanks to the equal exertions of Tim Berne, alto saxophonist; Drew Gress, bassist; and Tom Rainey, drummer. The band hasn’t played together in New York in a while, which lends this concert, part of the Sound It Out series, the air of a special event. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, greenwichhouse.org; $15, $12 for students. (Chinen)★ Terence Blanchard Quintet (Friday and Saturday) In certain circles Terence Blanchard may be best known as an accomplished film scorer and a newly established Broadway composer; around the jazz ecosystem he’s known for his trenchant trumpet playing, and for favoring a postbop sound informed by myriad sources. His influential working band plays music not only by Mr. Blanchard but also by most of its bright younger members. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 to $40 cover, with a $10 minimum.

It will feature a “Birth of the Cool”-style nonet whose roster includes the nonagenarian saxophonist Frank Wess, the octogenarian guitarist Bucky Pizzarelli, the trumpeter Jeremy Pelt (who’s in his mid-30s) and the singer Mary Stallings (whose age, she would probably say, is none of your business).

(Chinen)Cyrus Chestnut 50th Birthday Celebration (Tuesday through Jan. 27) Mr. Chestnut, a sure-footed pianist with a particular gift for gospel flourish, turned 50 this week. He commemorates the milestone next week with his working quartet — featuring Stacey Dillard on saxophones, Dezron Douglas on bass and Neal Smith on drums — and what’s likely to include a string of guests. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 to $45 cover, $15 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum.

Ekmeles is a new-music a cappella ensemble directed by the baritone Jeffrey Gavett; its repertory here will include works by Louis Karchin, Ben Johnston and Aaron Cassidy. As for Mr. akLaff, he’s a drummer and composer with an avant-garde profile, presenting two pieces with original librettos, inspired by his travels in the East.

At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $20 cover at tables, $10 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)★ Al Foster (Friday, Saturday and Tuesday through Jan. 27) Mr. Foster has long been a drummer of laid-back locomotion, no less intense for sounding so casual. Friday happens to be his 70th birthday, and he’ll celebrate the occasion with a crew consisting of Wallace Roney on trumpet, Adam Birnbaum on piano and Doug Weiss on bass. Next week he’ll lead a quartet, with the tenor saxophonist Eric Alexander in place of Mr. Roney: a spruce substitution, most likely to produce less heat but nearly as many sparks. Friday and Saturday at 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover.

(Chinen)Tomas Fujiwara Trio (Wednesday) The intrepid drummer Tomas Fujiwara has been working meaningfully as a bandleader in recent years, typically with the instrumentation (if not the metabolism) of a classic jazz quintet. He pares down but preserves his momentum in this new trio, featuring an improvisational odd couple: the surgically precise trumpeter Ralph Alessi and the strategically unruly guitarist and banjoist Brandon Seabrook. At 8 p.m., Barbès, 376 Ninth Street, at Sixth Avenue, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (347) 422-0248, barbesbrooklyn.com; $10. (Chinen)Pedro Giraudo Expansions Jazz Orchestra (Friday and Saturday) This Latin-jazz big band — led by Pedro Giraudo, an Argentine bassist with strong ideas about rhythm and orchestration — exudes a firm unity of purpose on “Córdoba” (Zoho), its most recent album. He kicks off a season of touring with this show, leading a top-shelf crew, with the likes of Tatum Greenblatt on trumpet, Ryan Keberle on trombone and Ben Wendel on saxophones. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)Benny Goodman Reinvented: 75th Anniversary, Carnegie Hall Concert (Friday through Sunday) Designed as a salute to Goodman’s landmark 1938 concert at Carnegie Hall, this celebration features Ken Peplowski in the hot seat on clarinet and musical direction, along with a midsize crew well suited to ebullient swing. (The lineup includes Terell Stafford on trumpet, Lew Tabackin on tenor saxophone and James Burton on trombone.) At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum ($25 and $15 on Sunday.) (Chinen)★ Barry Harris Trio (Friday through Sunday) Barry Harris belongs to a generation of jazz pianists who carried the torch of bebop into an uncertain future. His touch and melodic instinct are unerring, and he leads this working trio — Ray Drummond is the bassist, Leroy Williams the drummer — with well-earned ease. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)Gilad Hekselman Quartet (Tuesday) A smart guitarist awash in contemporary harmony and multiple strains of groove, Gilad Hekselman re-enlists the excellent partners heard on his most recent album, “Hearts Wide Open” (Le Chant du Monde): Mark Turner on tenor saxophone, Joe Martin on bass and Marcus Gilmore on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20. (Chinen)★ Vijay Iyer Trio (Wednesday through Jan. 27) The standout jazz album of 2012, at least by critical consensus, was “Accelerando” (ACT), a brilliant second effort from this aerodynamic trio. Led by the pianist Vijay Iyer and featuring the bassist Stephan Crump and the drummer Marcus Gilmore, the group strikes a balance of cleverly reframed cover tunes and vertiginously propulsive originals, finding endless traction in changeable rhythm. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set next Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25, $30 next Friday and Saturday. (Chinen)★ José James (Wednesday) A suave and self-possessed young singer who comes to jazz through post-D’Angelo soul and shrewdly hazy R&B, Mr. James has a slippery new album, “No Beginning, No End” (Blue Note), that shows just what he can do, without seeming overeager about it. He typically has a top-shelf crew, with musicians like the young pianist Kris Bowers; he appears here to kick off a season of touring. At 8 p.m., Highline Ballroom, 431 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 414-5994, highlineballroom.com; $15 in advance, $18 day of show. (Chinen)Igor Lumpert Quartet (Wednesday) The Slovenian tenor saxophonist Igor Lumpert has forged his share of relationships with musicians in New York, where he received some of his formal training. His rewarding recent album, “Innertextures Live” (Clean Feed), has the bassist Chris Tordini and the drummer Nasheet Waits; for this one-nighter he’ll work with Mr. Waits again, alongside the pianist Orrin Evans and the bassist Ben Street. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $10 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)Music of John Lewis: Aaron Diehl, Warren Wolf, David Wong and Rodney Green (Friday through Sunday) John Lewis, the lean, fastidious pianist behind the Modern Jazz Quartet, looms as a major touchstone for Aaron Diehl — and you could easily say something similar about the relationship between Milt Jackson, the MJQ’s soulful vibraphonist, and Warren Wolf, one of his many inheritors. With David Wong on bass and Rodney Green on drums, this emulation will probably be both respectful and playful. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $30 to $40 cover, $15 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)The Music of Gerry Mulligan and John Lewis (Friday and Saturday) The saxophonist Gerry Mulligan and the pianist John Lewis were musicians of thoughtful elegance, at home with both chamber dynamics and bebop’s hyper-clarity. Jazz at Lincoln Center pays them a joint homage with arrangements for its house orchestra, led by Wynton Marsalis and featuring an engaging young guest pianist, Jonathan Batiste. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $28.50 to $120. (Chinen)★ Sam Newsome, Tim Berne, Ethan Iverson, Andrew Cyrille (Wednesday and Thursday) A convergence of four fearless improvisers stationed at slightly different aesthetic coordinates but more than capable of finding communion. Mr. Newsome is a soprano saxophonist, while Mr. Berne primarily plays alto; they join Mr. Iverson on piano and Mr. Cyrille, the uncompromising elder statesman of this assemblage, on drums. From 9:30 p.m. to midnight, Smalls Jazz Club, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 252-5091, smallsjazzclub.com; $20 cover. (Chinen)Aaron Parks (Friday and Saturday) Mr. Parks, a pianist bringing postbop flexibility to an indie-rockish sonic palette, is partway through a three-night residency at Shapeshifter Lab in Brooklyn, presenting different material each night. On Friday he’ll present new compositions for a trio with the bassist Thomas Morgan and the drummer R. J. Miller. On Saturday he’ll build on that rhythm team but lead a sextet, with Dayna Stephens on tenor saxophone, Charles Altura on guitar and Pete Rende on analog synthesizers and other keyboards. At 8:30 and 10 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10 on Friday, $15 on Saturday. (Chinen)Matthew Shipp, William Parker, Joe Morris, Gerald Cleaver (Thursday) These sly wizards of free improvisation have worked together in many configurations, usually reaching high-level cohesion. Here there’ll be one set apiece by two trios: the early one featuring Mr. Shipp on piano, Mr. Parker on bass and Mr. Morris on guitar, and the later one with Mr. Parker and Mr. Morris along with Mr. Cleaver on drums. At 8 and 10 p.m., the Stone, Avenue C and Second Street, East Village, thestonenyc.com; $10 for each set. (Chinen)Omar Sosa and Paolo Fresu (Thursday through Jan. 27) Mr. Sosa, a Cuban pianist and composer, and Mr. Fresu, an Italian trumpeter, have collaborated fruitfully before, notably on the 2011 album “Alma” (Ota), which flutters in the jet stream of global pop. They reprise their lyrical and worldly rapport here, with no additional accompaniment. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)Trio of Piano Trios (Friday) The words “emerging” and “young” and “poised” appear nowhere in the otherwise descriptive title of this concert, though they easily could have. First on the bill is the Julian Waterfall Pollack Trio, led by its namesake pianist with an earnest air. Next is Stranahan/Zaleski/Rosato, a graceful collective comprising the pianist Glenn Zaleski, the bassist Rick Rosato and the drummer Colin Stranahan. And finally there’s the Sam Harris Trio, which in addition to Mr. Harris on piano will feature Martin Nevin on bass and Craig Weinrib on drums. At 9 p.m., 92YTriBeCa, 200 Hudson Street, at Canal Street, (212) 601-1000, 92ytribeca.org; $15. (Chinen)Roseanna Vitro and the RNP Band (Friday) Ms. Vitro is a jazz singer of smoky sincerity, and in this program she pays tribute to two masters of jazz impressionism, Bill Evans and Clare Fischer. Her accompanying cohort consists of the pianist Mark Soskin, the violinist Sara Caswell, the bassist Dean Johnson and the drummer Tim Horner. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $25 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)Jeff (Tain) Watts’s Blu 4 (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Watts, an intelligent steamroller of a drummer, leads two groups this weekend, each a canvas for his compositions. Blu 4, appearing on Friday, features Mark Whitfield on guitar, Manuel Valera on piano and Yunior Terry Cabrera on bass. And Watts Family Reunion Band is his take on the big-band tradition, with a crew that includes the multireedist Don Byron, the trumpeter Lew Soloff, the guitarist Paul Bollenback and the trombonist Clark Gayton. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)"

Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.★ ‘Amour’ (PG-13, 2:07) A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between, the latest from the great director Michael Haneke (“The White Ribbon,” “Caché”) takes a long, hard, tender look at an elderly French couple, Georges and Anne — played by two titans of French cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva — in their final days. Bring hankies. (Manohla Dargis)★ ‘Argo’ (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)★ ‘Barbara’ (PG-13; 1:45) Christian Petzold directs this tense, smart film about an East German doctor (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been banished to the boonies. There, in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police, she waits and she burns. (Dargis)★ ‘Chasing Ice’ (PG-13, 1:16) The timing couldn’t be better for this documentary about the work of James Balog, who set out to provide visual evidence of the effects of global warming by taking time-lapse photographs of melting glaciers. The images are as beautiful as they are important. (Neil Genzlinger)★ ‘Django Unchained’ (R, 2:45) Blaxploitation and spaghetti western meet in the Old South in Quentin Tarantino’s latest provocation, with — literally! — explosive results. Jamie Foxx is Django, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), whose partner and protégé he becomes. After the two kill a bunch of bad guys, they set off to free Django’s wife (Kerry Washington) from captivity at a nightmarish plantation. Bloody, farcical and cartoonish, “Django Unchained” is at once a wildly entertaining, borderline-irresponsible fantasy and a bold and serious attempt to use the imaginative resources of popular culture to address an old and durable historical injustice. (A. O. Scott)★ ‘Fairhaven’  (No rating, 1:21) There isn’t a dishonest moment in Tom O’Brien’s small, piercingly wistful portrait of three longtime buddies in their mid-30s who reunite around a funeral in a southeastern Massachusetts fishing community.(Stephen Holden)★ ‘56 Up’ (No rating, 2:24) The latest installment in Michael Apted’s remarkable documentary project that has followed a group of Britons since 1964, starting when they were 7, checks in on them at 56. (Dargis)‘Gangster Squad’ (R, 1:53) This brainless, hopped-up, ultraviolent Los Angeles noir, directed by Reuben Fleischer, assembles an impressive cast (including Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone) and some spiffy period costumes. (Scott)‘A Haunted House’  (R, 1:37) The brand of horror film that features hand-held cameras and found footage probably didn’t need spoofing in the first place, but this clumsy movie tries anyway. It fails, because the writers (Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez) and director (Mike Tiddes) are content with sophomoric humor and lazy story about a couple (Mr. Wayans and Essence Atkins) who decide to move in together. A demon moves in too. (Genzlinger)‘The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’ (PG-13, 2:50) Peter Jackson’s adaptation of the J.R.R. Tolkien novel — the first in a trilogy of films — is a slick, bloated lumbering bore, a profit-minded exercise in theme-park-ride cinema that has neither the charm of the book nor the grandeur of Mr. Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” movies. (Scott)‘The Impossible’ (PG-13; 1:47) A story of survival set against the Asian tsunami of 2004, about a British family (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are the parents) vacationing in Thailand when disaster strikes. The performances are excellent (Tom Holland, as the couple’s oldest son, is especially strong) and the director, Juan Antonio Bayona, deftly recreates both the violence of the killer waves and the desolation they left in their wake. Still, there is something troubling about the film’s almost complete neglect of the non-Western victims of the tsunami. This is the story of a very bad holiday rather than of a mass catastrophe. (Scott)‘Life of Pi’ (PG, 2:06) In bringing Yann Martel’s beloved novel to the screen, Ang Lee has created a 3-D digital fable that is often stunning to behold. The middle section, in which the title character and a Bengal tiger share a lifeboat after a shipwreck, is touching and clever, but its delicacy is spoiled by a fuzzy, cloying spiritualism that hangs over everything like a humid cloud. (Scott)★ ‘Lincoln’ (PG-13, 2:29) Daniel Day-Lewis plays the Great Emancipator with playful wit as well as gravity. This film, directed by Steven Spielberg from a bristling, discursive script by Tony Kushner, focuses on Lincoln’s political skills and confines itself mainly to a single momentous month in his presidency. The superb supporting cast (including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln, and Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens) helps turn the movie into a group portrait of leadership in crisis. It’s a democratic masterpiece — a history lesson full of historical detail and honest patriotic emotion. (Scott)‘Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola’  (No rating, 2:30, in Hindi) A mix of gently outraged populism and low-powered romantic comedy, this Hindi film directed by Vishal Bhardwaj (“Omkara” and “Maqbool”) might have been better with a chunk lopped off its two-and-a-half-hour run time. Still the lazy pace yields some pleasures, especially the performance of Pankaj Kapur as a drunken industrialist. (Rachel Saltz)‘Les Misérables’ (PG-13, 2:37) Tom Hooper (“The King’s Speech”) directs this overly busy screen version of the popular musical with Hugh Jackman as the reformed prisoner, Russell Crowe as his tormentor and Anne Hathaway as the prostitute turned martyr. By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat. (Dargis)‘Parental Guidance’ (PG, 1:44) Billy Crystal stars as a baseball announcer who, when not being indulged by his wife (Bette Midler), schools his daughter (Marisa Tomei) and grandkids on the right way to do everything. Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse wrote the script, and Andy Fickman gives it some snap.(Dargis)‘Promised Land’ (R, 1:46) Matt Damon (who wrote the screenplay with his co-star John Krasinski) plays Steve Butler, dispatched to a small town by an energy conglomerate to buy the rights to underground natural gas from the local farmers. He encounters a mixed welcome, and his job is complicated by the arrival of an aggressive and charming environmental activist (Mr. Krasinski). The cast — also including Frances McDormand, Rosemarie DeWitt and Hal Holbrook — is excellent, and the director, Gus Van Sant, lingers over offbeat details and offhand moments. But when the time comes for the movie to make its point, it falls back on creaky plot twists and puffed-up, over-earnest speeches. (Scott)‘Quartet’ (PG-13, 1:38) A chance to watch vintage British actors in mildly naughty, gently touching circumstances. Dustin Hoffman directed this tale of retired musicians — played by Billy Connolly, Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay, among others — settling old scores and singing old songs. (Scott)★ ‘Searching for Sugar Man’ (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul’s hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don’t wait for the DVD. (Dargis)★ ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ (R, 2:00) David O. Russell’s exuberant new comedy tracks the feverish, happy, sad, absurdly funny ups and downs of a head case (Bradley Cooper) just as he returns to his parents’ home after eight months in a mental institution. When he meets a heartbreak beauty (Jennifer Lawrence), he finds fresh purpose in a movie that honks for happiness. (Dargis)‘Texas Chainsaw 3D’ (R, 1:32) Leatherface, the temperamental brute with a penchant for lumber tools, gives lessons in 3-D homicide to a class of fresh-looking actors (including Alexandra Daddario of “Percy Jackson & the Olympians,” as his long-lost cousin; Scott Eastwood (yes, Clint’s son); and Tremaine Neverson, a k a the singer Trey Songz. They graduate with flying limbs. (Webster)★ ‘West of Memphis’ (R, 2:25) A work of fierce documentary advocacy directed by Amy Berg (“Deliver Us From Evil”), “West of Memphis” follows the successful crusade to free three men wrongly convicted of murder 18 years ago in a sloppy, hysterical rush to justice. The film is inspiring but infuriating, because the deal to release them from prison allowed their coerced guilty plea to stand. (Holden)★ ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow’s brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid. Written by Mark Boal, the movie is a seamless weave of truth and drama as well as a wrenchingly sad, soul-shaking story about revenge and its moral costs. See it, fight over it, but don’t ignore it. (Dargis)Film SeriesCurators’ Choice: The Best of 2012 (Saturday and Sunday) Four favorites from the past year as selected by David Schwartz and Rachael Rakes of the Museum of the Moving Image. “Turin Horse,” which the museum’s Web site calls Bela Tarr’s “meditation on ‘the heaviness of human existence,’ ” kicks off the weekend at 3 p.m. on Saturday. It will be followed, at 6 p.m., by Kleber Mendonça Filho’s portrait of a middle-class neighborhood in Recife, Brazil, “Neighboring Sounds.” On Sunday are screenings of, at 3 p.m., “This Is Not a Film,” a documentary shot largely on a cellphone by the Iranian director Jafar Panahi, who is now officially prohibited from making movies in his native country, and, at 5 p.m., Wes Anderson’s enchanting preteen romance, “Moonrise Kingdom,” with Bruce Willis, Edward Norton, Bill Murray and Frances McDormand among the grown-up cast members. 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us; $12.(Dave Kehr)New Yawk New Wave (Friday through Thursday; through Jan. 31) Film Forum’s survey of independent filmmaking in New York City continues with some guest appearances.

His latest solo album, “Prisoner of Conscious,” has been delayed and will now be released in April; in the meantime he takes charge of S.O.B.’s annual Martin Luther King Jr. concert, which was overseen delightfully for years by the poet and hip-hop progenitor Gil Scott-Heron, who died in 2011, and is now sorely missed.

Mariusz Kwiecien sings Belcore, Nemorino’s swaggering rival, and Ambrogio Maestri is the potion-peddling salesman Doctor Dulcamara. Maurizio Benini conducted and Bartlett Sher directed this “Great Performances at the Met” presentation, which Anthony Tommasini, writing in The New York Times, called handsome and insightful. “The production’s contemporary element comes from showing the main characters engaged in a triangle of desire, distrust and gamesmanship,” he said, adding: “In her village Adina is like a prima donna, something Ms. Netrebko easily conveys.” And Mr. Polenzani “is coming into his prime.”8 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/world/middleeast/israeli-candidates-make-their-cases-on-tv.html,"HERZLIYA, Israel — On the set here this week of Israel’s most popular political television satire show, a character impersonating Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stood by a large map of the region as he drew a system of fences, spiked barriers and security doors around Israel’s borders. He then slapped a sign over the country that read, “Do Not Disturb.”The skit, typical fare for “Eretz Nehederet” (“A Wonderful Country”), was a humorous retort during this election season, when Israelis are hit with a concentrated burst of political television. Under the rules of Israel’s idiosyncratic system, the 34 parties running in the election are barred from buying television time, but are entitled to seven minutes of free airtime on each of the three main television channels.They also get an extra two minutes for every seat the party holds in the Knesset, or Parliament. For the prime minister’s ticket, this means an hour and a half of free airtime in the two weeks before the Jan. 22 ballot.“Our enemies are big — and brown,” said the caricatured prime minister as he pointed on the map to the shaded area representing Iran, spoofing the kind of campaigns many here consider ill suited to addressing the urgent issues facing the next government.In his own commercials, the prime minister boasts of achievements — like completing a fence along the border with Egypt, and bringing down cellphone costs. As Israel’s election campaign heads into its final leg, the nightly blocks of state-financed party broadcasts are aimed largely at the fifth or quarter of the electorate that pollsters say remains undecided. A mainstay of Israeli campaigns since television arrived here in the 1960s, the commercials have ranged from the fright-inducing (Mr. Netanyahu’s footage of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad of Iran) to the bizarre (an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who pledges bread for a shekel, or 27 cents).On the first night, the broadcasts went on for 75 minutes, though they more typically run for about half an hour.Yet in a campaign devoid of American-style televised debates, Israelis are increasingly questioning whether the television broadcasts — which are the core of the campaigns — still have any relevance.“Like a scorching interrogation in the dungeons of the Securitate, I was also ready to confess to anything,” wrote Itay Segel, a television critic for the popular newspaper Yediot Aharonot, after the first night. “The election propaganda, as always, convinces the convinced and bores the bored.”Candidates also use social media, go on widely publicized pub crawls, visit markets and attend parlor meetings and discussion panels. But very often — and with greater impact — they find themselves the subject of sarcasm, appearing as puppets or in the form of actors impersonating them on satire shows.In a country where the satirists say it is hard to compete with the political reality, more than twice the percentage of households in Israel watch “Eretz Nehederet,” produced for Channel 2 by the Keshet media group, than tune in to the official election broadcasts.“There is no doubt that the entertainment shows have more influence than the broadcasts,” said Yuval Karniel, an expert in communications at the Interdisciplinary Center in Herzliya. “The broadcasts are redundant; there is nothing like them in the Western world.”Embodying the quirkiness of the system, a dour-looking man in his mid-50s, Ofer Lifshitz, has been appearing on television each night to drum up support for his party, the Everlasting Covenant for the Salvation of Israel.His message: “Nine years ago the Holy One Blessed Be He sent me to save the people of Israel who have been enslaved and persecuted by Israeli governments for generations.”Mr. Lifshitz’s little-known party is unlikely to gain enough votes to pass the electoral threshold. Previous incarnations of the Everlasting Covenant, which used to advocate for a separation of state and religion and now calls for a constitution based on the Torah, did not. Still, Mr. Lifshitz, along with the Pirates Party and the Green Leaf-Liberal List, is allocated the same airtime as Yesh Atid (There is a Future), a recently formed centrist party led by a former television host, Yair Lapid, that is widely predicted to become a coalition partner in the next government.The campaign broadcasts are a throwback to the days when Israel had only one, state-owned television channel. To ensure fairness, politicians were banned from the screen for two months before an election other than in the regulated blocks of campaign commercials.Watching them was a ritual in the days when viewers had nowhere else to go, and in the 1970s and ’80s, they had ratings of up to 90 percent. But public interest has waned greatly. Over the past week, an average of about 16 percent of households tuned in.Other than giving exposure to small and new parties and possibly influencing a few wavering voters, the impact of the television campaign is minimal, experts say. “It doesn’t influence the public or media agenda at all,” said Gabriel Weimann, a professor at the University of Haifa who has studied the issue. “But only the Knesset can abolish it, and since it gives the politicians free access to our television sets, why give it up?”The two main commercial channels are now obligated to run the campaign broadcasts free of charge. In a small concession to modernity, the Knesset’s Central Elections Committee has cut the television campaign period from three weeks to two and no longer forces the channels to show the broadcasts at prime time.Likud-Beiteinu’s videos have focused on Mr. Netanyahu the statesman, addressing the world from the halls of the United Nations and Congress, and standing by a map in his office pledging to cover all of Israel with the Iron Dome anti-rocket missile system, to fence Israel in on all its borders and to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. The panoramic shots of Jerusalem always manage to omit the landmark Muslim shrines.Shelly Yacimovich, the leader of the center-left Labor Party, tried to soften her image in her election broadcasts with a scene from her kitchen, where she showed off a freezer stocked with plastic containers of homemade chicken soup. Ms. Yacimovich has been criticized by some traditional Labor supporters for focusing solely on socioeconomic issues and not taking a stand, for example, against settlement construction in the West Bank.On the set in Herzliya, her “Eretz Nehederet” counterpart, Helly, an abrasive, overbearing character, threw whole, unpeeled vegetables into a pot as she expounded on the best way to freeze schnitzels as opposed to freezing settlements.The new star of this season of “Eretz Nehederet” is Naftali Bennett, the leader of the rightist Jewish Home Party, which has been climbing in the polls. He appears as a computer-generated wild, messianic settler who is made to look like an appealing guy-next-door, but whose intrinsic extremism keeps slipping out.Apparently gratified at having made it onto the show, the real Mr. Bennett posted a picture of his slightly crazed “Eretz Nehederet” character on his Facebook page.“As citizens we often cry while writing our comedy,” said Muli Segev, the chief producer of “Eretz Nehederet.” “The reality is very depressing. Campaigns here are always about everything but what is going to happen.”"

Its current offering, Rossini’s “Gazza Ladra,” a frothy Italian comedy, will be performed in English translation. The story concerns a young woman, a servant in the house of a well-off farmer, who is engaged to her employer’s son until she is accused of stealing a silver spoon. Complications ensue. Mr. Spierman conducts the remaining performances in a production directed by Benjamin Spierman, his son.

(Anthony Tommasini)★ ‘Maria Stuarda’ (Saturday and Wednesday) In its first production of this elegant tragedy by Donizetti, the Metropolitan Opera wisely cast the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato in the title role of Mary, Queen of Scots. Her affecting performance demonstrates the art of singing at its best. In an auspicious Met debut, the dynamic soprano Elza van den Heever sings Queen Elizabeth, Mary’s nemesis and rival for the affections of the Earl of Leicester, sung here with ardor and style by the tenor Matthew Polenzani. David McVicar uses bold colors and stark imagery to bring a touch of the contemporary to an otherwise traditional staging. Maurizio Benini conducts a supple account of a great Donizetti score. Saturday’s performance, at 1 p.m., is an HD live broadcast to movie theaters; also on Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org; $30 to $495. (Tommasini)★ ‘The Play of Daniel’ (Friday through Sunday) The first New York production of this shining medieval liturgical drama at the Cloisters in 1958 was a landmark in the city’s embrace of early music. In 2008 the work was brought back in a new production, produced by Gotham Early Music Scene and directed by Drew Minter, with a musical edition by Mary Anne Ballard, that is now being revived in the austere Fuentidueña Chapel. The singers and musicians are very fine, the production simple and lovely, and the experience of one of opera’s earliest precursors is a rare treat.

(Zachary Woolfe)★ ‘La Rondine’ (Friday and Tuesday) The Metropolitan Opera has brought back its vibrant 2008 production of Puccini’s “Rondine.” The big news is the house debut of the fast-rising Latvian soprano Kristine Opolais as Magda, the dreamy, elegant mistress of a wealthy Parisian banker. An affecting actress, Ms. Opolais has a plush voice with a throbbing richness that lends a touch of poignancy to every phrase she sings. As Ruggero, the young newcomer to Paris who falls for Magda, the tenor Giuseppe Filianoti sings with melting sound and Italianate style, marred by moments of vocal shakiness. Ion Marin conducts a glowing account of a wonderful, overlooked Puccini score. At 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org; $20 to $430.

The show now returns for its final performances with some better known, very capable singers, including Patricia Racette and Stephanie Blythe, who are joined by Marco Berti and Alexey Markov. The propulsive conductor, as before, is Daniele Callegari. Saturday at 8 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Metropolitan Opera House, Lincoln Center, (212) 362-6000, metoperafamily.org; $20 to $450.

On Saturday two notable young musicians, the pianist Michael Brown and the violinist Arnaud Sussmann, join forces for music by Janacek, Prokofiev, Debussy and Strauss. On Sunday the pianist Jeffrey Swann continues his exploration of the complete Beethoven sonatas, offering Opus 26, 109 and 54, with onstage commentary.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/spare-times-for-children-for-jan-18-24.html,"‘ERTH’S DINOSAUR ZOO’It’s certainly friendlier than Jurassic Park.“Erth’s Dinosaur Zoo,” at the New Victory Theater, brings together fun-loving Australians and seemingly fun-loving giant reptiles. While it’s doubtful that even a small dinosaur would respond to kissing noises or a little girl’s tender hugs, this behavior can be forgiven as obligatory hokum to engage young audiences. Where its subjects’ appearance, movement and life cycles are concerned, “Erth’s Dinosaur Zoo” delivers solid science as well as an extraordinary spectacle.I was initially skeptical. Erth, a troupe based in Sydney, works with puppets, and how could they compare to Hollywood’s animatronic and computer-generated beasts? But the puppets convince brilliantly, even when their skilled operators are visible. In addition to surface details — the Tyrannosaurus rex has feathers, reflecting the latest theories — the puppets have movable eyelids. The company invites theatergoers to encounter the creatures close-up after the show, and nothing captivates (or unnerves) quite like a blinking eye.With Scott Wright, the company’s enthusiastic artistic director, as M.C. — he may remind you of the much-missed television host Steve Irwin — “Dinosaur Zoo” embarks on a 50-minute prehistoric tour. It begins in starry outer space, like a planetarium show (Steve Howarth is the production designer) and goes on to introduce marine reptiles like the plesiosaurs. You also meet the meganeura, a gigantic insect that lived long before dinosaurs and literally ate on the fly.Mr. Wright knows how to entertain children, and he gleefully goes for the gross-out detail — dinosaurs fed their babies by vomiting — as well as Vegas-style showmanship: the T. rex and an Australovenator wintonensis fight to the sounds of boxing-round bells and rock music. He also brings children onstage, whether it’s to pet infant herbivores or to interact with less cuddly carnivores like the Australovenator, above with Mr. Wright and an audience member. (Don’t take little ones; an unflappable preschooler is an oxymoron.)Of course adults have their qualms too. At a recent show for schoolchildren Mr. Wright led one teacher onstage and asked her to raise a fist. When the meganeura, its two sets of 33-inch-long wings furiously beating, landed on it, she looked up and screamed. Now that’s a field trip.(Through Jan. 27 at 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, 646-223-3010, newvictory.org. Fridays at 7 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m. and 3 and 7 p.m.; Sundays and this Monday at 11 a.m. and 3 p.m.; $14 to $38; $9 to $25 for members.) LAUREL GRAEBERFor Children‘The Adventures of Maya the Bee’ (Saturday) This feisty puppet heroine has buzzed back to the Culture Project, where her journey began a dozen years ago. Based on a children’s book by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, “The Adventures of Maya the Bee” relates the title character’s flight from the hive in search of tastes more exotic than honey. The revival has new sets and props, but the same intricate rod and shadow puppets designed by Zofia Czechlewska. Adapted by Rachel Klein, with a score and lyrics by the jazz artist Nancy Harrow, who also conceived the show, “Maya” is a jazz musical for children, and how often do you encounter those? (The run is open-ended.) Saturdays at 10:30 a.m., 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org; $25.‘All Aboard With Thomas and Friends’ (Friday through Thursday) In winter the New York Botanical Garden becomes as much a train station as a plant-filled paradise.

Father Goose, a master of Caribbean sounds and a species unto himself, will perform two concerts. Noon to 4 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays and to 4 p.m. on Fridays; the museum is closed on Martin Luther King’s Birthday; 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

This question frequently comes to mind when viewing the complex animation in some of today’s films, and now the Museum of the Moving Image offers visitors an answer for one of those movies: “Rise of the Guardians,” a recent DreamWorks release. This new exhibition consists of more than 25 original drawings and sketches, along with design materials, production artifacts and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film, an adventure about immortal heroes like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy.

The vocalist Gilberto Santa Rosa will also participate in the event, which includes pieces by Tito Puente and Horace Silver. At 2 p.m.; preconcert activities start at 1 p.m.; Isaac Stern Auditorium, (212) 247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $9, $15 and $20.Central Park Conservancy Ice Festival (Saturday) Castles normally take quite a while to build, but the one taking shape in Central Park this weekend will require just a few hours. Two sculptors from Okamoto Studio will wield chisels, chain saws and ice picks to carve a 5-foot-by-4-foot block of ice into a facsimile of Belvedere Castle. This demonstration will be the centerpiece of the annual Ice Festival, which will include talks on the Belvedere site’s history (going back to the glacial period) and tours of the landscape and castle (the real one, that is).

For the Piccolini Trio, the answer is easy: put on the show yourself. These three clowns do so in the revival of this production, which signals the reopening of the Canal Park Playhouse after extensive damage during Hurricane Sandy. Part of the Classic Brunch Matinee Series at the playhouse, it includes acrobatics, juggling, slapstick and music. (Through Jan. 27.)

At 11 a.m., 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $7.‘Flight of the Butterflies’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to think of the graceful creatures that are the subject of this fascinating film as traveling only short distances, flitting from flower to flower. But half a billion monarch butterflies actually migrate 3,000 miles every fall, from Canada to Mexico. A new Imax movie, this project chronicles their journey and the 40-year investigation of it by one impassioned scientist, Fred A. Urquhart. (Through July 7.)

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/television/lance-armstrong-interview-with-oprah-winfrey-lacked-emotion.html,"“I view this situation as one big lie that I repeated a lot of times” is how Lance Armstrong neatly summed up the doping scandal that stripped him of his seven Tour de France titles and sank his career. And he made that confession to Oprah Winfrey on Thursday with startling equanimity. He may have been nervous, but he didn’t look uncomfortable. Armstrong appeared as reasoned and dispassionate telling the truth as he did all those years that he so fluently and convincingly spun a lie.Armstrong described his situation now as a “process,” and it was hard not to see his candor as just another step in a new battle, not for victory, but for containing loss. He touched his face, which is often a tell. But he said all the right things, with surprising ease. Then again, rigor and focused self-discipline are his trademarks.“People who believed in me and believed me have every right to feel betrayed,” he said earnestly but not emotionally. “I will spend the rest of my life trying to earn back trust and apologize to people.”Armstrong said what had to be said (“all the fault and all the blame falls on me”), but the interview was strangely low on energy and emotion. Candor is not the same as catharsis. His confession wasn’t just about sports — it was supposed to be a watershed moment of love lost and betrayal.Winfrey, who split the interview over two nights to help her struggling cable channel, OWN, did her best to get answers, but she didn’t get all of them, and she didn’t pierce his armor. Armstrong isn’t just an athlete who lied about drug use; he was the cheating cad in one of the great American love stories. For men at least, Armstrong was, up until his free fall, one of the most romantic figures since another Armstrong, Neil, walked on the moon in 1969.There are other sports heroes. But Armstrong was a New World star in the European sport of cycling whose improbable comeback story defied the odds and blunted the cynicism of the age: he was struck by testicular cancer at 25 and went on to beat Europe’s best in the Tour de France seven years in a row — and also fathered five children, three with his first wife and two with his current girlfriend, Anna Hansen. He dated Sheryl Crow and Tory Burch, and while he wasn’t known for his pleasing personality, his goodness seemed unimpeachable thanks to his foundation, Livestrong, one of the country’s biggest cancer charities.Armstrong said he was caught up in his own myth and explained that after surviving cancer, he was “ruthlessly” determined to win at all costs. He threw in some family back story of childhood hardship, just enough to give his aggressive campaign to discredit truth tellers a mitigating context, without turning mawkish. He admitted with a rueful smile to being a bully but said he never directly instructed teammates to take performance-enhancing drugs. There was a ghostly trace of boyish charm when he said things like “I’m not the most believable guy in the world, I understand that, but I did not do that.”He did admit to taking performance-enhancing drugs, saying he saw it as necessary, “like air in my tires.” He stopped short of saying that everybody did it, but did say that many, many others did the same, and he felt no guilt because he thought he was merely making “a level playing field.”But when the questions veered to his behavior toward other people, including friends he betrayed and colleagues he calumniated, he talked about himself almost in the second person, distancing himself from the man he was before the interview took place.When Winfrey asked him rather incredulously how he could attack and sue people who he knew were telling the truth, Armstrong described it as a “major flaw” in the character of “a guy who expected to get whatever he wanted, and to control every outcome.” He called that behavior “inexcusable.”Yet he admitted that he didn’t feel guilty or torn at the time. “No, that was the scariest part.” Actually, the scariest part was that as he was setting the record straight, he seemed the same as when he was distorting it beyond belief."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/arts/television/robert-f-chew-actor-on-the-wire-dies-at-52.html,"Robert F. Chew, an actor best known for his roles in gritty HBO dramas like “The Corner” and “The Wire,” died on Thursday at his home in Baltimore. He was 52.The cause was a heart attack, said his sister, Clarice Chew.Mr. Chew was a well-regarded stage actor when he began appearing in television shows created by or based on the work of David Simon and Edward Burns. He played a shoe salesman on “The Corner” and the drug supplier Wilkie Collins on the NBC drama “Homicide: Life on the Street.”As Proposition Joe Stewart, the portly, deeply connected and relatively civil drug kingpin on “The Wire,” he preferred to broker deals between rival drug factions rather than resort to violence.“We were looking for somebody that was sensible and even paternal, as almost a foil to the rest of the brutality and ambition that you were seeing in that underground economy,” Mr. Simon said on Friday. “So you needed him to be incredibly human, funny, connected to whoever’s in the room, and yet he’s a gangster.”He recalled one scene in which Mr. Chew used four different voices while calling a telephone number that turns out to be that of Baltimore’s homicide unit. “He becomes four different characters before your eyes,” Mr. Simon said. “It was a soliloquy of pure acting.”Robert Francell Chew was born on Dec. 28, 1960, in Baltimore. He graduated from Patterson Park High School and then studied music at Morgan State University.Mr. Chew acted in plays all over the country and taught young actors at Baltimore’s Arena Players for many years.In addition to his sister, Mr. Chew is survived by two other sisters, Tanya Chew and Maureen Little; and his mother, Henrietta Chew."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/hockey/martin-brodeur-of-devils-eager-to-lead-team-again.html,"NEWARK — When the Devils made a stunning march to the Stanley Cup finals last season after finishing sixth in the Eastern Conference, they inadvertently breathed new life into the career of goaltender Martin Brodeur.“I sat back after the run and said, ‘Wow, I’m going to miss this if I decide not to re-sign,’ ” said the 40-year-old Brodeur, who agreed to a two-year deal in July worth $9 million.Two years ago, Brodeur first began pondering retirement, he said. The Devils began that season 9-22-2 before Coach John MacLean was fired. They made a belated charge under the interim coach Jacques Lemaire but missed the playoffs for the first time since the 1995-96 season, finishing 4th in the Atlantic Division and 11th in the conference.“Hockey wasn’t really enjoyable,” said Brodeur, who stood tall when the Devils won the Stanley Cup in 1995, 2000 and 2003. “I’m not used to being on losing teams.”The self-doubt that crept in as he compiled a 23-26 record with a 2.45 goals-against average only added to his malaise. For the first time since he won the Calder Trophy as rookie of the year in 1993-94, Brodeur began to wonder if he was part of the problem, after being the solution for so long.“When the team is not doing well and you can’t do anything about it — you’re playing hard, and nothing is going on — you question yourself a little bit,” said Brodeur, a 10-time All-Star.Although the Devils lost to the Los Angeles Kings in six games in last year’s Stanley Cup finals, the seemingly magical playoff run past the Florida Panthers in seven games, the Philadelphia Flyers in five games and the archrival Rangers in six games emphatically answered any such questioning Brodeur might have done. A winner of the Vezina Trophy four times as the N.H.L.’s outstanding goaltender, he proved to be as resurgent as his team.“I felt like when I was 25,” he said.He has continued to not act his age — he turns 41 on May 6 — since the Devils returned for a six-day training camp before their 48-game schedule begins on the road Saturday against the Islanders. According to Elias Sports Bureau, Brodeur will be the third-oldest player in the N.H.L. this season, behind Teemu Selanne, 42, of the Anaheim Ducks and Jaromir Jagr of the Dallas Stars, who turns 41 next month.“He’s an amazing athlete,” said Coach Peter DeBoer, who is entering his second season with the Devils. “He’s the most enthusiastic guy on the ice, and he’s going on 41 years old. That’s contagious.”Entering his 20th season with the Devils, Brodeur seemingly has little left to accomplish, and certainly nothing left to prove. He helped Canada bring home a gold medal at the 2002 Olympic Winter Games. He holds N.H.L. records for regular-season wins (656) and shutouts (119). And yet, after playing 70,028 minutes and appearing in 1,191 games, Brodeur is spurring on teammates almost two decades younger.“He loves to compete, even at his age,” center Travis Zajac, 27, said. “He loves coming on the ice, stopping us and letting us know he stopped us.”As Johan Hedberg, an effective complement to Brodeur in net, sees it, attitude is almost everything.“To be able to stay at this level when you get older, you need enthusiasm or you get out of the game way earlier,” Hedberg said.Brodeur was a mainstay when the Devils used a 48-game schedule as a springboard to their first Stanley Cup, in 1994-95. Because of the mix of accomplished veterans and rising young players on the current roster, Brodeur again sees delicious possibilities, despite the free-agency loss of the team captain Zach Parise, a force on offense.“I always love to play the game,” Brodeur said. “But when you see potential, for sure it’s exciting.”Much, of course, will depend on Brodeur’s ability to provide his usual nerveless consistency.“I’d like to play a lot of games, because it is a short season,” he said. “The playoffs will come quickly, and if we do get in, you want to be as sharp as you can.”With the Devils scheduled to play on consecutive days nine times, DeBoer will probably split those between his two goalies. He said he did not have a plan for how the rest of the starts would be managed.Another key question for Brodeur involves how much longer he will play.“I signed for two, so I’m going to honor those two and see if somebody else wants me after,” he said, sounding as if the end were nowhere near."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/hockey/penguins-sidney-crosby-healthy-and-eager-as-nhl-season-begins.html,"PITTSBURGH — At the Pittsburgh Penguins’ open scrimmage Wednesday, more than 18,000 fans filled Consol Energy Center after lining up for hours outside. Club officials opened the arena’s luxury boxes to accommodate the overflow, but they still had to turn people away.On the ice, Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin, two of the best players in the world, swooped in on the power play, setting it in motion like a giant clockwork mechanism while the crowd roared in delight. This was what the fans had desired through almost four months of a lockout — N.H.L. hockey, with all its skill and passion.Excitement reigns through much of the league as a condensed 48-game season begins Saturday. The question of whether fans will come back after the league’s third lockout since 1994 may have been answered by the crowds at free open practices and scrimmages held during brief training camps: 6,500 in St. Louis, 10,000 in Buffalo, 12,000 in Vancouver, 13,000 in Minnesota, 15,000 in Philadelphia, 17,000 in Montreal, 18,000 in Pittsburgh.Most of those fans turned out before the N.H.L. bought full-page newspaper ads in every league city Thursday to apologize for the lockout.Other questions will take longer to answer. Will Rick Nash’s scoring provide the Rangers with the last piece of a Stanley Cup puzzle? Was the Los Angeles Kings’ run to last year’s Cup a fluke, or can they become the first repeat champions since the Detroit Red Wings in 1998? Can the Devils, the defending Eastern Conference champions, survive without Zach Parise, who signed with the Minnesota Wild? Will the Edmonton Oilers’ multitude of young stars revive memories of Wayne Gretzky, Jari Kurri and Mark Messier? And, of course, will the Toronto Maple Leafs go a 46th consecutive year without a Cup?But the most important question in this season’s sprint to the Stanley Cup is a familiar one: Has Crosby fully recovered from the series of concussions that limited him to 22 regular-season games and 6 playoff games since Jan. 1, 2011?He says yes.“I feel good,” Crosby said. “I had a great summer. I was able to train and push myself. It’s much nicer not to think about it.”It has been a long wait. He signed a 12-year, $104.4 million contract extension in June, took an active union role during the lockout, even played goalie for a ball hockey game in a Pittsburgh recreational league. Through it all, he said his symptoms did not return.Last season Crosby, 25, played eight games in his initial return in November, but he experienced symptoms again and missed three more months. He finished with 37 points in 22 games but was never 100 percent.Asked whether he was always worrying that the symptoms would return, he said: “Probably a little bit — not to the point where I changed the way I played or anything like that. That’s human nature when you go through something for that long. You probably do double-check after you get a hit.”Crosby and the Penguins will open the season Saturday afternoon in Philadelphia for a reprise of last spring’s brawl-filled playoff series against the Flyers, which included a fight between Crosby and Claude Giroux. Philadelphia fans tend to hate Crosby, and he said he was looking forward to returning to the Flyers’ rink.“It’s going to be great to be thrown into that really early,” Crosby said. “It’s been that way there since my first year. Those are fun games.”Still, Crosby has not played a real game since last year’s first-round loss to the Flyers, so the concussion question will linger.Questions of game fitness are facing players across the league. The emerging consensus is that those who joined teams in Europe during the lockout are in far better shape than those who skated informally at home.“The guys that have played hockey games have a significant advantage over those who have not played for months and months and months,” Penguins Coach Dan Bylsma said.Malkin, last season’s most valuable player with 50 goals and a league-leading 109 points, is razor-sharp after spending the lockout in the Kontinental Hockey League with his hometown club, Metallurg Magnitogorsk. He was No. 2 in K.H.L. scoring when the lockout ended, with 23 goals and 65 points in 37 games.“He looks unbelievable if you ask me,” Malkin’s teammate Pascal Dupuis said. “He did last year, so I’m glad he kept playing over there.”Malkin, who had major surgery on his right knee in 2011, said he was in good shape. “Nothing is sore,” he said.That bodes well for the roughly 200 players who went overseas during the lockout, like the Islanders’ John Tavares, the Boston Bruins’ Tyler Seguin, the Montreal Canadiens’ Tomas Plekanec and the Devils’ Ilya Kovalchuk, all of whom excelled with their European clubs.It may also bode ill for teams like the Vancouver Canucks, the Presidents’ Trophy winners last year for having the best regular-season record. Only three Vancouver players competed in Europe during the lockout.Dr. Robert S. Gotlin, the director of orthopedic and sports rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center, said the N.B.A. saw a significant rise in muscle pulls and in ankle and hamstring injuries after its lockout last season.“Practicing is not the same as game conditions for a player, physically or mentally,” Gotlin, a former doctor for the Knicks, said. “Those who just practiced will be more prone to injuries.”Canucks forward David Booth is expected to miss four to six weeks after a groin pull at training camp. That is a long time in a 99-day regular season. Still, teams will be playing only one extra game per month under the condensed schedule, and travel will be reduced with no games against out-of-conference opponents.But players agree it will be more intense.“I really can’t wait for this to get started,” Crosby said. “I’m ready. We’re all ready.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/movies/kyle-patrick-alvarez-films-cog-by-david-sedaris.html,"PARK CITY, Utah — David Sedaris has never allowed Hollywood to get its paws on his writing.Well, there was one flirtation with film. About a decade ago Mr. Sedaris started work on a movie adaptation of “Me Talk Pretty One Day,” his first best-selling collection of humorous essays. But he quickly halted it after his sister Lisa worried that someone fat would portray her. Since then, he said in a telephone interview from London, “It just became an automatic no.”How, then, did a 29-year-old director named Kyle Patrick Alvarez, with a tiny budget and only one movie under his belt (a phone sex drama at that), get Mr. Sedaris to let him bring one of his works to the screen?The answer involves a little of Mr. Alvarez’s pluck in getting his proposal to the author, and a lot of Mr. Sedaris’s quirkiness in deciding to trust him.Mr. Alvarez, a passionate fan of Mr. Sedaris’s offbeat essays, had long wanted to adapt “C.O.G.,” a fish-out-of-water tale that finds a young Mr. Sedaris working on an apple farm in the Pacific Northwest. The story, which also involves an overly friendly forklift operator with an unusual hobby and a born-again Christian who carves rocks into Oregon-shaped clocks, comes from “Naked,” Mr. Sedaris’s 1997 collection of essays.“I saw it as dark and funny and a chance to hopefully make something special,” Mr. Alvarez said. “It’s also not about his family, which made me think I had a shot at getting him to say yes.”But Mr. Alvarez had already been rebuffed by Mr. Sedaris’s agents. So he started to brainstorm.Mr. Alvarez’s first feature, “Easier With Practice,” a 2009 drama about an introverted writer who has a lot of phone sex, was based on a GQ article written by Davy Rothbart. Mr. Rothbart is a contributor to “This American Life,” a Public Radio International show heard on many National Public Radio radio stations on which Mr. Sedaris is also a regular. So Mr. Alvarez decided to attend one of Mr. Sedaris’s book signings and use the connection to press his case. “All he could say was no, right?” he said.Mr. Alvarez, who started out in Hollywood as an assistant to Warren Beatty after graduating from the University of Miami, brought along a DVD of “Easier With Practice,” and mentioned the movie idea. Mr. Sedaris was polite, he said, but didn’t offer much hope. Still, Mr. Alvarez followed up with a letter to Mr. Sedaris sent through NPR back channels.A few months later, back at home in Europe, Mr. Sedaris found himself with nothing to do one night. “I thought: ‘Oh, right. There’s that movie that guy gave me,’ ” he said. That is pretty much all it took.“I go to the movies a lot, and I often feel like the script is the last thing on anyone’s mind,” Mr. Sedaris added. “But I really liked what Kyle did. It was such a mysterious little movie.”Mr. Sedaris sent Mr. Alvarez an e-mail — subject line: “Your excellent movie” — and the budding director soon had the literary heavyweight’s approval. “I guess I just really liked Kyle,” Mr. Sedaris said. “He’s adorable, isn’t he?“C.O.G.” will have its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival here on Sunday. It stars Jonathan Groff, a Tony Award nominee for Broadway’s “Spring Awakening” who is perhaps best known for his role on “Glee.” The supporting cast includes the character actors Corey Stoll (Hemingway in “Midnight in Paris”) and Denis O’Hare (“American Horror Story”).“I think the performances in it are really, really special,” said Trevor Groth, Sundance’s programming chief. “With beloved source material comes great advantages — people are immediately interested — but also immense pressure. And Kyle pulled it off.”Mr. Sedaris, who said he planned to attend the premiere, may be the biggest “get” of this year’s festival, given his long cinematic standoffishness. But he is not the only marquee name generating buzz here after deciding to participate. Every year a handful of industrious producers and directors manage to snare cooperation that makes the rest of the movie industry stop and stare.Playing this year’s festival, for instance, is a documentary about Anita Hill, who has long declined filmmakers’ requests to revisit her incendiary testimony from the 1991 Senate confirmation hearings for Associate Justice Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court. But Ms. Hill, now a professor at Brandeis University, finally said yes to the documentarian Frieda Mock, who made the Academy Award-winning film “Maya Lin: A Strong Clear Vision.”“I’ve always said no, but I finally took it on faith that it would be an honest portrayal,” said Ms. Hill, who traveled here for the premiere of “Anita.” (Her film is playing in the same category as “The World According to Dick Cheney”; Mr. Cheney also participated fully in his documentary, but is skipping Sundance, a spokeswoman for the filmmakers said.)Mr. Alvarez made “C.O.G.” in 18 days, shooting on location near Portland, Ore., on a budget of less than $1 million.Mr. Sedaris said he had not seen the film or even read the screenplay, even though Mr. Alvarez offered him full approval over the adaptation.“I’ve never wanted to make a movie, so approving a script was something I didn’t want, either,” Mr. Sedaris said. “Either you give permission or you don’t, and then you step back.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/arts/dane-cook-a-changeable-comedian.html,"In his first television special Dane Cook charged onstage wearing a black tank top and crouched like a giant frog aiming to catch a fly. “I think every comic wants to be a rock ’n’ roll star,” he said in that 2000 show. “I do. That’s my dream.”Seven years later it came true. Running around a stage at Madison Square Garden was a new version of Mr. Cook. Gone was the clownish, Jim Carrey-like physicality, replaced by a preening strut. “This is like a party here tonight, you feel it, right?” he shouted. They did.Watching his young crowd roar in laughter at jokes that, to put it generously, varied in quality, makes you understand why Steve Martin soured on comedy after playing arenas. In an environment that resembles a boy-band concert, how can a comic know what’s working? If they laugh at everything, is it still funny?How Dane Cook, now 40, became one of the biggest names in stand-up (with almost three million Twitter followers) is only slightly less baffling than how he has become one of the most reviled. A moderately talented, hard-working performer with an obnoxious streak, he has an ordinary frat-boy exterior that hides an energetic juggernaut of ambition and drive.Mr. Cook may have been the first Internet-age comic. He pioneered the exploitation of social media to build a career, consistently responding to fans on MySpace when that service mattered. “It was unheard-of then to use it like he did,” said Patrick Milligan, who helps run the club the Stand, near Gramercy Park.While the Internet can build popularity quickly, it can also accelerate a backlash. When Mr. Cook made a joke about the Aurora, Colo., shootings, it went viral, and he was forced to apologize. When he performed new material earlier in 2012, T. J. Miller, a comic on the same bill at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, tweeted criticism. The media picked it up, leading each comic to argue his case on podcasts.In certain comedy and media circles, contempt for Mr. Cook is knee-jerk, even cliché. At Joe’s Pub in the East Village, I once saw Benjamin Walker, an actor who dabbles in comedy, announce that he didn’t want to be like Mr. Cook. Hating Dane Cook is a kind of credential-building shorthand. Andrew Dice Clay was once even more controversial. But unlike Mr. Cook, he emerged before the Internet, and his persona has remained relatively constant. His New Year’s Eve Showtime special shows him to be basically the same proudly crass, nursery-rhyming comic who rocketed to fame in the 1990s.Mr. Cook, by contrast, evolves. His early material was exuberantly silly. He did a long bit about wanting to be a snake. He showed traces of self-deprecation. His best album, from 2003, is “Harmful if Swallowed,” and it included jokes about working at Burger King, which in an attempt to make a terrible job sound better he referred to as “the BK Lounge.”In some of the loosely organized stories on his next album, “Retaliation,” he captured the amusing ways that a thin-skinned guy avoids honesty. There were even hints of vulnerability in the manner of Martin Lawrence. But Mr. Cook’s macho persona also resorted to cheap laughs through dumb sexual boasts and imagined violence. He was never self-aware enough to be insightful, but his committed, relentlessly upbeat charisma and ambition had a certain brute force.As he grew more famous, the vulnerability faded, and his persona turned smug. This hurt him more than it would other comics because the strength of his act lies in his force of personality, not carefully wrought jokes. Once he started chuckling over the imagined prospect of harming a girl he had gotten pregnant, part of his appeal evaporated. Boy bands carefully protect their images for a reason.He starred in some brutally reviewed movies like “Good Luck Chuck.” Accusations of joke stealing emerged. These dogged him and became the subject of a scene in the television series “Louie.” Louis C. K., who wrote the episode, asks a grumpy Mr. Cook for a favor, which leads to an argument over whether Mr. Cook stole his jokes. Mr. Cook says he didn’t. Louis C. K. says that he believes he did, albeit unintentionally.The scene is less balanced than it appears. The controversy focused on three jokes. At worst, Mr. Cook used similar premises to create markedly different bits from Louis C. K.’s. If employing the same premise is the standard for theft, countless comics would be guilty.But comparing these jokes makes you realize that the premises make less of an impact than what is done with them. One of the jokes in question marvels at how parents could name their children anything. Mr. Cook thinks of naming his kid after the transformer Optimus Prime, while Louis C. K. takes a more imaginative tack, proposing the expression “Ladies and gentleman,” so, when exasperated, he could say, “Ladies and gentleman, please!”Mr. Cook’s last album of new material, the 2009 “Isolated Incident,” introduced another persona that’s more sober, confessional. He begins with a rare topical joke about President Obama’s name. Where he once did a bit about talking a woman into sex even though he didn’t have a condom, he now jokes about turning down sex because there’s no birth control. In the Comedy Central special based on this album, he enters the stage quietly, the camera behind him, through an unglamorous backstage.Other comics are as desperate for success as Mr. Cook, but they hide it better. He didn’t just wear that black tank top; at the end of his 2000 special he ripped it off, raising his hands in triumph. Inevitably, Mr. Cook has tried to leverage his toxic reputation by playing jerks, but it’s not so easy. He was an obnoxious D.J. in a pilot of the sitcom “Next Caller,” but NBC chose not to broadcast the show in October, even though several episodes had been filmed.The previous year he was to play a sexist cad in Neil LaBute’s “Fat Pig” on Broadway, but the financing fell apart. Last month he was given another chance at television: NBC signed a new deal with him. But tellingly, the only role that has worked out for him lately is that of a Nazi.Playing that goose-stepping playwright, Franz Liebkind, in a short run of “The Producers” in Los Angeles last summer, Mr. Cook was surprisingly good, better than Will Ferrell in the movie version. His singing was solid, and his jittery clowning loose-limbed and aptly silly. His well-reviewed turn was a reminder of his early stand-up: goofy, brazenly broad, selling it.It’s a performance that made you believe that there’s one way that Mr. Cook has not changed. More than anything, he still wants to be a rock star."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/health/flu-season-worse-than-average-officials-say.html,"This year’s flu season is shaping up to be “worse than average and particularly bad for the elderly,” Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, the nation’s top federal disease-control official, said Friday.But the season appears to have peaked, added Dr. Frieden, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with new cases declining over most of the nation except for the far West.Spot shortages of flu vaccine and flu-fighting medicine are occurring, but that reflects uneven distribution, not a supply crisis, federal officials said. They urged people seeking flu shots to consult flu.gov and doctors to check preventinfluenza.org for suppliers.Vaccine makers will ultimately be able to deliver 145 million doses, 10 million more than projected earlier, the officials said. The Food and Drug Administration has allowed the maker of Tamiflu to release two million doses it had in storage.The older Tamiflu is perfectly good, said Dr. Margaret A. Hamburg, the commissioner of the F.D.A., who joined Dr. Frieden in a telephone news conference. “It’s not outdated, it just has older labeling,” Dr. Hamburg said. “Repackaging it would take weeks,” she added, so her agency told the company not to bother.Weekly recorded deaths from flu and pneumonia are still rising, and are well above the “epidemic” curve for the first time. But how severe a season ultimately proves depends on how long high weekly death rates persist. Flu deaths often are not recorded until March or April, well after new infections taper off.Dr. Frieden said the season appeared to resemble the “moderately severe” season of 2003-4, which also had an early start and was dominated by an H3N2 strain. In such seasons, 90 percent of all deaths occur among those over 65. Flu hospitalization rates are “quite high” now, Dr. Frieden said, and most of those hospitalized are elderly.Last year’s flu season was unusually mild. At the end of the season last year, 34 children had died.So far this season, the C.D.C.’s count of pediatric flu deaths, which includes premature infants and teenagers up to age 17 — has risen to 29, although this is acknowledged to be an undercount as it is only of lab-confirmed influenza cases reported to the agency.Henry L. Niman, a flu-watcher who follows state death registries and news reports, counts about 40 pediatric deaths so far and predicted that the total would ultimately be close to the 153 of the 2003-4 season, but much less than in the 2009-10 “swine flu” pandemic, when 282 children died. That flu was a strain never seen before and many more children caught it. The elderly had surprising resistance to getting it, presumably because similar flus that circulated 40 or more years ago had given them some immunity. But among those elderly people who did catch it, the death rates were high.Dr. Frieden suggested that the elderly avoid contact with sick children.“Having a grandparent baby-sit a sick child may not be a good idea,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/tennis/gussie-moran-tennis-star-dies-at-89.html,"Gussie Moran, who as a ranked American tennis player in 1949 caused an international stir and gained worldwide fame for competing at Wimbledon while wearing a short skirt and lace-trimmed underwear, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 89.She had recently been hospitalized with cancer, Jack Neworth, a tennis writer and friend, said.Moran’s daring outfit worn in a bastion of English propriety won her more renown than her tennis playing, though she was ranked as high as No. 4 in the United States, won the United States women’s indoor championship in 1949 and reached the quarterfinals that year at Wimbledon.By the end of her life she had come to know hardship — bouncing from job to job, living in near squalor, telling of abortions and rape. At her death she lived in a small apartment. But for a time, more than half a century ago, she was a household name around the world. A racehorse, an airplane and a sauce were named after her.Moran, who was 25 at the time, arrived in London for Wimbledon in June 1949 with a new outfit in mind, having already reached out to the British designer Teddy Tinling to create one.“I wrote him a letter prior to Wimbledon, asking him if he would design me something with one sleeve one color, the other sleeve another color and the shirt another color,” Moran told The Orlando Sentinel in 1988. “He wrote back, ‘Have you lost your mind?’ ”Tinling, a former tennis player and for many years the official Wimbledon host, told The Associated Press during the tournament that Moran had asked him to make her “look more feminine.”Sticking to Wimbledon’s all-white dress code, Tinling came up with a white silk sun-top jersey with a tight waist and bodice and a short skirt that boldly bared her knees. Underneath were matching white silk jersey panties trimmed with two inches of open lace.Moran displayed her outfit during a pretournament tea party at the Hurlingham Club, instantly inspiring a nickname. “Gorgeous Gussie’s Lace-Fringed Panties No. 1 Attraction on Wimbledon’s Courts,” a headline in The New York Times declared after the tea party preview.By the time of her opening match, photographers were jostling for position, many lying flat, the better to catch the most risqué angle as she served the ball. They were not disappointed.“The fringed panties are very much in evidence when Gussie races across the court or leaps for a high shot,” The A.P. reported.Moran, who was noted for a powerful forehand, won her match, defeating Bea Walter of Britain, but it was her underwear that became front-page news and a subject of debate in the British Parliament. The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club, the home of Wimbledon, accused Moran of “bringing vulgarity and sin into tennis.”Although Moran did not wear the lace panties for the rest of the tournament, the sensation they caused made her one of the biggest attractions in women’s tennis. She made a cameo appearance in the 1952 sports movie “Pat and Mike” with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn. The newspapers reported on her romantic life. And her underwear, soon christened “Gussie panties,” started a trend. Women began taking to the court in lace panties, T-shirts and plunging necklines.“Gussie was the Anna Kournikova of her time,” the former tennis champion Jack Kramer told The Los Angeles Times in 2002, referring to the Russian star and sometime model. “Gussie was a beautiful woman with a beautiful body. If Gussie had played in the era of television, no telling what would have happened. Because, besides everything else, Gussie could play.”But there were negative repercussions, too. Wimbledon banned short dresses from the tournament. By 1950 there were grumblings among the tennis elite that the attention Moran had received was unmerited, in light of her being ranked seventh among American women at the time. In 1951 the United States Lawn Tennis Association banned lace panties and low-neckline attire from its tournament in Forest Hills, Queens, that would become the United States Open.Tinling had to resign as official Wimbledon host and was not to be welcomed back until 1983, seven years before his death. In the meantime he had designed tennis wear for players like Chris Evert, Evonne Goolagong, Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade. Tennis wear evolved as well, rendering Moran’s outfit relatively tame by today’s standards.“Gussie wasn’t a revolutionary,” Tinling once told The Times. “She wore the dress for two reasons. She wanted to look good, and the shorter dresses allowed her to move more freely on the court.”Gertrude Agusta Moran was born on Sept. 8, 1923, in Santa Monica, Calif., and grew up in a grand Victorian house overlooking the Pacific Ocean. Her father, Harry, was a sound technician at Universal Studios, and her mother, Emma, was a housewife.Moran said she learned to play tennis when she was 11. While competing on a junior circuit, she and other young players were sometimes invited to play at Charlie Chaplin’s house on Sunday afternoons, trading volleys with stars like Greta Garbo and Olivia de Havilland.During World War II, after her older brother was declared missing in action, Moran joined the war effort, going to work at the nearby Douglas Aircraft Company.She was well into her 20s when she joined the amateur tennis circuit, in 1947, relatively late for a newcomer. But in nine months she won three major tournaments. Her victory in the National Indoor Tennis Tournament in March 1949 was on the wooden courts at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan, where she defeated Nancy Chaffee.Moran retired from amateur tennis in August 1950 and signed a one-year, $75,000 contract to play on a professional tour run by Bobby Riggs.Playing alongside Pauline Betz, Moran did not do well on the tour and left it after the year was up. She then began playing exhibition matches at military bases and hospitals as part of a tour managed by the tennis great Bill Tilden. She also joined a U.S.O. tour.Moran went on to work in radio as a sports director and in television hosting interview shows, all in Los Angeles. She was also a radio sportscaster in New York on WMGM, marketed her own line of tennis clothes, wrote for tennis magazines and taught tennis. In 1970 she joined a U.S.O. tour in Vietnam and sustained broken bones when a helicopter in which she was riding was shot down. She continued to compete in tournaments into her early 40s, Neworth said.She also publicly spoke of having abortions and of being found backstage beaten and raped during a Lawrence Welk concert at a Santa Monica centennial celebration. There was no arrest.Moran had three marriages, none lasting more than two years. She had no children. In her later years she went from job to job, often living in reduced circumstances after losing her home in the 1980s. At one point, largely supported by friends and fans, she was reported to be living with cats in a single room in a run-down building in Hollywood, the curtains made of bedsheets. In recent years she sold her tennis memorabilia and autographs online.At the height of her celebrity, Moran expressed frustration with all the attention she was receiving, some of it, in the gossip columns, exasperating. It was a Wimbledon title that she wanted more than anything else, she said.“Publicity follows me,” she wrote in an article for The A.P. at the time. “I cannot help it if people cook up phony quotes about engagements with tennis players I’ve never even seen off the court. I am interested in clothes I can play tennis in, not in creating a sensation and certainly not in anything anyone at all would consider in poor taste.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/arts/music/philadelphia-orchestra-with-nezet-seguin-at-carnegie-hall.html,"When the players of an excellent student orchestra want to pay special tribute to an inspiring conductor at the end of a concert, they stomp and shuffle their feet during ovations. On Thursday night at Carnegie Hall it was not a bunch of exuberant students but the veteran players of the great Philadelphia Orchestra who stomped their feet for Yannick Nézet-Séguin, the 37-year-old Canadian conductor now in his first season as the orchestra’s music director.And no wonder. The concert, following Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s acclaimed Carnegie debut with the orchestra in October, was phenomenal. The ensemble, famous for its glowing strings and homogeneous richness, has never sounded better.Mr. Nézet-Séguin chose works Ravel, Szymanowski and Shostakovich wrote between 1919 and 1937 that show them grappling with issues of modernism during tumultuous musical times. He began with Ravel’s dazzling “La Valse,” though he actually had to begin twice. Just as the lower strings, following Mr. Nézet-Séguin’s cue, were about to play the murky stirrings that open the piece, a cellphone emitted an unusual ring tone: it was the sound of a violin playing. Mr. Nézet-Séguin stopped the performance. After a pause and some laughter, he began again. But really, had he stormed off the stage, who could have blamed him?Ravel, who conceived of this piece as the “apotheosis of the Viennese waltz,” described the opening as “eddying clouds” that allow glimpses of waltzing couples until the clouds disperse. In this performance Mr. Nézet-Séguin drew out the music’s primordial qualities, as if the clouds were parting to reveal not waltzing couples but primitive dancers who had wandered in from “The Rite of Spring.” Ravel offers a radical deconstruction of the waltz, and sinister things keep happening in the background. The performance vividly captured both the score’s glittering splendor and its strangeness.In recent years the Polish composer Karol Szymanowski has been increasingly championed by major artists, including the brilliant Greek violinist Leonidas Kavakos, who was the soloist here in the Violin Concerto No. 2, written in 1933. Like other Szymanowski scores, this 20-minute work, played without break, draws from disparate musical currents: French Impressionism, Stravinskian modernism, the mysticism of Scriabin. There are traces of Polish folk music but also hints of Eastern exotica.Mr. Kavakos, playing with an entrancing combination of sweet sound and dark intensity, captured both the autumnal warmth and the restless energy of this deeply personal concerto.After intermission Mr. Nézet-Séguin turned to Shostakovich’s popular Fifth Symphony. This bold and ambiguous work almost screams “major statement.” A conductor had better have something to say about it. He did.In the first movement Shostakovich channels mournful feelings into a Neo-Classical structure. But Mr. Nézet-Séguin drew such intensity from the music that it seemed almost expressionistic. The scherzo came across like a heavy-booted and menacing dance. He tapped into the anguish of the funereal Largo, yet the Philadelphia strings brought grave beauty to its stretches of choralelike harmony.In the finale Mr. Nézet-Séguin coaxed vehement playing from the orchestra, with brutal, slashing power and pummeling rhythmic intensity. Was the final, triumphant (excessively triumphant?) episode Shostakovich’s ironic response to Soviet authorities who had condemned his music as decadent modernism? This performance was so driving and glorious you did not care.The ovation was enormous. The orchestra has come through rough times, including a financial crisis and a leadership vacuum. But the Philadelphia Orchestra seems to have found its ideal music director, though Mr. Nézet-Séguin will have to balance his commitment to Philadelphia with his international ambitions."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/arts/music/jose-jamess-no-beginning-no-end.html,"THE singer José James’s cool and confident new album, “No Beginning No End,” to be released by Blue Note next week, sounds like the result of the black-pop continuum, jazz and soul and hip-hop and R&B, slow-cooked for more than 50 years.It descends from a lot of things. First among them are the great neo-soul records of 2000, D’Angelo’s “Voodoo” and Erykah Badu’s “Mama’s Gun.” It’s got the lagging relationships to the beat on the hip-hop records produced in the ’90s and oughts by J Dilla; some of the ballad rumination in Stevie Wonder and Roberta Flack’s records from the early and mid-’70s; the tempos of Sade, the vocal color of Gil Scott-Heron, the phrasing of Billie Holiday.Its parts don’t have a clinically defined relationship, A + B + C. It’s an evolved compound, and the album sounds evolved in other ways too. It definitely wants to be appreciated by adult women, with songs like “It’s All Over Your Body” and “Come to My Door”: the male soul singer representing sex and trust and ethics, sometimes in duets with calm, female voices — the French-Moroccan Hindi Zahra on “Sword + and Gun,” the New Yorker Emily King on “Heaven on the Ground.” It’s likely to have a following among musicians, especially through tracks like “Vanguard,” with the rhythm section of the pianist Robert Glasper, the bassist Pino Palladino and the drummer Chris Dave, who play an intricate Morse code of funk and negative space. (Mr. Palladino, one of the bassists and producers on “No Beginning No End,” played on the D’Angelo and Badu records; the engineer Russell Elevado, who recorded this one, recorded those too.)Recorded in New York, Paris and London, the album is on a label famous for jazz, but this isn’t jazz: no solos. It’s got more live-band groove than most singer-songwriter music. It’s a little too warm and inward to be considered R&B. It is not trendy music, but its stubborn nonchalance gives it a kind of originality.“It doesn’t feel like he’s going for an older-singer kind of vibe,” Mr. Glasper said. “He is jazz. He doesn’t have to walk around proving it. And very naturally he’s a child of hip-hop and R&B. He’s just breathing.”I first saw Mr. James, 34, at the Thelonious Monk Jazz Competition eight years ago. He was small and compact and still relatively young, but his voice seemed bigger, deeper and older. He sang “Every Day I Have the Blues,” and he seemed to be referring to Joe Williams’s sleek version from the mid-’50s. It was a centered and anxiety-free performance. His bearing implied that he didn’t care whether you liked it or not. It killed the judges, including Jimmy Scott, who waved his hands in the air as if he were in church.Mr. James had come from Minneapolis, the only contestant in the competition who hadn’t gone to music school. The actor Billy Dee Williams, one of the M.C.’s, told him backstage that he ought to, which irritated him. “I didn’t have money to go to school,” he told me a couple of weeks ago over lunch in Fort Greene, his Brooklyn neighborhood. “It wasn’t a choice.” He didn’t win, but he did go to the New School the next year, staying on to work in the equipment room when he ran out of tuition money.Then things started to happen — a slowly unfolding series of events routing him through Europe, distant associations with hip-hop and house music, a false start on a once-great jazz label and his current rehabilitation on another one. He has been meticulous this time, financing the recording of “No Beginning No End,” and presenting it to Blue Note as a fait accompli. “Nothing was touched,” he said proudly.Mr. James grew up on the hip-hop and indie rock of the late ’80s and early ’90s: Ice Cube, Nirvana, the Pharcyde, Digable Planets. He is the son of a Panamanian jazz tenor saxophonist with the same name, though his father didn’t raise him; he lived with his Irish-American mother in Duluth, Minn.; Seattle; and Minneapolis. He joined his Catholic-school choir at 14 when his voice changed, then dropped out of school and worked at odd jobs for a while. “I had really fractured teen years,” he said. “It’s hard to piece it all together.”At 17 he moved back in with his mother and returned to school; his jobs gave him income to buy records. He did it methodically. First the basics, then a wide-angle understanding of the important labels, and then deep into single artists. (He spent $500 on Mosaic’s 18-CD boxed set of the Nat King Cole Trio on Capitol Records, he said, and listened to nothing else for a month.) Around this time he wrote words to John Coltrane’s solo on “Equinox,” to be sung in the vocalese tradition of Eddie Jefferson and Jon Hendricks. He shared his experiments with older musicians, the saxophonist Douglas Ewart and the pianist Carie Thomas, in Minneapolis, who had connections with Chicago’s avant-garde jazz scene of the 1960s; he started playing with them and forming ideas about the entire arc of jazz history.After graduating from high school he sought out a vocal teacher, who taught him opera technique but no repertory, just warm-ups and exercises. That was his only formal instruction, he said, besides records. Mr. James knows where his music comes from and speaks with specificity and certainty about what he’s learned. He calls Billie Holiday’s 1950s music on Verve, for example, “the blueprint for ‘Mama’s Gun’: where she sat in relation to the band, the way that the musicians supported her and the lines went through hers, Ben Webster and those guys playing counterpoint. She took her time. The whole behind-the-beat, J Dilla thing, she was all over that. She meant every word she sang. She took you to the pain right away.”And also: “She would reharmonize a line that sounded like it should have been written that way. And it’s clear that her genius came from her community: she really got tight with her musicians. You hear, in rehearsal tapes, ‘Try this, Billie,’ and she’d sing it like that, and remember it.”In 2006 he recorded a few tracks, including his vocal version of Coltrane’s “Equinox,” with a band. He went to London for another singing competition, which he also didn’t win, but handed out a lot of copies of his demo; one reached the BBC radio D.J. Gilles Peterson, who had become an important European taste maker, specifically where jazz meets electronic dance music. Mr. Peterson had started his own label, Brownswood, and they made two records together, “The Dreamer” and “Blackmagic.” The first, recorded in New York when Mr. James was still a student, sounds a lot closer to jazz, or his notion of it; the second was made more according to Mr. Peterson’s ears, downtempo dance music with jazz harmony. Among its producers were Flying Lotus, the Los Angeles post-hip-hop producer, and Moodymann, the Detroit house musician.Mr. James moved to London for a while, and he found an audience in Europe and Japan; he noted with satisfaction that instead of playing jazz clubs for 30 people he was playing spaces like the Paradiso in Amsterdam, a 1,000-capacity club where D’Angelo played last year. But Brownswood had no North American distribution, and it frustrated Mr. James that he had no career in his own country.“Basically I just feel like it was my image, you know?” he said. “Nobody knew what to do with me. It was either ‘You look like a rapper’ ”— he wears a Yankees cap over a stencil pattern cut into his short hair — “or, if I’m singing standards, ‘It’s not Michael Bublé, it’s not pop, it’s not easy enough to sell.’ ” He played an excellent set at the Charlie Parker Jazz Festival in Harlem a few years ago with Junior Mance, one of his New School teachers, singing blues and standards, but that wasn’t quite him. He played at the Blue Note with McCoy Tyner, singing songs from the album “John Coltrane and Johnny Hartman,” but that wasn’t quite him either. He briefly signed to Verve, the label that once released most of the Coltrane records he loved, but that resulted in “For All We Know,” a drowsy duet album of standards with the Dutch pianist Jef Neve; it won awards in France but didn’t sound convincing here.So he’s back, reinvented at Square 1. He has great young jazz musicians in his band, including the pianist Kris Bowers, but you won’t see him playing at jazz clubs, if he can help it. (He’ll perform at the Highline Ballroom next Wednesday.) Before long you may not see him in New York at all. “That sense of New York being the hub for artists is gone,” he said. “More and more, people are saying Berlin is cool, Paris is cool, Marrakesh is cool. My label’s here, my musicians are here. But I’m not going to stay here forever.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/arts/music/new-releases-petra-haden-ibrahim-maalouf-and-ra-ra-riot.html,"Petra HadenThe expansive interiority of a great film score — as properly experienced, in the flickering dark — might seem like strange territory for a vocalist working unaccompanied. But then Petra Haden happens to thrive best in strange territory. “Petra Goes to the Movies” (Anti-), due out on Tuesday, features her a cappella versions of more than a dozen movie themes, with her vocals meticulously multitracked. The arrangements are ingenious, emphasizing Ms. Haden’s gift for mimesis: she can suggest the swoon of a string section as handily as the blare of a solitary bugle. Her “Carlotta’s Galop,” from Fellini’s “8 ½,” has just the right jolt of Nino Rota circus mania; her “Psycho“ has all the spikiness and stealth grandeur of Bernard Hermann’s famous title theme. Ms. Haden takes a more conventional turn on several tracks with accompanists — the pianist Brad Mehldau, the guitarist Bill Frisell and her father, the bassist Charlie Haden — but she does her truest work here as a one-woman studio orchestra, her obsessive attentions clearing a fresh vantage on the music.Ibrahim MaaloufBorn in Beirut but raised in Paris, where he still lives, Ibrahim Maalouf has in some ways carried the mantle of his father, Nassim: both have made a specialty of playing Arabic music on the four-valve quarter-tone trumpet, with classical precision. But the younger Mr. Maalouf is more of a jazz musician, as he shows with “Wind” (Mi’ster), featuring the German pianist Frank Woeste and a few adaptable Americans: the saxophonist Mark Turner, the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Clarence Penn. The album’s melancholy gleam is no accident. It was commissioned as a complement to the 1927 silent movie “La Proie du Vent” (“The Prey in the Wind”) and inspired by Miles Davis’s shadowy music for another French film, Louis Malle’s “Ascenseur Pour l’Échafaud” (“Elevator to the Gallows”). The moods range from poignant calm (“Surprises”) to loping menace (“Suspicions“) to watchful languor (“Waiting”), and the band sounds alert and supple at every turn.Ra Ra RiotOn its face “Beta Love” (Barsuk) is the sound of a band finally plugging into the matrix. Ra Ra Riot’s previous two albums proposed a flowery, chamber-esque take on indie-rock, self-conscious sometimes to a fault. The new album, due out on Tuesday, plunges deep into synth pop, with Wes Miles’s tenor soaring sweetly over a range of mechanized textures. The band still has its violinist but not its cellist, and it got a vital assist from the producer Dennis Herring and the session drummer Josh Freese. Naturally there’s a concept, involving the cyberpunk sage William Gibson and the futurist-inventor Ray Kurzweil. Best to ignore all that. When Mr. Miles gets too literal, as on “Binary Mind,” you can begin to feel cornered. Far better is his bittersweet keen on “Angel, Please” and “For Once” and “Is It Too Much,” songs of direct melodic and emotional thrust.Jack DeJohnette’s Special EditionThe brilliant jazz drummer Jack DeJohnette has made something like three dozen albums as a leader; he’s a generous collaborator, which can make the issue of leadership a little nebulous. But his best work feels flush with anticipation, as if he were stepping to the plate for the first time. Special Edition, a changeable band most active in the 1980s, captured that feeling especially well on the four albums it released on ECM: “Special Edition,” “Tin Can Alley,” “Inflation Blues” and “Album Album.” Now packaged as a boxed set (“Special Edition,” four CDs, $30.99), these recordings exude toughness and exuberance, along with a limber equilibrium. Working with two or three saxophonists (including David Murray and Chico Freeman, at different times), and doubling himself on piano or melodica, Mr. DeJohnette combined avant-garde combustion with a cool lyrical instinct. “Inflation Blues,” an album previously unavailable on CD, features slashing work by the trumpeter Baikida Carroll — and an effective vocal performance by Mr. DeJohnette, on the plaintive, reggae-slanted title track.Colin Stetson & Mats GustafssonThe saxophonists Colin Stetson and Mats Gustafsson share a hard-nosed fascination with pure sound, along with a wariness of genre convention. Both have earned the loyalty of indie-rock obscurantists as well as avant-garde jazz partisans, partly by refusing to fit in. They hadn’t ever played together before the 2011 Vancouver Jazz Festival concert that yielded “Stones” (Rune Grammofon), with Mr. Stetson on bass and alto saxophones and Mr. Gustafsson on baritone and tenor. It’s a rangy, spontaneous dialogue, an eventful 35 minutes parsed into four tracks. At times, as in the tongue-slapping staccato portion of “Stones That Can Only Be,” they land on the same strategy in rough tandem. Elsewhere, as on “Stones That Only Have,” they root around like a couple of grumbling wildebeests. (The titles are a nod to the Swedish poet Gunnar Ekelof.) Whatever the effect, their rapport is capacious; this shouldn’t be the end of it."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/nyregion/a-movie-a-day-without-breaking-the-bank.html,"APP MoviePassPLATFORM iPhone, WebPRICE Varies by ZIP code but in New York City generally costs $30-plus per monthThe movie theater in my neighborhood is showing six of the Oscar nominees for Best Picture, and as of the beginning of January, I had seen only one, “Argo.” Catching up would be an expensive process, or a perfect opportunity to test MoviePass, a new service that works like an unlimited MetroCard for movie theaters.This is MoviePass’s third attempt at this idea. The first one never got off the ground because of a conflict with theaters, and the second required users to print vouchers at home, then take them in to redeem them — which the company acknowledged was too cumbersome.Last fall, MoviePass began offering its current service, which uses a smartphone app and a special debit card; after a trial, the company recently opened up its system to the public.The app is available only for iPhone use for now, although there is a mobile Web site that works for other platforms. An Android app is due out soon.Here’s how it works: Sign up and download the app, and MoviePass sends you a card in the mail. For families, each member would need a subscription and a card. You select the movie title, theater and time on the app. Once you’re at the theater, you check in with the app, and it confirms you’ve arrived (preventing you from buying tickets remotely for all your friends).Then MoviePass credits the price of a single ticket to the card, which can be used at the ticket counter or the automated kiosks. So long as there is a good connection in the theater, the process takes only slightly longer than buying a ticket the regular way.You can go to one movie a day. MoviePass says it works in almost every theater in New York. IMAX and 3-D movies are not included, but the company is planning to offer a service that will include them at a higher price.Whether it is worth it, of course, depends on how many times you go to the movies. The company has set its monthly prices to equal roughly three movies a month, so it costs just over $30 in New York City. Subscribers tend to go a lot when they first sign up, and then their activity decreases, Stacy Spikes, MoviePass’s founder, said.The company’s business model is not just a big bet that people will see fewer movies than they think they will. It is also offering movie studios the chance to place targeted advertisements within the app based on subscribers’ movie preferences. Mr. Spikes says he believes that theaters will want to work with the company, whose research shows that MoviePass members are more likely to buy expensive theater food because they do not have to lay out cash at the box office.The rub is that a MoviePass subscription requires a yearly commitment after a one-month grace period. Cancellation fees are $20 to $75, depending on how long you’ve been a member. I found it to be a wonderful service for this time of the year, when the temperature is in the 30s and I have to get ready for the Oscars. But before you sign up, it is worth thinking about what you will be doing every weekend in May."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/movies/sundance-lineup-shows-texas-films-transcend-slackerdom.html,"In the mid-2000s, the Malaysian-born filmmaker Yen Tan was living in Dallas and spent many long weekends commuting to Houston, where he was editing his first feature, “Happy Birthday.”He often found himself at rural gas stations and convenience stores between the two cities, wondering about the communities: Did gay men live in these small towns? If so, why would they choose to live in a kind of self-imposed exile?Mr. Tan soon went on online chat rooms and reached out to men who lived that way. What he learned made him think he might have the makings of a screenplay.“Most of these men are married,” said Mr. Tan, who moved to the United States in 1995 to attend Drake University in Iowa, and who is now based in Austin. “Most of them are closeted. A lot of them have kids. Some of their ex-wives live in the same town. I tried to think what kind of story might come out of this that I could actually personally relate to.”On Monday afternoon, the fruit of his research, “Pit Stop,” will have its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. The film follows the parallel stories of two working-class gay men, living in an unnamed Texas town: Gabe (Bill Heck), who still spends a fair amount of time with his ex-wife and their daughter, and Ernesto (Marcus DeAnda), who pines for a former lover who is in a coma.With its restrained handling of potentially soap-sudsy material, “Pit Stop” recalls the groundbreaking 2010 film “The Kids Are All Right.” It’s a movie that acknowledges the complicated nature of modern gay life and takes its characters’ homosexuality for granted. It also puts forth an unusual vision of small-town Texas — a relatively tolerant, but still self-conscious, atmosphere, where two men might be set up on a date by one of their ex-wives, but all parties involved whisper the details.“It was just a beautifully written piece that was perhaps not your typical LGBT film,” said Kim Yutani, a programmer for the Sundance Film Festival.“Pit Stop” is playing at Sundance as part of an unusually Texas-flavored program — one that reflects the increasing diversity of the filmmaking coming out of the state. If the Austin-to-Park City axis was once defined by chatty tales of rudderless 20-somethings, à la Richard Linklater’s “Slacker,” or scrappy, D.I.Y. action thrillers, à la Robert Rodriguez’s “El Mariachi,” the “Texas style” of indie filmmaking now seems more difficult to define.In addition to Mr. Tan’s gay romance, Sundance is also screening new works by Shane Carruth (“Upstream Color”) and David Lowery (“Ain’t Them Bodies Saints”), both Dallas-based; and Jeff Nichols (“Mud”) and Andrew Bujalski (“Computer Chess”), both Austin filmmakers. Serving perhaps as spiritual godfathers, Mr. Linklater and Mr. Rodriguez are also showing films at Sundance this year.Mr. Carruth, whose film “Primer” won the Sundance Grand Jury Prize in 2004, specializes in head-trippy science fiction. In their earlier films, Mr. Nichols and Mr. Lowery have tipped their aesthetic hats to the dreamy lyricism of another Texan, Terrence Malick. Mr. Bujalski’s earlier films of hipster angst, like “Funny Ha Ha” and “Mutual Appreciation,” owe an obvious debt to “Slacker,” but this new effort, set at a computer chess tournament in 1980, is described as a visual and thematic departure.“What’s interesting about this new generation is they all tell very different stories, in very different ways, and everyone seems to be influenced by someone different,” said Kelly Williams, a producer of both “Pit Stop” and “Black Metal,” a short film also being shown at Sundance. “Black Metal” is directed by another Austinite, Kat Candler, the highest-profile woman in this emerging group of filmmakers.Despite their disparate interests and styles, many of these artists know and regularly work with one another. (In addition to writing and directing his own film, Mr. Lowery was a co-writer of “Pit Stop” with Mr. Tan and a co-editor of “Upstream Color” with Mr. Carruth.) And most observers do not necessarily think these writers and directors are rejecting the influences of their indie ancestors.They are instead seen as proof that the utopia Mr. Linklater and Mr. Rodriguez first hinted could be — a vibrant Texas filmmaking industry that might serve as a viable alternative to filmmakers who did not want to live on either coast — has come to fruition.To illustrate the point, Richard Herskowitz, the artistic director of the Houston Cinema Arts Festival, mentions another film at Sundance this year: “Houston,” a corporate drama directed by Bastian Günther of Germany, who has moved to Austin since shooting the project. “It’s emblematic of what Austin and Texas have become,” Mr. Herskowitz said. “And that’s what makes for a really healthy film culture — one that’s open to the diverse international and cultural influences. A guy from Germany making a movie in Houston and now settling in Austin — I think it’s just fascinating.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/realestate/exclusive-an-upper-west-side-pop-art-playpen.html,"A whimsical glass penthouse on the Upper West Side with forever views, absolute privacy, and a rock ’n’ roll decorating theme — even the wallpaper in the downstairs powder room is a compendium of vintage Rolling Stone magazine covers — is about to enter the market for the first time since its original owner, Jeff Grady, bought and customized it in 2007. The asking price for the four-bedroom three-and-a-half-bath multipillared pop-art playpen in the sky is $12.5 million.The price includes outrageous embellishments, like a $500,000 Dale Chihuly chandelier that illuminates the floating glass-and-granite staircase like a firework in a state of perpetual explosion. The unit also has a custom privacy shade that can be pulled down to separate the kitchen from the living room: the sensitive visage stenciled across the width of the shade belongs to a young Bob Dylan. The silk-screened faces on the backs of the dining room chairs look familiar, too: they are copies of Warhol portraits. Every icon from Chairman Mao to Marilyn Monroe to John Wayne is represented.Should a buyer happen along and be enamored of both the 4,000-square-foot penthouse and its novelty décor, Mr. Grady will leave the furniture behind. “The artwork is not for sale,” he said of a collection heavy with Grateful Dead, Springsteen and Warhol; nor is the Gibson guitar autographed by Warren Haynes of the Allman Brothers and Gov’t Mule fame. But the pool table and the painted skateboard repurposed as a mantel above the gas fireplace can stay, too, if the buyer appreciates the fun of them.The unusual duplex, No. 37/38, is at the pinnacle of Ariel East, the glass tower at 2628 Broadway near 100th Street. Ariel East and its chunky sister tower, Ariel West, preside as the neighborhood’s only bona fide skyscrapers. Because their installation on an otherwise low-rise horizon provoked a hue-and-cry from preservationists and traditionalists, they will never be replicated; revamped zoning regulations prohibit future towers in the area. That belated stricture provides upper-floor Ariel residents with a perk and guarantee rarely available in New York City: the views they buy are protected, as is their privacy, despite floor-to-ceiling glass windows.Mr. Grady, a Web technocrat and self-avowed Deadhead who made his fortune with the invention of iPod and iPhone accessories, had used the penthouse, which offers 360-degree views of the cityscape that embrace the Hudson and East Rivers, Central Park, the Empire State Building and the George Washington Bridge, as a pied-à-terre for the last five years.“We stumbled on this apartment — this glass fishbowl — and it was like living on our own little cloud,” he said from his vacation home in Idaho. “Since the floors were just being put in when we saw it, we were able to make changes to the original floor plan. We took out some walls, opened things up even more: I obviously suffer from claustrophobia, not vertigo.”As a result of Mr. Grady’s tinkering, the duplex, for which he paid $6 million, now has the largest chef’s kitchen in the building, sliding glass walls in the game room/family room that hide a video arcade, and a flotilla of sophisticated audiovisual built-ins. The apartment contains so many closets that one is dedicated to bicycles. The elevator is keyed to open directly onto both floors.Mr. Grady, 44, said he had decided to test the market this year because he and his family have been spending the bulk of their time at a just-completed home in Charleston, S.C., “and also because my broker told me inventory of this type is low.” He had enjoyed a leisurely existence since selling his company, Digital Lifestyle Outfitters, to Royal Phillips Electronics in 2007. Begun as a one-man, self-financed innovation in 2001, the company was recording $100 million in annual sales by the time he decided to part with it. His next project will keep him close to home: he intends to build a music performance space in Charleston with “a House of Blues sort of vibe.”Amelia S. Gewirtz and Andrew M. Phillips of Halstead Property have the listing."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/movies/eytan-fox-director-of-yossi-about-a-gay-israeli.html,"WHEN moviegoers last saw the stoic young Israeli Army officer Yossi, he had lost a fellow soldier in a botched ambush along the mountainous, snow-covered border of Lebanon. Yossi stood by silently as a young woman told the mother of the dead soldier, named Jagger, that she had been his girlfriend, a fantasy that might have brought some comfort to the bereaved parents. But Yossi alone knew the truth: He had been Jagger’s lover.Ten years later this survivor from the director Eytan Fox’s groundbreaking 2002 Israeli film, “Yossi & Jagger,” is back in “Yossi,” opening in New York on Friday.During the decade since the first film came out, the treatment of gay and lesbian Israelis has undergone a liberalizing transformation, and the country’s cinema has experienced a creative renaissance. Mr. Fox has been a central figure in both cases.In much the way that “Will & Grace” and “Modern Family” have been credited with advancing the cultural acceptance of gay men and lesbians in the United States, Mr. Fox’s films anticipated societal change by being the first to portray gay Israeli men in everyday situations and free of stereotypes.But when we encounter Yossi again in Mr. Fox’s new film he has the dulled affect of someone suffering from depression, merely going through the motions of his life. Ten years after Jagger’s death Yossi is still in the closet.“I had left Yossi in such a difficult place, maybe even a tragic place, that I had this need to go back to him, to start a process of healing,” Mr. Fox said by telephone from his home in Tel Aviv. “It was a way for me to go back to not only where Yossi was 10 years ago but to go back to who I was 15 or 20 years ago.”At that time there had been one notable Israeli filmmaker devoting his work to the portrayal of gay men. From the 1970s to the early ’90s Amos Guttman made movies about gay men at odds with a hostile environment. (Mr. Guttman died of AIDS-related causes in 1993.)“When I was 17 years old, I drove to Tel Aviv to watch his first feature film,” Mr. Fox said of Mr. Guttman’s “Drifting.” “I was moved to see people going to see a movie with a gay character.” On the other hand, he was disturbed that the character was on the fringes of society, cruising for sex in public parks. “I thought, I don’t want to be gay if that’s what gay means.”That realization fueled Mr. Fox’s resolve to be a different kind of gay director. “I started my first short film with an Israeli flag because I fought in a war, I know the Israeli songs by heart,” he said. “I am not an Amos Guttman character. I don’t live in these underground bars. I’m gay, and I’m a part of Israel.”The author Nir Cohen, who devoted nearly a quarter of his recent book, “Soldiers, Rebels and Drifters: Gay Representation in Israeli Cinema” (Wayne State University Press), to Mr. Fox’s films, said: “He situated gay characters and gay issues at the heart of Israeli life. At the same time he’s one of the most popular filmmakers in Israel.”Mr. Cohen argues that Mr. Fox’s films paved the way for movies like “Eyes Wide Open,” a 2009 Israeli film about love between two Orthodox Jewish men. “That probably wouldn’t have been made without the influence of Eytan Fox.”According to Ohad Knoller, who played Yossi in both films, “Yossi & Jagger” changed the way Israeli films portray not just gay images but the military. “The army is supposed to be very serious,” he said. “But it’s real life. And if you want to tell a story of young people, young people are living in the army.”Mr. Fox followed “Yossi & Jagger” with “Walk on Water” in 2004 and two years later with “The Bubble,” about gay men falling in love across the Israeli-Palestinian divide. More recently he made “Mary Lou,” a musical mini-series for television that has been compared to “Glee.”Now 48, Mr. Fox found his creative voice when he studied film at Tel Aviv University, alongside Ari Folman, who went on to make the Oscar-nominated “Waltz With Bashir,” and Hagai Levi, who created “BeTipul,” on which the HBO series “In Treatment” was based.He also found his voice as a gay man. “While at Tel Aviv University I had a partner, and I felt strong enough to say to friends and family: This is the life I’ve chosen and I want you to love me for it.” (Gal Uchovsky, Mr. Fox’s partner of nearly 25 years, was a producer of “Yossi & Jagger” and is a leading cultural commentator.)When Mr. Fox came out to his father, Seymour Fox, then the director of education at Hebrew University in Jerusalem, his father was devastated. But the elder Mr. Fox entered therapy for the first time in his life. “He was in his 60s,” Eytan Fox said. “He changed. He became a better father to me and my brothers and a better husband to our mother.” (His father died in 2006.)In the new film Yossi meets a young, openly gay soldier. The journey that follows seems to mirror that taken by Mr. Fox and many gay men in Israel. Let’s just say the movie could have been titled, “How Yossi Got His Groove Back.”“Yossi was a victim of the Israel he grew up in,” said Mr. Fox. “He fears there’s a contradiction between being an Israeli man and being gay. That was the world I grew up in.”Intriguingly, “Yossi” reveals the title character’s surname to be Guttman, a seeming nod to Mr. Guttman the director and, in turn, the struggle for gay men to shed their self-hatred and emerge from the shadows of society. But Mr. Fox said the name is pure coincidence. “I didn’t think about it,” he said, then conceded, “Sometimes you don’t know everything you’re doing.”"

She appears in the popular BBC America period drama “The Hour.”READING I just finished a really interesting book called “Genesis,” by Bernard Beckett, which is a futuristic and very philosophical exploration of what is the human mind and why are we here. It suggests that ideas permeate through bodies and exert themselves to exist, and that the host is just a host. We think that we own ideas, whereas the truth of it is, ideas exist already and we are just a vehicle for them.Right now I’m reading “Valis,” by Philip K. Dick. It’s kind of the same book as “Genesis,” but a different context. It touches on how musicians, when they are writing a song, they may go into a kind of trance and the song is writing itself. And many novelists and painters have said similar things. I think it’s true for acting, as when you get off the stage and think, wow, I wasn’t even there. It just happened.WATCHING I’m a big fan of David Attenborough, who I think is the most adventurous of the nature program presenters. I’ve been working so much recently, which is fantastic, but I think my brain is a little bit saturated so I watch lovely, lovely animals and listen to David Attenborough’s wonderful and magnificent voice and just relax and look at how beautiful the world is.LISTENING I’ve been listening to Bobby Womack’s new album, “The Bravest Man in the Universe.” It’s really wonderfully composed and his voice is so soulful.I’m also loving Frank Ocean. I went to see him live at Coachella last year and completely fell in love with him on that stage. And I listen to anything with drums. I’m part Cuban, so anything with a good beat like Rumberos de Cuba gets me going.FOLLOWING I’m a big Twitter fan. I was cynical in the beginning but then the London riots happened two years ago and I was able to get home safe because I could see all the tweets from people telling what was happening.I’m a massive eater. So, I also follow chefs like Simon Rogan. And the singer Kate Nash, who is getting into acting. I just finished a film with her based on a play called “When Women Wee.” It’s a film based around the toilets of a club.PURCHASING When we finished that film, I got the director, M. J. Delaney, a teapot shaped like a toilet. It was made by this guy named Tony Carter who does novelty teapots. It’s wonderful.BOXING I love boxing. I box in a local boxing gym in London. I usually spar.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/arts/television/mather-zickel-reports-the-news-for-adult-swim.html,"WHENEVER “Childrens Hospital,” the kinetically goofy medical show spoof on Adult Swim, wants to push its satire even further into the meta-sphere, it brings in Louis La Fonda. He’s the inept fake newsman, played by the comic actor Mather Zickel, who “reports” on the show’s shenanigans for the parody-within-a-parody “20/20” knockoff, “Newsreaders.”Now “Newsreaders” is spinning off into its own 15-minute slot in the Adult Swim schedule. The show, which begins on Thursday with a report on a fleet of “sex vans,” stars Mr. Zickel, 42, as La Fonda and features a team of equally clueless correspondents investigating inane subjects and interviewing a rotating cast of familiar actors, comics and others. (Dan Rather makes a cameo in the premiere.) The veteran character actor Ray Wise is on hand as the resident curmudgeon raging against modernity, the effect reminiscent less of Andy Rooney than of a demented codger shouting on the subway.“ ‘Newsreaders’ always manages to blow the story one way or the other,” Mr. Zickel said. Though “Newsreaders” springs from “Childrens Hospital,” the La Fonda character actually originated in the 2007 indie comedy “The Ten,” directed by David Wain. Mr. Wain — who created “Newsreaders” along with Jonathan Stern and Rob Corddry, the actor and former “Daily Show” correspondent — is also an alumnus of “The State,” a sketch comedy troupe. Mr. Zickel, friendly with that crew’s members since their shared New York University days in the early 1990s, has appeared in plenty of “State” projects over the years (“Wanderlust,” “Reno 911!”).Mr. Zickel also starred as a suburban dad in “Man Up!,” a short-lived ABC sitcom last season. He spoke with Jeremy Egner from Los Angeles about shouting anchors and the Maya apocalypse. These are excerpts from the conversation.Q. News parody has been a popular form of TV comedy. How do you differentiate your show from all the others?A. We’re not breaking new ground in terms of the format. The difference is that these are all just completely absurd stories that no one would ever care about, and then the personal involvement of the correspondent makes it worse.Q. So they’re pointless to begin with, and then you don’t even get that right?A. Right, and they always feel like they’re breaking something really hot. [Laughs.]Q. So are you spoofing a specific kind of television news?A. If anything it’s the nighttime newsmagazine format. “60 Minutes” is the better version of that, but then you can look at “20/20” or any of these shows.Q. Any news show with a number in the title.A. Exactly. I’m basically trying to be the Mike Wallace of Adult Swim.Q. Is there a secret to nailing the faux news pomposity?A. Any local news tends to be spoken much more loudly than it should be! Everyone seems to be yelling at you, because it happened to be snowing! In Woodland Hills! Today! What about that? Everything takes on a lot more grandeur than it deserves.Q. Do you have a favorite TV reporter?A. I did turn on [the TV] not too long ago, and Barbara Walters is on talking about the existence of angels, and “could they be there?” It’s just the most specious kind of news. She might as well be talking about Nostradamus or something.Q. I’m sure there’s been a Nostradamus report at some point.A. I think it’s actually a story they keep digging up every 10 years. “Oh, it’s time to do Nostradamus again.” Or “The Maya Apocalypse is coming!”Q. Is it hard to squeeze everything you want into a 15-minute format?A. It’s good in a way because it strips the edit down to the best stuff. This is not a story-based show. It will live or die on the success of its jokes. We’re not following the lives of these characters. It’s all pretty glossy in that sense.Q. Much like the shows it’s parodying, I guess.A. Yeah. It’s just self-serving, arrogant people saying stupid things."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/arts/television/house-of-cards-arrives-as-a-netflix-series.html,"EARLY in the new Netflix series “House of Cards” the narrator and card player Representative Francis Underwood, played by Kevin Spacey, looks straight into the camera and tells viewers: “Power is a lot like real estate. It’s all about location, location, location. The closer you are to the source, the higher your property value.”Underwood is speaking at a presidential inauguration, just outside the Capitol in Washington. As viewers observe the swearing-in he asks in a delicious Southern drawl, “Centuries from now, when people watch this footage, who will they see smiling just at the edge of the frame?” Then Underwood comes into frame again. He’s just a few rows away from the president. He gives the camera a casual wave.Underwood, having been spurned in his bid to become secretary of state, is on a quest for power that’s just as suspenseful as anything on television. But his story will unspool not on TV but on Netflix, the streaming video service that is investing hundreds of millions of dollars in original programming. Its plan for showing “House of Cards,” an adaptation of a 1990 BBC mini-series set in Parliament, will itself be a departure from the usual broadcast approach. On Feb. 1 all 13 episodes will be available at once, an acknowledgment that many of its subscribers like to watch shows in marathon sessions.Another 13 episodes are already in production. Odds are, then, that viewers are going to spend quite a while inside Underwood’s head as he tricks, coerces and sometimes intimidates his opponents. “He makes you complicit in an odd way,” said David Fincher, the acclaimed filmmaker who directed the first episode of the new series.This is accomplished by having Mr. Spacey break the fourth wall, or address the audience directly. The original “House of Cards” did it too.“I loved the idea of being intimately part of the thought process of this lead character, because he could take you aside and explain to you what he was doing and why he was doing it and where it was headed,” Mr. Fincher said.He and the other producers won’t reveal exactly where their modern-day “Macbeth” ends up, though a shot at the presidency isn’t a bad guess. The characters introduced in the first two episodes include Representative Peter Russo, a pawn for Underwood, played by Corey Stoll (Hemingway in “Midnight in Paris”); Linda Vasquez, the president’s chief of staff, played by Sakina Jaffrey; and Underwood’s conniving wife, Claire, played by Robin Wright. “In politics there’s ambition, desire, lust, betrayal — all the same kinds of things we exhibit and experience in our own everyday lives,” said Beau Willimon, the show runner. Mr. Fincher, Mr. Willimon and many of the other players — all basically television novices — were brought together by Media Rights Capital, an independent studio that had optioned the rights to “House of Cards” thanks to an intern who recommended it to Mordecai Wiczyk, the studio’s co-founder.Mr. Fincher was finishing “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button” when he was introduced to the BBC mini-series by an agent. “David said, ‘I’d love to executive-produce this, and I’d like to bring Eric Roth with me,’ ” Mr. Wiczyk recalled. “Generally speaking, when you get that phone call, you just say yes. Which I did.”Mr. Roth had written the screenplay for “Benjamin Button.” Next, Mr. Fincher said, they had to “find a writer who would do the due diligence to transplant parliamentary politics to Washington.” Enter Mr. Willimon, who had written the play “Farragut North” and turned it into the film “The Ides of March.” After watching the BBC mini-series, he said, “I saw tons of great opportunities to make it our own, to make it contemporary, to broaden its scope and deepen its story.” It’s a “reinvention,” he added, not a mere remake.By the time Mr. Willimon completed the pilot in early 2011, Mr. Spacey’s agent had started asking about the project. (Artistic director of the Old Vic theater in London, “Kevin is an Anglophile,” Mr. Wiczyk said.) The actor was part of the package Media Rights Capital brought to HBO, Showtime, AMC and other possible television buyers.But before the studio met with any of them it put out a feeler to Netflix, thinking that fast-growing service might bid for the rights to repeat the show after a television premiere. The Netflix chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, a fan of the original, did what Netflix executives tend to do: He looked at the data. He found that Mr. Spacey and Mr. Fincher’s films were pretty popular among subscribers to Netflix’s streaming service. So were the films and TV shows in the category Netflix called “political thrillers.” And if that wasn’t enough evidence that a “House of Cards” reboot would fare well, there was this: The DVDs of the original mini-series were popular among subscribers to the company’s DVD-by-mail service.Mr. Sarandos also sized up the project qualitatively. “It looked incredibly promising,” he said, “kind of the perfect storm of material and talent.”He wanted exclusive rights to the show — a jaw-dropper at the time, since Netflix wasn’t in the exclusives business yet. His $100 million commitment to license 26 episodes, two seasons, sight unseen clinched the deal.Since the deal was struck in March 2011 Netflix has taken a couple of tentative steps into original programming, picking up overseas shows that had never been seen in the United States before. But “House of Cards” is the first show that can be called made for Netflix. It’s also the first to be considered, by those that do such considering, as prestigious as the programs on HBO and other top-tier cable channels. Netflix plans to have premieres of several other original shows this year, including a new season of the canceled Fox comedy “Arrested Development”; “Hemlock Grove,” a horror series produced by Eli Roth; a comedy, “Orange Is the New Black,” from the “Weeds” creator Jenji Kohan; and another called “Derek” from Ricky Gervais.For “House of Cards” what was almost as important as the two-season commitment was Netflix’s promise of zero interference. “We’re placing our faith in you,” Mr. Sarandos told Mr. Fincher and the other producers.Mr. Willimon said that he and his writing staff wrote drafts of all 13 episodes of the first season before filming commenced on a soundstage outside Baltimore last April — in contrast to most television shows that have a much more compressed timetable. What is compressed, in this case, is the release of the first season.“We approached this creatively as a 13-hour movie,” said Mr. Willimon, who eschewed cliffhangers at the ends of some episodes because, well, he could. “Knowing we had two full seasons in advance, I didn’t feel the pressure to sell the end of each episode with superficial cliffhangers or shock tactics in order to keep coming back, in order to jack up the ratings week to week,” he said. “I hope our version of a cliffhanger is compelling, sophisticated characters and complex storytelling.”Since the series is set in Washington, some viewers will surely wonder if the characters are stand-ins for a real political animals. “Yeah, people will be tempted to think that it’s a real-life portrayal of life in D.C.,” Mr. Sarandos said. “It’s not at all. It’s a piece of fiction that is incredible. It’s not an attempt to portray the nastiness of Washington. It’s an attempt to portray the nastiness of mankind.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/movies/san-diego-surf-maybe-a-warhol-film-at-moma.html,"ANDY WARHOL created movies by design, by chance, by mistake, and sometimes by doing nothing at all.“The nearest thing to a philosophical genius the history of art has produced,” as the art critic Arthur C. Danto called him, Warhol put quotation marks around the concept of motion pictures. One needn’t see “Empire,” a fixed-camera recording of eight hours in the life of the Empire State Building, to understand that he had created a temporal monument; by simply titling a similarly silent and static movie after a form of oral sex, Warhol transformed a half-hour close-up of a young man’s face in an apparent state of rapture to conflate the root meaning of “obscene” with “off screen.”In the mid-1960s Warhol upended conventional notions of motion pictures, making movies without regard to scripts or acting or editing or moving the camera. According to his erstwhile manager and assistant, Paul Morrissey, 74, interviewed by phone from his Manhattan apartment, Warhol “never directed anything.” Except, it would seem, from beyond the grave. Starting Wednesday the Museum of Modern Art is giving a six-day run to Warhol’s first posthumous feature, “San Diego Surf,” a movie that, considering its convoluted provenance and Warhol’s hands-off methodology, might be more creditably attributed to Mr. Morrissey.Filmed in May 1968, shortly before Warhol was shot and nearly killed by a deranged member of his entourage, and edited by Mr. Morrissey in the mid-1990s almost a decade after Warhol’s death, “San Diego Surf” did not receive a public screening until it was shown in late 2011 at Art Basel Miami Beach, under the auspices of the Andy Warhol Museum, which distributes Warhol’s movies. (It was also previewed last November at the Modern in conjunction with the series To Save and Project, on which I served as a guest curator.)Warhol’s earliest movies were silent, largely Minimalist exercises in extreme duration. In 1965 he purchased an unwieldy sound-on-film Auricon camera and began deploying the personalities he called “superstars” in fitfully dramatic situations, mainly devised by the playwright Ron Tavel. The frame was static, the shots were uninterrupted. Whatever happened in front of the camera over the course of a single setup and a 35-minute reel was the movie, and the results could be unlike any movies ever made. Because of a malfunction in the camera lens, the entire first reel of the Edie Sedgwick vehicle “Poor Little Rich Girl” is implacably out-of-focus.After the commercial breakthrough of the largely improvised, two-screen “Chelsea Girls” in 1966 Warhol shifted from Tavel’s desultory melodramas to cursorily edited ensemble films constructed around his garrulous crew of superstars. These more commercial features, including “I, a Man” and “Lonesome Cowboys,” were made in (uncredited) collaboration with Mr. Morrissey. After Warhol was shot and seemingly retired from filmmaking Mr. Morrissey continued making increasingly conventional movies under Warhol’s name — or rather, continued the Warhol brand into the 1970s with “Trash,” “Heat” and several 3-D features.“Lonesome Cowboys” ended with two of its principals taking off for California to become surfers; very much a sequel, “San Diego Surf” features much the same cast and was filmed, four months later, on a private beach in San Diego. As with “Lonesome” the movie was shot with two 16-millimeter cameras, one operated by Warhol and the other by Mr. Morrissey. The superstar Viva and the veteran underground movie performer Taylor Mead, paired in “Lonesome” as a man-hungry virgin and her epicene dueña, here play a wealthy married couple with a baby, looking to rent their beach house to some local surfers.As in “Lonesome” the puckish Mr. Mead cuts capers while Viva delivers a number of acerbic soliloquies, calling the surfers repressed homosexuals. Both profess sexual interest in the actual surfers who wander onto the set, intermittently serving as their stooges.In its lackadaisical way “San Diego Surf” anticipates the strategies of Sacha Baron Cohen’s “Borat” in its use of unwitting civilians as props. One such is an infant, identified at the movie’s preview screening by Mr. Mead as belonging to the couple who lent the filmmakers their house. In the course of a domestic spat Viva carelessly drops the baby. The child is caught by the surprisingly alert Joe Dallesandro, as Viva, only slightly abashed, continues her tirade.The real disaster would occur days after Warhol returned to New York. With the severely wounded artist recuperating in the hospital, Mr. Morrissey added a postscript (filmed in Warhol’s Union Square headquarters) in which Mr. Mead wheedlingly importunes an embarrassed-looking “surfer” (Tom Hompertz) to urinate on him as he absurdly crouches on a surfboard.“San Diego Surf” was at least partially edited, but although publicized, it was never released. One 1969 letter of inquiry received the response that the film was not yet completed and would be available later in the year. By that time Mr. Morrissey had opened his highly successful solo feature “Flesh,” and was preparing to shoot his second, “Trash.” “I didn’t think it was strong enough to hold an audience,” he recalled when asked why “San Diego Surf” was never released.A quarter century passed. In 1995, according to information provided by the Warhol Museum, the Warhol Foundation commissioned Mr. Morrissey, under the supervision of Dara Meyers-Kingsley, its film and video collection’s director at the time, to complete the editing in accordance with existing notes. Ms. Meyers-Kingsley, who left the foundation in 1996, said she no longer remembers the specifics of the project. Mr. Morrissey disputes them: “Where do they get that ‘partially edited’?” he said. “Where do they get that idea of ‘existing notes’? I never made any notes — and poor Andy couldn’t.”Mr. Morrissey recalls only checking the splices on the already edited work print and sending the camera original to the lab to be cut and printed. In any case it was there that the edited “San Diego Surf” continued to reside, along with as many as 25 reels of original material, much of it shot by Warhol, for another 16 years. Asked why it had taken so long to release Mr. Morrissey’s cut, Geralyn Huxley, the Warhol Museum’s curator of film and video, interviewed in a conference call with an assistant curator, Greg Pierce, said only that “we chose not to,” adding, “Our energy was working on other parts of the collection.”Despite Mr. Morrissey’s edit, the museum credits the movie solely to Warhol, and it will appear as Warhol’s in the catalogue raisonné currently being developed because, Mr. Pierce explained, “Anytime Warhol’s controlling the camera it’s a Warhol film.”But is it Warhol’s footage or Mr. Morrissey’s in the Morrisssey-edited version? Does it matter? In the mid-1990s the Andy Warhol Foundation set up an “authentication board” to determine whether certain silk-screens and other works were in fact bona fide Warhols — and, by implication, to devalue those that were not considered genuine. Attributing the Warhol Foundation’s restoration of “San Diego Surf” to Warhol reverses the process.Around the time that Mr. Morrissey completed “San Diego Surf” he came to an agreement with the Warhol Foundation, securing the rights to “Flesh,” “Trash,” and other Warhol productions and waiving them for movies like “Lonesome Cowboys” and others, including “San Diego Surf,” on which he might have a legitimate claim. Thus the 1971 feature “Women in Revolt,” a more interesting movie than “San Diego Surf” (and, according to my research, one in which Warhol was far more involved), is credited to, and owned, by Mr. Morrissey, while “San Diego Surf” is attributed to Warhol and owned by the Warhol Museum.“I cast it, I wrote it, I produced it,” Mr. Morrissey said, while cheerfully declining to take credit. “I did everything. Why don’t they attribute it to Lady Gaga? She’s much more famous than Andy.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/movies/escape-from-tomorrow-at-sundance-scrutinizes-disney.html,"PARK CITY, Utah — Is Randy Moore’s new movie about a father going insane at Walt Disney World simply cinematic art? Or is Mickey Mouse about to get very, very mad at Mr. Moore?A betting person would put some chips on anger after his movie’s premiere at the Sundance Film Festival here over the weekend.Mr. Moore, without permission from Disney, filmed “Escape From Tomorrow” inside its theme parks and hotels in Florida and California. If that wasn’t gutsy enough, his film is a horror fantasy that harshly critiques Disney’s style of mass entertainment. It’s not the Happiest Place on Earth in his movie. Not by a long shot.The movie, while careful to leave out certain copyrighted material (like the “It’s a Small World” song), would seem to test the limits of fair use in copyright law. It has a lot of Disney iconography: Mr. Moore, a first-time director and the movie’s screenwriter, filmed inside at least eight rides, and a lengthy sequence involves the line for a Buzz Lightyear attraction.How did Mr. Moore get away with it? After all, his cast and crew went on the It’s a Small World ride at least 12 times, filming all the way with high-tech (albeit small) video recorders. “I was surprised the ride operators weren’t a little more savvy,” he said.“Escape From Tomorrow” underscores the difficulties confronting Disney, intensely vigilant about its intellectual property, as it tries to control the imagery flowing from its parks as people are shooting increasing amounts of video with their smartphones. Disney has followed an increasingly patient approach, allowing video taken inside its rides, for instance, to be uploaded to YouTube. But that video is usually extremely positive.A spokeswoman for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts had no comment.The company undoubtedly knows it is in a sticky position. A strong reaction could only play into Mr. Moore’s hand, giving the movie free publicity and helping it find a larger audience. “How are you going to release this?” a reporter (not this one) asked after the premiere to John Sloss, a lawyer and longtime sales agent seeking a distributor for the movie. “Disney is one of the most litigious companies on earth.”Mr. Sloss responded, “Bring it on,” saying later he was joking.“Escape From Tomorrow” is about a family of four setting out to spend a day of fun at Walt Disney World. They ride the teacups and pose for pictures at Cinderella Castle, but Dad (Roy Abramsohn) starts to go bonkers after receiving a phone call from his boss. He drools over under-age girls, thinks animatronic figures are evil and coming to life, and pretends to shoot himself with a fake Frontierland rifle.There is a gruesome vomiting scene, a creepy obese guy on a motorized scooter and a sequence at Disney’s Epcot theme park in which Mr. Abramsohn’s character is Tasered. He is then taken to a secret room underneath Epcot’s Spaceship Earth sphere — referred to in the film as “the giant testicle” — and brainwashed. Ultimately he suffers a bloody death at Disney’s Contemporary Resort hotel.“You can’t be happy all the time,” one character says near the film’s end. “It’s just not possible.”Is Mr. Moore worried about Disney’s reaction? “Yes,” he said.This kind of tiny, arty Sundance movie used to have little chance of exposure beyond the festival, which attracts about 47,000 people. But the rise of video-on-demand services, on the Web and through cable and satellite providers, means that independent film audiences around the world are likely to have a chance to see “Escape From Tomorrow.” Social media and instant online reviews are already spreading the word.“A daring attempt to literally assail Disney World from the inside out,” IndieWire.com said in its review.Introducing “Escape From Tomorrow” before its premiere, Trevor Groth, the festival’s programming chief, called the film “wildly imaginative” and labeled Mr. Moore a “visionary.” Mr. Groth, in an interview later, compared Mr. Moore to the avant-garde director David Lynch.“ ‘Escape From Tomorrow’ perfectly embodies what we try to celebrate here, which is a truly distinctive singular vision,” Mr. Groth said.Mr. Moore made the film for less than $1 million with an inheritance from his grandparents. His cast and crew spent about 10 days filming at Walt Disney World in Orlando, Fla., and two weeks at Disneyland in Anaheim, Calif., he said. The credits mention over 200 people, although only small groups entered the Disney parks at any one time to avoid attracting attention.Still, there were moments during filming that Disney clearly knew something was up, Mr. Moore said. “I think they probably just thought we were crazy fans making a YouTube video, which is something that happens a fair amount,” he said. He added: “Look, I have amazing memories as a kid from going to the parks. I think Walt Disney was a genius. I just wish his vision hadn’t grown into something quite so corporate.”It may be cold comfort, but Disney’s is not the only theme park operation on which Sundance films are casting a harsh spotlight. “Blackfish,” a documentary by Gabriela Cowperthwaite, looks at the 2010 killing of a trainer by an orca at SeaWorld in Orlando. It had its premiere on Saturday and is billed by Sundance in a catalog as exposing “the species’s cruel treatment in captivity” and the “growing disillusionment of workers who were misled and endangered by the highly profitable sea-park industry.”Fred Jacobs, a SeaWorld spokesman, said in an e-mail: “Until we see the film for ourselves, we won’t be able to comment. I will say, however, that we set the highest standards for the care of our animals.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/hockey/rangers-hear-boos-in-losing-their-home-opener.html,"The Rangers’ long-awaited home opener Sunday night was nothing like what they or their fans envisioned. Sidney Crosby, Evgeni Malkin and the rest of the Pittsburgh Penguins skated circles around the Rangers, beating them soundly, 6-3. Most of the night, they looked even worse than they did in a loss at Boston on Saturday in the season opener.“We can’t let it snowball,” said Brad Richards, who assisted on two of the Rangers’ goals against the Penguins. “You don’t want to do that anyway in an 82-game season, but with only 46 games left, it’s got to be corrected quickly.”Rick Nash scored his first goal as a Ranger, a short-handed effort in which he cut beautifully across the goal mouth, wrong-footing Pittsburgh goalie Tomas Vokoun in the third period. But it came too late to make a difference, or to erase all the things that went wrong Sunday night.The Rangers were outplayed in every area, and their defense was shredded by the Penguins’ swift skating and clever diagonal passing. It got so bad that goalie Henrik Lundqvist was pulled as an act of mercy.By the second period, fans at Madison Square Garden who had arrived eagerly anticipating the first game in New York after the four-month lockout were raining boos down on the Rangers. Coach John Tortorella stood behind the bench, doing a slow burn.“I’m troubled by a lot of things,” Tortorella said. “As a group we just haven’t played well the last two games.”By the time the Penguins made it 4-1 with a power-play goal at 9 minutes 11 seconds of the second period — on a superb 150-foot passing combination, from James Neal to Chris Kunitz to Malkin to Pascal Dupuis for tap-in — the game was out of reach. Tortorella lifted Lundqvist for Martin Biron after Lundqvist stopped 14 of 18 shots.“I was not going to keep him in there with what was going on in front of him,” Tortorella said.It was the first time Lundqvist was pulled since Oct. 22, 2011, the Rangers’ sixth game of last season, a 2-0 loss at Edmonton. He left that game at 48:25 because of a problem with a skate.Biron stopped 19 of 20 shots in relief. The Penguins added an empty netter from Kris Letang in the final two minutes. Neal scored twice for the Penguins. Matt Niskanen and Tyler Kennedy also scored for Pittsburgh.In addition to Nash, Ryan Callahan scored for the Rangers, but while the Penguins were down two men. Taylor Pyatt also scored, his first goal as a Ranger.“He’s probably been our best player,” Tortorella said of Nash. “He’s the real thing — you can see that.”But Tortorella did not see much else that was positive.The Rangers were pushed around all over the ice. Even Crosby got into the act, flattening Rangers defenseman Stu Bickel with an open-ice check. Near the end of the game, Penguins defenseman Brooks Orpik shook up Chris Kreider with an open-ice check that Tortorella said was a clean hit.“That’s a big problem with our club right now,” Tortorella said. “Maybe we need to get whacked around a little bit more — it’d wake us up.”Arron Asham made his debut with the Rangers; Tortorella put him in the starting lineup to face his former team. Two seconds after the opening draw, Asham was fighting Tanner Glass, the Penguins’ new enforcer, in a prolonged exchange of blows — the 91st fight of Asham’s career.“I asked him when we lined up, he agreed, and away we went,” said Asham, who added that he did it in an effort to fire up his teammates.“Ash goes in there and hangs in there, and we don’t come in behind him,” Tortorella said. “When a player does something like that, as long as he did that, the other guys need to feed off that and do their thing. And that has not happened.”Callahan said the Rangers would have to make some changes quickly.“We got away a little bit from the way we were playing last year, the hard-nosed style, in your face,” Callahan said. “I think it starts with that, and it trickles from there into our systems.”The Rangers will try to fix their problems to avoid a third straight loss. Their next game is at the Garden on Wednesday against the Bruins.So early in a short season, the Rangers may already be entering dangerous territory."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/books/bhaskar-sunkara-editor-of-jacobin-magazine.html,"When Bhaskar Sunkara was growing up in Westchester County, he likes to say, he dreamed of being a professional basketball player.But the height gods, among others, didn’t smile in his favor. So in 2009, during a medical leave from his sophomore year at George Washington University, Mr. Sunkara turned to Plan B: creating a magazine dedicated to bringing jargon-free neo-Marxist thinking to the masses.If that hardly seems less of a long shot at fame, let alone fortune, he’s the first to agree.“I had no right to start a print publication when I was 21,” he said in an interview in a cafe near his apartment in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn. “Looking back, I see it as a moment of creative ignorance. You have to have enough intelligence to execute something like this but be stupid enough to think it could be successful.”The resulting magazine, Jacobin, whose ninth issue just landed, has certainly been an improbable hit, buoyed by the radical stirrings of the Occupy movement and a bitingly satirical but serious-minded style. Since its debut in September 2010 it has attracted nearly 2,000 print and digital subscribers, some 250,000 Web hits a month, regular name-checks from prominent bloggers, and book deals from two New York publishers.It has also earned Mr. Sunkara, now a ripe 23, extravagant praise from members of a (slightly) older guard who see his success as heartening sign that the socialist “brand” — to use a word he throws around with un-self-conscious ease — hasn’t been totally killed off by Tea Party invective.“Bhaskar’s a really remarkable — I want to say kid, but that sounds condescending,” said the MSNBC host Chris Hayes, who gave Jacobin a shout-out in Rolling Stone last June before inviting Mr. Sunkara onto his show. (Mr. Sunkara skipped part of his college graduation to appear.) “He’s got the combination of boastful assurance and competence of a very good young rapper.”And the praise doesn’t come only from the left-hand side of the spectrum. The National Review blogger Reihan Salam, who has linked to numerous Jacobin articles, called Mr. Sunkara “an almost hilariously savvy character who knows how to deploy mockery and flattery to great effect.”The magazine’s injection of a “vital left-of-left-of-center” viewpoint into the conversation, he added, “has been very fun to watch.”In writing Mr. Sunkara can come on like a one-man insult-comedy squad, whether the target is regular whipping boys like the Washington Post blogger Ezra Klein (“a young liberal with a lust for properly punctuated policy memos”) or the capitalist vampire squid itself.But in person he’s more straightforwardly earnest and quick to emphasize that the magazine he founded in his dorm room has evolved into a collective endeavor. Jacobin’s success, he said, springs from the highly cohesive politics of the four co-editors he has recruited and their shared commitment to advancing a critique of liberalism that is free of obscurantist academic theory or “cheap hooks.”Not that Mr. Sunkara, who is also the magazine’s publisher, dismisses the value of pop-culture come-ons (the new issue includes a radical analysis of the Onion’s online reality-television satire “Sex House”) or good visuals. The sleek design by Remeike Forbes, an M.F.A. student from the Rhode Island School of Design who e-mailed Mr. Sunkara out of the blue in 2011 offering to design a Jacobin T-shirt, has been essential to getting people to take the magazine seriously, he said.And when Seth Ackerman, a graduate student at Cornell University, turned in a scathing analysis of the Constitution’s inherent conservatism for the second issue, Mr. Sunkara knew it needed something to really pop.“Seth had a title with nine words and a semicolon,” he recalled. “I crossed it out and wrote ‘Burn the Constitution.’ ”That article, along with “Zombie Marx,” a critique of chapter-and-verse Marxist economics by Mike Beggs, a young lecturer in political economy at the University of Sydney who Mr. Sunkara met (like Mr. Ackerman) through the e-mail list of Doug Henwood’s Left Business Observer, got some pickup on blogs. But it was a packed Jacobin-organized panel on the Occupy movement, held in a downtown Manhattan bookstore three weeks after the protests began in Zuccotti Park in September 2011, that really put the magazine on the map, drawing attention from Politico and Glenn Beck.“The purpose was to force people to actually talk about ideology, about which ideas Occupy would stand for, about whether there should be any ideology at all,” Mr. Ackerman said, adding that many people he sees mentioning Jacobin on social media come from “Occupy-ish” circles.Meanwhile the magazine was also attracting attention from more established figures on the left, who saw it as raising fundamental questions that had been off the table since the collapse of the Soviet Union.Corey Robin, an associate professor of political science at Brooklyn College who became a contributing editor last winter, pointed in particular to articles by Mr. Ackerman and Peter Frase, another early Jacobin recruit, debating the possibility of a post-capitalist economy involving, among other things, drastically reduced working hours.“So many people are not working or already getting wages subsidized by the state — maybe there’s something already at play that we haven’t paid enough attention to,” Mr. Robin said.Mr. Sunkara, the son of middle-class South Asian immigrants who was voted “most likely to succeed” in high school, traces his politics less to experience than to reading. In seventh grade a stray reference in an introduction to “Animal Farm” sent him to Trotsky’s own writings. By his freshman year of college he was editing a blog for Democratic Socialists of America and writing for Dissent.His multitasking work ethic hardly shows signs of flagging. In addition to his position as a staff writer for the progressive monthly In These Times his 2013 projects include an essay collection for Metropolitan Books (edited with Sarah Leonard of Dissent), to appear in September; a series of Jacobin-branded books published by Verso; a $7,500 fund-raising drive; and, if he gets around to it, a podcast called “This American Strife” — ideally followed, he likes to say, by a lawsuit from Ira Glass.Mr. Sunkara also plans to keep writing for Vice magazine, where he has compared outrage over rich professional athletes to outrage over “overpaid” public-sector employees, all of whom he sees as just trying to negotiate their fair share.That time, Mr. Sunkara’s editor wrote the headline, the Vice-like “Jeremy Lin Is Not Greedy, You’re Just Stupid.” But when it comes to Jacobin’s goal of smuggling radical analysis out of the intellectual ghetto and into the mainstream Mr. Sunkara’s motto seems to be: by any means necessary.It helps, he said, “that liberals think we are relatively sane.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/arts/music/two-john-cale-programs-at-the-brooklyn-academy-of-music.html,"A drone, sustained and hypnotic, opened John Cale’s first program at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, “Life Along the Borderline: A Tribute to Nico,” on Wednesday. It enveloped Nico’s “Frozen Warnings,” sung by Mr. Cale and Meshell Ndegeocello, to start a concert of Nico’s songs featuring a dozen guest performers. Another drone — Mr. Cale’s sawing, insistent electric viola part in the Velvet Underground’s sadomasochistic “Venus in Furs” (written by Lou Reed) — ended his second program there on Friday (repeated Saturday), featuring Mr. Cale’s own songs backed by the Wordless Music Orchestra, including a full performance of his 1973 album, “Paris 1919.”The drone-to-drone symmetry was probably no coincidence. For the Academy series, billed as “When Past and Future Collide,” Mr. Cale, 70, was revisiting and reworking parts of a long and mutable career. His fascination with the drone — as a foundation, as a provocation, as something to get lost in — has been one recurring motif. There are others, conflicting and combining: stomping rock, meticulous chamber music, Celtic modes, improvisational noise, bleak cynicism, pervasive paranoia and glimpses of kindliness.In the 1960s Mr. Cale, who was born in Wales and came to New York, moved from avant-garde classical music, working with the pioneering Minimalist composers La Monte Young and Tony Conrad, into rock as a founder of the Velvet Underground, the fountainhead of uncompromising, primitivist, experimental art-rock. On his own since the 1970s, as both producer and solo act, he has moved at whim among elegance and brutality, mystery and bluntness. The two concerts could barely contain his multifariousness.The Nico tribute merged Mr. Cale’s imperatives with the songwriting catalog of Nico, the German model-turned-singer who delivered three songs on the Velvet Underground’s debut album and went on to a fitful solo career writing eerie, cryptic songs that she sang in a melancholy deadpan. On her albums “The Marble Index” (1969) and “Desertshore” (1970), Mr. Cale’s stark, windswept productions and arrangements were usually built around the undulating patterns Nico played on a harmonium; adding austere string arrangements or keyboards, they suspended the songs far away from rock or pop. Their 1985 collaboration, “Camera Obscura,” brought in more percussion, but was no less somber.The night before Mr. Cale’s Nico tribute, on Tuesday at the Cutting Room, Tammy Faye Starlite revived her cabaret revue “Chelsea Mädchen,” doing a careful Nico impersonation in song and speech, but she sang only one of Nico’s own compositions.Mr. Cale’s tribute went deeper and wider. He skipped the familiar — the Velvet Underground’s “Femme Fatale,” Jackson Browne’s “These Days” — and among the guest singers, only Sharon Van Etten approached Nico’s “Falconer” with the dark stoicism of Nico’s own versions.His other guests, and the new arrangements, extrapolated from Nico’s songs, bringing out the darkness and volatility that Nico held in. Peaches gave drum-machine momentum to “Mütterlein”; Kim Gordon and Bill Nace turned “It Was a Pleasure Then” into a two-guitar noise immersion. Ms. Ndegeocello and Joan as Police Woman summoned torch-song intensity in “Afraid” and “My Heart Is Empty”; and Alison Mosshart (from the Kills and the Dead Weather) stoked “Tanamore” and “Fearfully in Danger” into gothic incantations. Mercury Rev found a psychedelic haze in “Evening of Light”; Yeasayer brought an insistent synthesizer hook to “Janitor of Lunacy.” Mr. Cale’s ear was clearly reshaping the songs, keeping them on edge, far from nostalgia.“Paris 1919” is Mr. Cale’s most widely appreciated album and a career anomaly: a wistful, tuneful album full of chamber-pop orchestrations and even an unabashed “I love you” in the lyrics. Written while Mr. Cale lived in Los Angeles and worked in the artists-and-repertory department of Warner Brothers Records, “Paris 1919” is suffused with an expatriate’s distant longing; it’s filled with references to a bygone Europe.The Versailles Treaty ending World War I was signed in 1919, and lyrics in various songs refer to Andalusia, Spain; London; Berlin; Turkey; and beyond. Mr. Cale is by turns fond (“Andalucia”), sardonic (in “Graham Greene”), cryptic (“Hanky Panky Nohow”) and on the run (“Half Past France”). The album has one bluesy rocker — Mr. Cale’s commentary on “Macbeth” — but most of the songs have the composure of chamber-pop, with touches of parlor tunes and Vivaldi in Mr. Cale’s arrangements for strings and brass.At the Academy the Wordless Music Orchestra, conducted by Jeffrey Milarsky, played them robustly, largely recreating the album’s arrangements (although “Half Past France” grew more exotic, replacing the countryish guitar of the original with ragalike lines). Mr. Cale sang briskly and forthrightly, treating the old conundrums with avuncular affection, hinting at a lasting sympathy for the songs’ elusive characters and for a musical path he wouldn’t often follow.But he didn’t waste the availability of the orchestra for the second half of the concert. It included songs from his 2012 album, “Shifty Adventures in Nookie Wood”: “I Wanna Talk 2 U” and “December Rains,” which deployed the strings and horns like old soul tracks. There were also songs exploring Mr. Cale’s literary leanings — “Hedda Gabler” and his uplifting setting of Dylan Thomas’s “Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night” — and surprises like “Captain Hook” from 1979, a blend of chantey and passacaglia that churned like a turbulent sea crossing. But eventually the orchestra left, and Mr. Cale’s rock band took up the two-chord crunch of “Nookie Wood” and the dirge and drone of “Venus in Furs” — still bristling, still implacable."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/sports/basketball/iman-shumperts-pain-eased-his-hairstyle-now-turns-heads.html,"GREENBURGH, N.Y. — Iman Shumpert needed a project this past summer to help divert his focus from the painful and long road of recovery from knee surgery.One way he thought to help make the long months ahead more enjoyable was to change his hairstyle. Last season in his rookie campaign with the Knicks, Shumpert wore a low buzz cut. He quickly decided he did not want to return to having a long ponytail or braids, as he did when he was a teenager. So Shumpert’s older brother, Ahrii, who has been his barber since Iman was in eighth grade, asked what he thought about trying a haircut popular in the late 1980s and early ’90s.Shumpert eventually landed on the high-top fade. From the moment he was carried off the court with a torn left anterior cruciate ligament and lateral meniscus during the first round of the playoffs last April to his season debut Thursday in London, Shumpert has grown the hair on the top of his head but has kept the hair on the sides and lower back of his head trimmed.“At first, it was just to see how long I could grow my hair before I came back,” said Shumpert, who shares the look with Miami’s Norris Cole, perhaps the only current N.B.A. players wearing the high-top fade. Shumpert, who was born in 1990, added: “When I was growing up, all my cousins had high-top fades. I thought it would be cool to see how long I could grow a high-top.“Everyone in London loved it. For the most part, people like it. My mom said the ladies like it.”The hairstyle became popular in the black community in the late 1980s. The hip-hop group Kid ’n Play wore high-top fades in the “House Party” movies. The hairstyle had a presence in the N.B.A., too.The Web site Bleacherreport.com listed the top-10 high-top fades in league history, which featured players like Patrick Ewing, Robert Horry and Charles Smith. Of that list, Shumpert’s high-top fade most resembles the one Kenny Walker wore as a Knick.“It’s cool because you have hair, but you have a fade at the same time,” Shumpert said. “I could put designs in it, parts,” he said before pausing to add, “all that type of stuff. At the same time, you still have the pick-style Afro.”Most of Shumpert’s teammates have told him he should leave the high-top fade in the past.“It’s awful,” J. R. Smith said. “It was cool for a while, but he’s taking it too far now. He got to cut it.”Shumpert, who at 22 is the Knicks’ youngest player, said Carmelo Anthony and Kurt Thomas joked daily about his hair. “They just want high tops,” he said. “They want it, but they’re too old.”Shumpert said he planned to keep his high-top fade. When Shumpert’s mixtape album, Th3 #Post90s, was released in December, his high-top fade was the focal point of the album cover. He loves the haircut so much he has a tattoo on his left forearm of Johnny Bravo, a cartoon character with pompadour-style hair.Coach Mike Woodson, who is bald but has spent years working on his famous goatee, laughed when asked about Shumpert’s hair.“Everybody has their choice,” Woodson said. “He’s a good-looking dude. If that’s what he wants to wear, so be it. As long as he plays well is all I care about. I just think he wants to be taller.”When the Knicks play the Brooklyn Nets on Monday, it will be Shumpert’s first game back at Madison Square Garden. Last season, fans gravitated to Shumpert because of his personality, his tough perimeter defense and his high leaping ability. Now, they can also talk about his hairstyle.Shumpert said he also takes pleasure in knowing his hairstyle helped him in a small way get through his rehabilitation.“I had a lot of fun with it,” he said. “But I’m having even more fun now that I’m out there playing basketball again.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/arts/dance/police-say-sulfuric-acid-was-used-in-attack-on-sergei-filin.html,"MOSCOW — The police have analyzed the liquid used in an attack last week on Sergei Filin, the artistic director of the Bolshoi Ballet, and determined that it was probably sulfuric acid, a police official told the Interfax news agency on Sunday. Sulfuric acid burns the cornea on contact and can cause permanent blindness.Mr. Filin sustained third-degree burns on his face and eyes after a masked assailant approached him outside his apartment building Thursday night and flung the caustic liquid in his face. Mr. Filin, a dancer who rose through the ranks to lead the world’s largest ballet company, had been receiving threats for weeks, and Bolshoi officials said they were convinced that he was targeted because of his work.Mr. Filin suggested as much in a short interview in his hospital room with a reporter from Ren-TV. “Someone’s not pleased that I am leading the Bolshoi Theater well and successfully,” he said.Mr. Filin underwent an operation on his eyes on Friday, and a second operation is scheduled for Tuesday or Wednesday, according to Aleksandr Mitichkin, chief doctor at the Moscow clinic where he is being treated, according to Interfax. Mr. Mitichkin said Mr. Filin was improving and able to sleep without painkillers. Though his recovery may last for months, Bolshoi officials said on Friday that there was no chance Mr. Filin, 42, would be fully blinded.Investigators questioned Mr. Filin on Saturday, and the police have said they are investigating a variety of theories, including professional grudges or disputes over money. His associates and relatives have speculated that Mr. Filin had threatened commercial interests associated with the theater, or that one of his rivals hoped to take his job. Yuri Burlak, one of his predecessors in the position, told the newspaper Izvestiya that he favored the second theory, noting that Mr. Filin had three years left on his contract.Nikolai Tsiskaridze, a popular principal dancer who has clashed publicly with Mr. Filin, condemned the crime on Russia’s Channel One news on Sunday, saying it went leagues beyond the artistic rivalries that are woven into the theater’s history.“There have always been stories about glass in point shoes, about cats thrown onto the stage, about brooms thrown onto the stage and so on,” he said. “This is a peculiar part of theatrical life, and no one has changed it,” he said. “That is just hooliganism compared to what happened to Sergei, because throwing acid in someone’s face — that is a monstrous crime, which does not just disfigure a person’s life, but strips him of livelihood, of his eyesight itself. This is monstrous.”Mr. Filin has made clear his intent to stay on as the ballet company’s artistic director, focusing on his creative plans during a Saturday conversation with Russia’s minister of culture, and the theater’s director said there were no plans to replace him.Discussion of the crime has showed no sign of slowing, and one Bolshoi veteran wrote on Facebook that professional ethics in the theater had deteriorated in recent years. Mr. Burlak dismissed that idea in his interview with Izvestiya.“I would never in my life say that our theater is some big, boorish crossroads,” he said. “Our country as a whole, and relations between people, have changed for the worse, unfortunately. I would not make this out to be the misfortune just of the Bolshoi Theater. The theater is an expression of Russian life. It’s our country in miniature.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/nyregion/move-stay-or-wait-and-see-on-kissam-avenue.html,"It was a strange sight: A woman standing in the doorway of her home on Kissam Avenue on Staten Island on a recent Saturday morning wearing pajamas and slippers.“I just got up,” a sleepy-eyed Franca Costa said apologetically.Not too long ago here, the appearance of someone at her door dressed in sleepwear, especially on a weekend morning, would not have warranted a second thought. But Hurricane Sandy upended normalcy on this street, one of the hardest hit in the city, making the ordinary extraordinary.The storm pummeled all of the houses on the avenue, on the island’s eastern shore, flattening nearly half of them, inflicting extensive water damage on the others and forcing all the residents to seek temporary housing.Since then, the street by day has buzzed with contractors and building inspectors, insurance adjusters and utility workers, reporters and disaster tourists. By night it has gone dark and quiet, an occasional police cruiser breaking the stillness.But two weeks ago, Ms. Costa became the first resident of Kissam Avenue to move back home.“Come on in,” she chirped. Her two-story bungalow at No. 14 was toasty warm; a new boiler pumped heat through new ducts. There were new walls, a new wooden floor, a new electrical system, new kitchen appliances, a new bathroom and new furniture, much of it donated by friends and strangers. Shelves were lined with religious icons and recovered photos in frames.Three dogs luxuriated on the duvet atop her bed, their barking sounding less menacing than celebratory.While Ms. Costa’s homecoming suggested a return to some sort of normalcy, the future of the block remained highly uncertain.Among the property owners whose homes are still standing, some have been doing repairs and are preparing to move back in. Others, however, have been stuck in an uncomfortable holding pattern, delayed by slow-moving insurance companies and ephemeral contractors, or awaiting the possibility of new flood maps and building and zoning guidelines that might determine how — or even whether — they should rebuild.Although the circumstances are different from property to property, there appears to be a shared hope among Kissam Avenue’s residents that the authorities will buy their land as part of a watershed restoration project. The property owners have been meeting with residents of other nearby streets to form a united front and lobby the city and state for a buyout.But that process could take a long time, residents say, and many who are pressing ahead with repairs are driven as much by financial imperatives as by emotional necessity because they are having trouble paying both a mortgage on their homes and rent for temporary lodgings.Marisa and Claudio Finco, at 69 Kissam Avenue, have been renting an apartment in Brooklyn and are working on their home every weekend. A week ago, they were repairing holes in the siding of the house where the storm surge had turned tree trunks and other debris into battering rams. They said their efforts to rebuild have been stymied by a mercurial contracting firm that was supposed to install a new boiler, which will allow them to dry out the interior of their house once and for all and begin replacing all the drywall and flooring.“They came two to three times, they did inspections and then they disappeared,” Mr. Finco said. “No call, no nothing.”That afternoon, Jane and Vinny Caravello dropped by the Fincos’ to say hello. The Caravellos lived at 115 Kissam Avenue until the storm pulverized their house. All that remains of it is the staircase, which sprouts from the rubble like a totem from an ancient settlement.Their mortgage bank recently sent them a check for $50,000 to help rebuild, said Mr. Caravello, who drives a truck for the United States Postal Service. “I sent it back!” he exclaimed. “We have no information on building codes!”“You know,” he added, turning to his wife, “we should’ve sold when that guy offered us.”Several years ago, he explained, a stranger driving down the avenue slowed in front of the couple’s house, leaned out his window and shouted, “Four hundred and fifty!” A purchase offer.But the Caravellos were not interested. They loved the place too much, a common sentiment among Kissam Avenue’s residents, who all said it was a hidden bastion of neighborliness and quietude. Residents picked one another’s children up from school; they knew where their neighbors’ house keys were hidden in case there was an emergency. In the neighborhood, surrounded by wetlands, water fowl and deer were a common sight. They called it “the poor man’s Hamptons.”But residents speak of all of that as a thing of the past. The Caravellos are now thinking about relocating permanently to New Jersey.“I don’t want to leave here,” Mr. Caravello said, then shrugged in resignation and headed for his car. “What are you going to do?”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/arts/music/d-j-spookys-nauru-elegies-at-metropolitan-museum.html,"The motto of Met Museum Presents, the Metropolitan’s revamped series of concerts and lectures, is “It’s All About the Met.”It is a succinct summary of the programming priority of Limor Tomer, the series’s general manager: tying the presentations to the museum’s collections and exhibitions. To that end Ms. Tomer invited Paul D. Miller, the composer and hip-hop turntablist who performs as D J Spooky, to be an artist in residence this season, creating a series of events connected to the art on display.Friday evening brought Mr. Miller’s second offering, “The Nauru Elegies,” a well meaning but embarrassing spectacle ostensibly related to the collection of Oceanic art. (Mr. Miller led a tour of those galleries on Saturday.)Even before connecting with the Met, Mr. Miller nursed an interest in the tiny South Pacific island of Nauru, a onetime German colony occupied by the Japanese during World War II, exploited for its mineral resources and abused as a tax shelter. Its sad history inspired “The Nauru Elegies,” which, according to Mr. Miller’s Web site, “represents a virtual territory at a culmination of global currents, and creates music compositions that reflect that kind of virtuality.”Many such pseudo-academic buzzwords are thrown around during the hourlong work. Its technological and philosophical ambitions are lofty.But as multimedia performances go “The Nauru Elegies” is essentially standard issue. Mr. Miller’s electronic rhythms, textures and samples join syrupy melodies and pulsing arpeggios for a live string quartet (the intrepid teenagers of the Pannonia Quartet, part of the new-music youth ensemble Face the Music) as the accompaniment to shaky video footage of the island, focusing on the melancholy ruins of the Nauru Phosphate Corporation.The video footage is punctuated by interminable computer simulations of urban and island topographies and quotations from writers ranging from Goethe to Adorno about art, economics and, thanks to the postcolonial theorist Gayatri Spivak, the “abyss of deconstruction.” High-minded, confusing and boring, the whole thing is an overearnest assemblage simultaneously bloated and thin.The music is simplistic; the beats are bland; the emotional landscape is vaguely, well, elegiac. Its numbing style is shared by artists like the composer Mason Bates and the violinist Daniel Bernard Roumain. They, like Mr. Miller, specialize in acoustic-electronic combinations and receive an outsize amount of attention and prestigious commissions because of their presumed — and in my experience, unproven — ability to draw young, diverse audiences to traditionally staid musical settings like the Met.As for the Met, I am all for bringing the topic of global economic instability into the museum, many of whose donors are important participants in the financial system implicated by Mr. Miller. But his critique of that system is so weak and his artistry so ponderous that “The Nauru Elegies” must be counted, at best, a missed opportunity."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/movies/michael-winner-death-wish-director-dies-at-77.html,"Michael Winner, the brash British director known for violent action movies starring Charles Bronson including “The Mechanic” and the first three “Death Wish” films, died on Monday at his home in London. He was 77.His wife, Geraldine, confirmed his death in a statement to British news media. Mr. Winner revealed last summer that he had heart and liver ailments.Mr. Winner’s films viscerally pleased crowds, largely ignored artistic pretensions and often underwhelmed critics. He directed many major stars in more than 30 films over more than four decades.Marlon Brando played Quint in “The Nightcomers” (1971), a prequel to Henry James’s “The Turn of the Screw” (Vincent Canby called it “quite bad” in The New York Times); Sophia Loren played a wife who traveled to the tropics to avenge her husband’s murder in the action film “Firepower” (1979) (“A lot happens,” Janet Maslin wrote in The Times, “None of it makes sense.”); and Oliver Reed played an adman who tried to escape the crass commercialism represented by his boss, Orson Welles, in the comedy-drama “I’ll Never Forget What’s’isname” (1967).Mr. Winner’s most recognizable work remains a series of high-body-count action melodramas starring Charles Bronson. In “The Mechanic” (1972) Mr. Bronson played a bloodthirsty assassin, and in “The Stone Killer” (1973) he played a bloodthirsty police detective. But the actor-director team perfected their formula with “Death Wish” (1974).Mr. Bronson played Paul Kersey, a New York City architect who becomes a vigilante after his wife is murdered and his daughter is sexually assaulted by muggers. The film struck a chord with audiences who were titillated by its extreme violence and what many took as its tough anti-crime stance, but some critics were appalled at what they saw as a transparent attempt to manipulate audiences and the cheapening of suffering and death.“It’s a tackily made melodrama, but it so cannily orchestrates the audience’s responses that it can appeal to law-and-order fanatics, sadists, muggers, club women, fathers, older sisters, masochists, policemen, politicians, and, it seems, a number of film critics,” Vincent Canby wrote in The Times. “Its message, simply put, is: KILL. TRY IT. YOU’LL LIKE IT.”Mr. Winner directed two more successful films in the series, but dropped out of the final two.Michael Robert Winner was born in London on Oct. 30, 1935. The son of a well-to-do business owner, Mr. Winner graduated from Cambridge, having studied law and economics.He was always fascinated by film, and resolved to become a director after college, even though his family thought the industry vulgar.Mr. Winner initially struggled to find work. “Eventually I conned my way into doing a few shorts, documentaries, commercial spots and things,” he said in The London Sunday Times in 1970.The odd jobs led to his first feature, the pop musical “Play It Cool” (1962). By the 1970s his work had reached American audiences.He was confident on set, sometimes bordering on the dictatorial. “You have to be an egomaniac about it. You have to impose your own taste,” he said. “The team effort is a lot of people doing what I say.”Mr. Winner also made movies with Anthony Hopkins and Burt Lancaster. His last film was the comic thriller “Parting Shots” (1998), about a photographer who decides to kill everyone who has wronged him in life after a doctor mistakenly tells him he has six weeks to live.For almost 20 years, Mr. Winner wrote a weekly food column titled “Winner’s Dinners” for The Sunday Times of London.Survivors include his wife, the former Geraldine Lynton-Edwards, whom he dated off and on for more than 50 years before they married in 2011.When Mr. Winner proposed, he did not drop to one knee. “If I had,” he told The Daily Mail, “I doubt I would have been able to get back up.”"

Last year’s question — “What is your favorite deep, elegant or beautiful explanation?” — drew responses from more than 150 scientists and creative thinkers. The geographer Jared Diamond wonders at the 1950s experiments that revealed how plants and animals generate electricity; the anthropologist Helen Fisher thinks we can transcend the old nature-nurture debates by studying how the environment can turn genes on and off.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/business/media/at-sundance-early-sales-are-mixed-with-caution.html,"PARK CITY, Utah — After the premiere of a documentary called “Twenty Feet From Stardom” at the Sundance Film Festival here on Thursday, the movie’s director, Morgan Neville, shared a blunt anecdote with the crowd.At the outset of the production, he said, one of the financial backers, Gil Friesen, told him, “I don’t want to lose money.” Mr. Neville’s quick response: “You might have better odds at the track.”That harsh reality endures, despite shifts in the nature of distribution that have made the independent film business healthier than it has been in years. Those changes include meaningful new revenue from video-on-demand services, stabilizing DVD sales and a cluster of upstart distribution companies.There have already been a flurry of distributor purchases at this year’s festival. HBO acquired the documentary “Pussy Riot — A Punk Prayer,” about the Russian radical-feminist rock band, for an undisclosed price. Relativity Media spent about $4 million for “Don Jon’s Addiction,” a comedy about a man who watches a little too much Internet pornography, and committed to a wide release.But the vast majority of the 119 feature films in this year’s Sundance lineup — even if they do find a distributor — will still not recoup their production costs, much less turn a profit, producers and agents say. On-demand sales in particular are helping, but they do not yet not represent the broad windfall that many financiers and filmmakers are counting on, said Tom Bernard, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, a regular Sundance buyer.With video on demand, Mr. Bernard said, “There is myth information about where the pot of gold is.”Last year, at least 28 movies were bought here by distributors, more than double the number of the 2008 festival — prompting some chest beating by Sundance, which strives to bring independent film to broader audiences.“Beasts of the Southern Wild,” bought here last year by Fox Searchlight Pictures for about $1 million, has taken in $11.3 million at the box office and collected four Oscar nominations. The Richard Gere drama “Arbitrage,” bought by Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions for about $2.5 million, generated $8 million in ticket sales.“Arbitrage” was also a huge success on video on demand, where it took in about $14 million, according to Lionsgate.But those films — held up as examples of what is possible here — were by far the exception and not the rule. More typical was the comedy “For a Good Time, Call ... .” The film cost Focus Features, the specialty unit of Universal Pictures, about $2.5 million to buy, but it fizzled outside of the festival’s clubby confines and took in just $1.3 million at the box office. Of the 28 films bought from last year’s festival, 12 sold $700,000 or less in tickets (with several selling less than $70,000); four still have not been released.And while distributors are chattering about how wonderful video on demand is, most of the agents responsible for selling these films say privately that it is still viewed as a last option, “the deal you take when you can’t do any better,” in the words of one agent, who asked for anonymity so he could speak candidly.Though making money from independent films may remain a crap shoot, some aspects of the new Sundance sales game have solidified into rules.Gone are the days, most everyone here agrees, of dizzying prices, as when “Little Miss Sunshine” sold for $10.5 million in 2006 ($12 million in today’s dollars). The time of frantic bidding wars among the specialty divisions of major studios — some of which, like Miramax, no longer exist — has also passed.Now, $6 million is considered a big acquisition price. The pace of making deals has also become steady and deliberate, as sellers weigh their expanding options and buyers think more carefully about whether films truly have crossover appeal.“It has become much more adult and more sophisticated,” said Graham Taylor, the William Morris Endeavor agent who sold both “Arbitrage” and “Beasts of the Southern Wild” and this year is representing pictures like the drama “Fruitvale.”(The Weinstein Company bought “Fruitvale” on Monday for about $2 million.)“It takes time to really hammer through deal components that are new, like, ‘What’s the social media plan for this movie?’ ” Mr. Taylor added. That means deals can now close long after Sundance ends.Deal conversations have also become less about upfront payment and more about securing marketing commitments and back-end “waterfall” arrangements — the sharing of ancillary revenue like online streaming and television rights — said Rena Ronson, an agent at United Talent Agency, which has 12 films for sale here.Agents also point out that Sundance, which began on Thursday and will conclude on Sunday, has returned in recent years to its roots as a champion of experimental and arty filmmaking.As a result, the more commercial Toronto International Film Festival has in some ways surpassed Sundance as a barometer for the health of the independent film business, they say.That does not mean Sundance is irrelevant, however. The shopping here for documentaries in recent days has been extremely strong, for instance.HBO has long dominated the documentary field, but Showtime picked up “The History of the Eagles” over the weekend, and CNN Films, another new player, is considering multiple films. Sundance Selects, bought “Dirty Wars,” billed as “the truth behind America’s covert wars.”As for Mr. Neville’s documentary, “Twenty Feet From Stardom,” which celebrates the lives of backup singers, it was snapped up by Radius-TWC, a unit of the Weinstein Company. It paid about $1 million for North American rights, a healthy price for a documentary. (Elle Driver/Wild Bunch bought overseas rights.)As a result, Mr. Neville is well on his way to meeting his producer’s demand for profitability, though it will be bittersweet since Mr. Friesen, a well-known music mogul, died in December.“I feel like I’m having my Cinderella moment at 45,” Mr. Neville said in a telephone interview. “But I sure didn’t bank on it.”"

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. “It’s not a novelty this time,” said Holly Wieland, 57, of Reston, Va., who attended President Obama’s first inauguration. “It’s like the first time you say, ‘Maybe it’s an aberration.’ But it’s for real now.”Marquita Payne, 30, came from Lynchburg, Va., with her 9-year-old daughter, who took photos a few yards away. Ms. Payne talked about why she and her daughter braved the 30-degree temperatures to see the memorial before sunrise. “He’s big,” she said, admiring the statue. “He stands for everything that’s going on now.”8:45 a.m.Gone Fishin’Aboard the Coast Guard cutter Chock on the Potomac River, a call crackled over the radio: A small craft had been spotted in a restricted area near the Woodrow Wilson Bridge. Within minutes a Coast Guard fast boat with a large automatic weapon mounted to the bow raced to interdict.“We fight against complacency,” said Brian Kuhar, the chief petty officer of the Chock, a 65-foot small harbor tug, as he listened in on the radio conversation between the dispatcher and the fast boat. “Anything moving on the water right now doesn’t have a purpose to be here.”Washington was heavily fortified on Monday, including its cold, gray waterways. Several dozen boats from the Coast Guard, Federal Bureau of Investigation and Washington Metro Police patrolled the Potomac shoreline, looking for suspicious craft among the driftwood and scudding ducks.The radio crackled again with an update from the fast boat’s crew: “The vessel is in the creek stopped, appears to be fishing.”9:11 a.m.Silence in Section 60Huge throngs were assembling on the National Mall, but Arlington National Cemetery, normally packed with visitors, was deserted. A cold wind blew the handmade Christmas decorations on the graves in Section 60, where the war dead from Iraq and Afghanistan are buried. Many tombstones have birthdates in the 1980s.“With everything going on, it’s something you would expect,” Greg Veney, who works at the cemetery’s welcome center, said of the absence of crowds. “We think maybe after everything is over they’ll make their way here.”9:17 a.m.Lost LuggageOn the Washington Metro from Farragut North to Judiciary Square, Faye and Earl Sadberry were wondering what to wear to one of the inaugural balls. It wasn’t fashion indecision: Their airline had lost their luggage, including Mr. Sadberry’s tuxedo and Mrs. Sadberry’s ball gown.“I heard Macy’s is open later today,” Mr. Sadberry said. “We’re not giving up just yet.”10:37 a.m.Marnie at the CapitolSitting in a black folding chair front and center at the foot of the Capitol, Allison Williams — the daughter of Brian Williams, the “NBC Nightly News” anchor, and perhaps now best known for playing the character Marnie on the HBO show “Girls” — chatted with fans and posed for pictures.She also took a minute to ponder a question she called “impossible to answer:” Which is more exciting, today’s inaugural festivities or the recent Golden Globe victory for “Girls”?“They’re such different kinds of excitement,” she said. “This is a national and international and historic kind of excitement. And while I feel our show winning was momentous, it was personal for our little family, and this is something I’m sharing with half a million of my best friends.”Over all, celebrities were sparse compared with 2009. But a number turned up, including Katy Perry, John Mayer, John Legend, Beyoncé, Jay-Z and James Taylor.11:15 a.m.We Are StuckCrammed into the nonticketed area and not moving any closer long before the ceremony began, people stood shifting weight from one foot to the other on the National Mall, with little else to do but watch the comings and goings of honored guests on the Jumbotrons.For the most recognizable faces, there were cheers — and boos, reflecting the unpopularity of Congressional Republicans with this crowd.Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio, Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin and Newt Gingrich elicited waves of disapproving sounds. Scattered boos for Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the minority leader, prompted a few to turn to their friends and ask, “Who’s that?”Patty Williamson, 38, of Pasadena, Calif., volunteered for Mr. Obama’s campaign twice. As her 3-year-old daughter climbed around in her stroller, Ms. Williamson said maneuvering the crowds with a young child hadn’t been too hard to manage so far. But the sight of so many knees seemed to be getting to her daughter.“Are we stuck, Daddy?” she asked, looking up at her father as she turned around in her seat.“Yes, we are,” he said.11:30 a.m.HatsHat check from Section 3 of the inaugural platform: Four mink toppers, eight Tuskegee Airmen caps, a plaid beret and 12 white Coast Guard covers with, according to their wearers, distinctly uncomfortable bills.11:40 a.m.The Producer RelaxesGeorge Stevens Jr., who was the executive producer of the 2009 inaugural concert at the Lincoln Memorial — the one with Bruce Springsteen, Bono, Renée Fleming, Beyoncé, Garth Brooks, Herbie Hancock, Stevie Wonder and Mary J. Blige, just to name a few — was having a far more relaxed experience this time around.“It’s just a different pleasure,” he said, dressed in a peach crew-neck sweater as he held a cup of hot chocolate at the Motion Picture Association of America on I Street, where guests watched the inaugural festivities on television in the warm confines of the association’s screening room. “We had friends over last night and it was great fun. We had a huge inaugural before, so this is lower-key. I think the scale of this is just right.”NoonFlashes, Applause, QuietAs Mr. Obama took to the podium, a sea of cellphone lights, like so many fireflies, lit up from the steps of the Capitol to the Washington Monument. Mr. Obama’s references to Stonewall, gay marriage and pay equality sparked fast and loud bursts of applause, but when his words turned to Newtown, Conn., there was only quiet, enough to hear a slight wind rustle through the trees.12:15 p.m.An Old Rival ApplaudsSenator John McCain, the Arizona Republican who ran for president against Mr. Obama in 2008 and lost, was an interesting study in Inaugural Address applause. A longtime skeptic of overturning the military’s “don’t ask, don’t tell” rule, Mr. McCain clapped when the president declared, “Our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.”When Mr. Obama said that climate change must be confronted, Mr. McCain also applauded, even as several Republicans seated on the platform did not join him.After the remarks, Mr. McCain said that he wished the president would have pledged to work with Republicans, but he bluntly acknowledged, as he knows firsthand, that elections have consequences.“The president has high favorability ratings and Republicans have very low favorability ratings,” Mr. McCain said. “So he’s succeeding as far as the P.R. side of it is concerned.”1:48 p.m.Lunch at LastThe inaugural luncheon was a splendor of orange (the centerpieces, not the complexions) and odd pairings (not the New England lobster and South Dakota bison, but the seating arrangement).Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the Republican whip, got the draw many others obviously wanted. He sat next to former President Bill Clinton, who had to greet virtually everyone in attendance. The other former president at the lunch, Jimmy Carter, was seated next to Senator Dianne Feinstein, Democrat of California. Rosalynn Carter drew Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the taciturn Republican leader.Timothy F. Geithner, the departing Treasury secretary, was seated with Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, expected to soon be secretary of state. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, got plenty of time to talk over impending military cuts at the table of Representative Howard P. McKeon, Republican of California, the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.In keeping with the inaugural theme of equality, Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York, the chairman of the inaugural committee, lamented that only one woman was immortalized with a statue in the hall: Frances Willard, a suffragist and 19th-century social reformer. But he delivered news that another female face would soon be joining the assembled statuary.“Rosa Parks completes her journey from the back of the bus to the front of Statuary Hall later this year,” Mr. Schumer said.2:20 p.m.PedicabsNew York has a lot of things that Washington lacks, like good bagels, tabloid newspapers, skyscrapers — and pedicabs. So late last week, Gordon Gertsen, 32, loaded his bike onto a truck and headed to Washington, where he had heard that pedicab drivers who made a similar trip in 2009 made of lot of money on Mr. Obama’s first inauguration.He was startled by what he found.“New York is pretty dirty,” he said. “I was really surprised by how clean it was here. It’s hillier and more difficult to ride.” He added: “My legs are much more sore.”There was another challenge in navigating Washington’s circles and squares and places like K Street. “At first it was complicated to get around the Mall, how to get through the alphabets, the monuments, the hotels; a lot of people wanted to be taken to the subway,” he said.In the end, his balance sheet wasn’t inspiring. Friday and Saturday were not very profitable, he said, although business picked up on Sunday, when he made about $700. “I probably did a little better than break even,” he said.3 p.m.Empty Bar StoolsPerhaps it was the afternoon sunshine or simply the case that a second act is not as big of a draw as the first, but the city’s hot spots were not nearly as bustling as they were during Mr. Obama’s first inauguration.The fireplace was crackling at Adour, the fashionable bar at the St. Regis, but getting a table was a cinch. Sitting just two blocks from the White House, the pace at the St. Regis — the hotel of choice for the president’s most prolific fund-raisers — was far slower than in 2009. “Four years ago, people were packed in here,” a server said. “You couldn’t see across the lobby. Where is everyone?”The weather was far more seasonable this time, which seemed to draw more people to the parade route along Pennsylvania Avenue. But that wasn’t the only explanation: Fewer campaign contributors made the trip to Washington, several donors said, not out of a lack of enthusiasm for Mr. Obama’s second term, but more out of a reluctance to deal with the hassles of a trip. The California contingent, for example, was significantly smaller than four years ago.4 p.m.DronesAs the crowds left the inaugural ceremony, protesters a few blocks from the Capitol held large pictures of children they said were killed in drone attacks. “King had a dream,” one of them yelled. “Obama has a drone.”8:30 p.m.Making the CurveAs the temperatures dropped, partygoers gasped as they encountered a line snaking around the block to get into the two inaugural balls at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center. Some argued with volunteers, claiming others had cut ahead, but many stuck it out, bracing against an icy wind in little more than their gowns and tuxedos. This late into the inaugural day, they could only celebrate the little victories.As one woman exulted as she progressed through the line, “We made the curve!”The night had just begun."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/ncaafootball/joyner-officially-named-penn-state-athletic-director.html,"STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) — Penn State has removed the “acting” designation from the title of Athletic Director Dave Joyner.The school on Monday also formally announced that Joyner would stay on until the end of President Rodney Erickson’s term in 2014.Both Erickson and Joyner assumed their posts as part of the fallout in the opening weeks of the child molestation scandal involving former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky in November 2011.Joyner had the title of acting athletic director until Monday. A school spokeswoman said the statement served to announce the title change.Erickson in September had already said that Joyner would remain on the job until the end of the president’s tenure.Penn State said a national search for a new athletic director would take place at that time. "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/world/africa/coup-attempt-fails-in-eritrea.html,"GARSEN, Kenya — Eritrea, a sliver of a nation in the Horn of Africa that is one of the most secretive and repressive countries in the world, was cast into confusion on Monday after mutinous soldiers stormed the Ministry of Information and took over the state-run television service, apparently in a coup attempt.According to several people with close contacts inside Eritrea, the coup attempt failed, with government troops quelling the would-be rebellion and no one rising up in the streets. But many analysts said it was only a matter of time before President Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea’s brash and steely leader for the past 20 years, is confronted again — and most likely from within.“There’s a lot of dissatisfaction within the armed forces,” said Dan Connell, a professor at Simmons College in Boston and the author of several books on Eritrea. “If this is suppressed, it won’t be the end.”Eritrea is often called the North Korea of Africa because it is so isolated and authoritarian, with few friends and thousands of defectors in recent years as Mr. Isaias tightens his grip and the economy teeters on the brink of ruin.In the early 1990s, when Mr. Isaias first took power, Eritrea was hailed as a beacon of hope in Africa, a country of low crime, ethnic harmony and can-do spirit along the Red Sea. The Eritreans fought for years in trenches and from craggy mountaintops to defeat a Soviet-backed Ethiopian government and win their independence.But the euphoria did not last. In the late 1990s, Eritrea and Ethiopia waged a costly war over their shared border, in which tens of thousands of people died. Shortly afterward, Mr. Isaias rounded up political dissidents and journalists, dooming them to years in prison, often in sweltering, underground shipping containers.Thousands of young Eritreans have been drafted into the army and then required to work indefinitely for the government for pittance wages in what is called “national service.” Each year, many young people risk their lives to escape. Eritrea has waged war with just about all of its neighbors, and the United Nations has imposed sanctions on Eritrea over what is suspected to be its support of Somali militants.By nightfall on Monday, it seemed that the government had beaten back the mutineers, with some analysts saying that the government broadcaster, Eri-TV, was back on the air.The rebel soldiers, believed to number around 100, made it as far as the director’s office in the Ministry of Information, forcing him to read a statement on air calling for the release of political prisoners. Then the broadcast abruptly cut out. They also may have briefly taken hostage Mr. Isaias’s daughter, Elsa, who is said to work in the ministry.It was not clear what happened to the renegade soldiers; analysts said that troops loyal to the government had surrounded the Ministry of Information and that the mutineers would most likely be captured and imprisoned.The State Department said that the situation remained fluid, and the small embassy in Asmara, Eritrea’s capital, sent out a warning on Monday to the few American citizens living there. “The U.S. Embassy has been made aware of increased military presence in some sections of Asmara,” the warning said. “Employees of the U.S. government have been advised to limit their movements within the city, avoid large gatherings and exercise caution. We strongly recommend that private U.S. citizens do likewise.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/arts/music/oberlin-conservatory-plays-at-dimenna-center-and-carnegie.html,"Musicians representing the esteemed Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio established a residency in New York last week, and the classical segment began on Friday evening with a contemporary program at the DiMenna Center for Classical Music. Fittingly, it featured the flutist Claire Chase, an Oberlin alumna and founding member of the International Contemporary Ensemble, also known as ICE.New music is an important element of an Oberlin education, and alumni often speak of the entrepreneurial and creative approach fostered by the school, which encourages students to think imaginatively about establishing a niche in the field. The International Contemporary Ensemble, the equally innovative group Eighth Blackbird, and any number of enterprising individuals, like the pianist Jeremy Denk, the violinist Jennifer Koh, the composer Huang Ruo and Ms. Chase (who received a MacArthur Foundation “genius” grant last year), are all products of Oberlin’s undergraduate program.Friday’s concert featured the Oberlin Contemporary Music Ensemble, conducted by Timothy Weiss, and members of ICE. Ms. Chase was joined by another flutist, Alexa Still, in “Altar of Two Serpents,” by Mario Diaz de León, an engaging work that lived up to its title with eerie, serpentine lines coiled in interlocking patterns. In his 2010 piece “alphabeta” Eric Wubbels meshes unpitched percussion sounds with pitched piano timbres, producing a colorful dialogue.The program’s oldest work was Luciano Berio’s “Corale (su Sequenza VIII),” from 1981, in which the composer expands a virtuosic piece for solo violin to include string orchestra and horns. Mr. Weiss conducted an alluring performance, with David Bowlin as the brilliant violin soloist, traversing his complicated part with ferocious intensity.The evening also included David Lang’s “sweet air,” whose unassuming fragments create dancelike rhythms and gentle dissonance, and the premiere of John Zorn’s “Tempest,” for flute, clarinet and drums. Ms. Chase joined the clarinetist Joshua Rubin and the percussionist Nathan Davis in the Zorn work, whose sprightly, scampering melodies mesh deftly with percussion. The program was repeated later on Friday night to accommodate the demand.A large and enthusiastic crowd also attended the Carnegie Hall concert of the Oberlin Orchestra, conducted by Raphael Jiménez, on Saturday night.After a tightly wrought rendition of “La Valse,” by Ravel, which vividly conveyed the work’s ominous shadings, Mr. Denk joined the orchestra for Mozart’s Piano Concerto No. 21 in C. His joyous and beautifully colored playing resulted in an interpretation notable for its warmth, passion and fleet-fingered passagework. The strings played with spirit, polish and elegant phrasing in the introductory section, although balance and tempos were not always perfectly coordinated between orchestra and soloist.The young Oberlin musicians also demonstrated their prowess in Stravinsky’s “Firebird” Suite, giving a stirring, vividly shaped rendition that featured exemplary playing from the woodwinds.The program included “Iscariot,” a dark-hued and emotionally intense work by Christopher Rouse, a prominent Oberlin graduate. Its shimmering string chorales, played with commitment in its New York premiere, at times recalled Samuel Barber and were punctuated by dissonant shadings, dramatic outbursts and eerie writing for winds and celesta. The audience responded with an enthusiastic ovation."

Then a club owner offers to pay off their contract if they will agree not to play. Michelle Pfeiffer, above with Jeff Bridges, is Susie Diamond, who helps the guys reinvent themselves as a trio. Writing in The New York Times, Janet Maslin called this film, from the director Steve Kloves, a “slow, teasing, rapturously moody romance.”2:05 P.M. (HBO Signature) PAUL (2011) He looks like any other extraterrestrial, with his otherworldly cast, bald bobble head, big eyes and stick limbs. Until you get to the board shorts and the backpack. In other words, Paul, voiced by Seth Rogen and the title character of this comedy from Greg Mottola, is a little green dude. And he comes in peace, man, despite causing havoc while he tries to phone home. Simon Pegg and Nick Frost are the best friends, fresh from a Comic-Con convention in San Diego, who run into Paul as they guide their recreational vehicle toward Area 51, the military base in Nevada where the conspiracy-minded think the government stashes aliens. Jason Bateman is one of the men in black hunting Paul; Kristen Wiig is the love interest who wears a T-shirt depicting Jesus blowing away Darwin; and John Carroll Lynch is her daddy, a member of the Bible and gun club. “As genial, foolish and demographically engineered as it sounds (hailing all fan boys and girls), ‘Paul’ is at once a buddy flick and a classic American road movie of self- (and other) discovery, interspersed with buckets of expletives and some startling (especially for a big-studio release) pokes at Christian fundamentalism,” Manohla Dargis wrote in The Times.8 P.M. (Ovation) THE SCAPEGOAT (2012)  Based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, this film, written and directed by Charles Sturridge, stars Matthew Rhys as John Standing, a prep school teacher of Greek in 1952 Britain. He steps into the shoes of a man of privilege who is his mirror image and suddenly finds himself responsible for a young wife, two mistresses, a morphine-abusing mother, a precocious daughter, a dilapidated if stately home and a bankrupt business.9 P.M.

(Cinemax) BLUE VELVET (1986) David Lynch probes a murder in Lumberton — “the town that knows how much wood a woodchuck chucks,” and where the sound of the falling timber tells you the time — in this surreal foray into suburbia for which he received a best director Oscar nomination. Kyle MacLachlan plays Jeffrey Beaumont, the film’s hero, who discovers a severed ear lying in tall grass and begins tracing its origin. That leads to a detective (George Dickerson) and his curious daughter (Laura Dern), who says she “hears things — bits and pieces” about the item in question. Isabella Rossellini, above, is the torch singer who becomes the object of Jeffrey’s desire, and Dennis Hopper is the resident psycho. “For those with the temerity to follow it anywhere, ‘Blue Velvet’ is as fascinating as it is freakish,” Janet Maslin wrote in The Times. “It confirms Mr. Lynch’s stature as an innovator, a superb technician and someone best not encountered in a dark alley.”10 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/arts/music/the-lone-bellow-releases-a-new-album.html,"With its stately brownstones and trendy cafes, the Park Slope neighborhood in Brooklyn might seem an unlikely place to produce a Southern country-rock trio. But the members of the Lone Bellow are all transplants there from small Southern towns, and though they have made a life in Brooklyn, their stomping, acoustic sound seems rooted in the places they grew up, drawing on that region’s country, soul, gospel and folk.“I call it country-soul,” said Kanene Pipkin, one of the members.That is a marketable mix these days, as Americana bands like Mumford & Sons and the Lumineers have had solid hits on the rock charts, racking up multiple Grammy nominations. Record producers are looking for the next band that can tap that audience, and executives at Descendant Records, a boutique division of Sony Music Entertainment, are placing their bets on the Lone Bellow.“From a marketing point of view, that’s the people we are targeting, people who are into great Americana with a rock edge to it,” Jay Harren, a Descendant vice president, said. “It’s a great time for this type of music right now.”The band has recently attracted attention from NPR, which showcased its new, self-titled debut album on the influential “First Listen” Web page, and it has been highlighted as a band to watch in 2013 by Entertainment Weekly, Billboard and Paste magazine. WFUV, the Fordham University radio station that often breaks alternative bands in New York, has broadcast the Lone Bellow’s live performances and has given its single “You Never Need Nobody” heavy airplay. On Tuesday the trio will release its debut in stores; last week the album was offered on iTunes, where one track was featured as single of the week.The heart of the Lone Bellow’s appeal is its close harmonies: three singers whose timbres meld seamlessly even at full volume. Yet there is little about their music that recalls the Nashville pop-country trios in vogue like Lady Antebellum and the Band Perry. Theirs is more rough-edged, closer to the pounding, anthemic folk-rock that Mumford & Sons has popularized.“On the surface they seem like a country or bluegrass band, but they understand the dynamics of rock,” said Rita Houston, WFUV’s music director. “This can translate into a big rock sound.”The Lone Bellow is one of several Americana groups the club owner Ken Rockwood has nurtured at the Rockwood Music Hall on the Lower East Side. The band recorded its album in the club, persuading Charlie Peacock, the Nashville producer who produced the Civil Wars’ gold album, “Barton Hollow,” to work the soundboard.“We had high hopes of trying to capture the moments that we had felt happen in this room over and over again,” the frontman, Zach Williams, said after performing for a private party at Rockwood this month. “Our music is connected to the wood on this stage.”Mr. Williams is a 31-year-old singer-songwriter from Acworth, Ga., who has been knocking around the New York folk circuit since 2006. But he attracted little label interest before he started the trio in the fall of 2010, recruiting his longtime friends Ms. Pipkin, a singer and mandolin player, and Brian Elmquist, a rockabilly singer and guitarist.“He called me and said, ‘Let’s start a honky-tonk project,’ ” Mr. Elmquist recalled, laughing. “He didn’t know what honky-tonk meant at all.”The two are part of a tight-knit circle of friends who followed Mr. Williams to New York to pursue music careers. Mr. Elmquist had known Mr. Williams since they were college students together in Lynchburg, Va. Ms. Pipkin is the sister of another college friend of Mr. Williams’s. Like most struggling musicians, they have day jobs: Ms. Pipkin is a pastry chef, Mr. Elmquist a waiter and Mr. Williams the music director for a small church.Mr. Williams said that songwriting had been a way to process the pain and bewilderment in his life. He started writing songs as a newlywed in 2005 in a hospital room after his wife, Stacy, broke her neck in a horseback-riding accident and was temporarily paralyzed. Singing helped him cope, and when, against the odds, she recovered, he kept writing. “These songs were written out of necessity,” he said.In September 2010 the trio went to work on a set of anguished songs that Mr. Williams had written while on a trip to Mexico with Stacy, a love cycle about a relationship severely tested and renewed. The material seems made to order for what is called the triple-A radio format, or “adult album alternative.”Lyrically, the songs are mature meditations about marital strife that skirt maudlin clichés. They have big, rollicking, ready-for-country-radio choruses like “You never need nobody” and “You don’t love me like you used to.”The band’s live performances can be gut-wrenching. Wearing a bow tie and vest, Mr. Williams performs with an emotional intensity that leaves him perspiring and gasping for breath.“When we play a show, I can experience the feelings of betrayal all the way to the feelings of utter hope and redemption,” he said. He seems to strive to provoke an ecstatic reaction, like a clean-cut cross between James Brown and an evangelical preacher. Mr. Elmquist’s solid vocals and hollow-body electric guitar add a rumbling rockabilly energy, while Ms. Pipkin’s mellifluous voice sweetens the upper register.“The reason we have to be so visceral is that the songs are visceral, and we want people not to be afraid to explore that side of themselves,” said Ms. Pipkin, 27, who is from Fredericksburg, Va.Mr. Elmquist, 31, from Sandersville, Ga., said the three-part harmonies the trio has become known for reflect a strong R&B influence, laid over country-song structures. “We all grew up with R&B, but listening to country music on the radio,” he said.Mr. Harren, the record executive, said the next step in developing the band would be three months of intensive touring, starting as the opening act for Dwight Yoakam this week. The band will also appear on Conan O’Brien’s TBS show on Tuesday.The coming months will be a make-or-break test. All three are quitting their jobs and planning to tour without their spouses.“We just want to feel what it’s like out there, live,” Mr. Elmquist said. “We want to see what resonates from this record.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/sports/basketball/joe-johnsons-late-basket-helps-nets-edge-knicks.html,"The opportunity was there for the Knicks. They entered Monday’s game with a chance to win the season series against the Nets.Instead, the Knicks could not stop the Nets in the final minute, falling, 88-85, at Madison Square Garden. For the first time since November, the Nets are only a game behind the Knicks in the Atlantic Division.The Knicks rallied in the third quarter with a 10-0 surge to seemingly take control of the game. They forced the Nets into 19 turnovers, including six steals by Jason Kidd. To make matters worse for the Nets, they were held without a point for five minutes in the fourth quarter. But Joe Johnson, the coveted off-season acquisition, played like a star, finally, when the Nets were desperate for a basket, scoring a team-high 25 points. His most important shot came on a fadeaway jumper over J. R. Smith with 22.3 seconds remaining that gave the Nets an 85-84 lead.“I thought we did a good job defensively,” Tyson Chandler said. “Joe Johnson made some tough shots. Our effort was there, but you have to give them credit. They beat us.”Carmelo Anthony had his opportunity to give the Knicks the victory, but he shot an air ball — missing the backboard and the rim — on a difficult, off-balanced baseline jumper with 12 seconds remaining.Anthony led the Knicks with 29 points but was often off target, hitting just 11 of 29 shots.“I missed it,” he said of his final shot. “I didn’t execute, and I didn’t make shots down the stretch. I should have made those shots.”Smith tried to force overtime with a 3-pointer as time expired, but the shot bounced off the rim.“I kind of altered my shot a little bit,” Smith said. “They had three hands in my face. They did a good job of contesting.”The win for the Nets was critical as they split the season series two games apiece. If both teams finished the season with the same record, the tiebreaker would be their division records. The Nets have a 9-3 record against Atlantic opponents. The Knicks are 4-3.“If we’re talking about staying at the top and winning our division, you can’t have any hiccups,” Knicks Coach Mike Woodson said before the game. “This game is very important, and we have to treat it that way.”Since P. J. Carlesimo took over for Avery Johnson, the Nets have won 11 of 13 games. They are trying to figure out what kind of team they are — the group that won 11 games in November, the team that lost 10 of 13 games in December, or the one that has surged under Carlesimo.As significant as the win was for the Nets (25-16), it also validated their resurgence under Carlesimo and established that they can contend with the Knicks (25-14) for the division title for the remainder of the season.That realization for the Knicks seemed to upset Smith the most after the game.“Being 2-2 against them stinks,” he said. “It’s like kissing your sister. We just have to figure out a way to win divisional games.”The Knicks have lost their last two divisional games — both at home — and have two more coming on the road, against the Boston Celtics on Thursday and the Philadelphia 76ers on Saturday.“We have to get that win,” Smith said of playing the Celtics, who beat them, 102-96, two weeks ago.Losing at the Garden is the biggest concern for Smith. The Knicks started the season 10-0 at home, but have lost 6 of their last 10 games there.“We have a great crowd, and for us not to play the way we’re capable of — and always having to fight back in the second half — is disrespectful to them, and we should be embarrassed by it,” he said.The feeling in the Knicks’ locker room was different from when they embarrassed the Nets, 100-86, to push their lead in the division to six games a month ago. The Knicks know they cannot ignore the Nets, even though the two teams will not face each other in the second half of the season.“I think it’s going to be a nice fight down the stretch for the division,” Chandler said.REBOUNDSAmar’e Stoudemire provided pregame lunch for Madison Square Garden employees to honor the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. ...The restriction on Iman Shumpert’s minutes was increased to 20 before the game, Mike Woodson said. Shumpert, who played his second game of the season against the Nets, was asked to guard Joe Johnson. “I’m going to try to play him in five-minute spurts,” Woodson said. Shumpert finished with 2 points and 4 rebounds. ...Raymond Felton, who has been out since Dec. 25 with a fracture right pinkie finger, hopes to return for Saturday’s game. “That’s what I’m hoping for,” Felton said before Monday’s game. Woodson was more cautious about Felton and said he did not know when Felton would be cleared for full-contact practices. ...In the first quarter, Tyson Chandler received a technical for yelling at a referee after his follow-up dunk. It was Chandler’s seventh technical of the season. ...The Knicks declined to comment on whether microphones were used to monitor what was said to Carmelo Anthony, as they were during the previous two home games. There did not appear to be any parabolic microphones near the court, but it was unclear if there were microphones located elsewhere."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/world/europe/bolshoi-theater-director-acid-attack.html,"MOSCOW — Galina Stepanenko, a former principal dancer with the Bolshoi Ballet, was named the company’s acting artistic director on Tuesday, taking over for Sergei Filin, who was severely burned last week when a masked man threw acid in his face. In an interview published on Tuesday, Mr. Filin said he regretted not accepting protection after receiving threats in mid-December.Anatoly Iksanov, the theater’s general director, told reporters that Mr. Filin would undergo another eye operation on Wednesday. He said that he was certain that Mr. Filin would return to his post and that doctors would be able make prognoses about his vision in 10 days to 2 weeks, Interfax reported.Mr. Iksanov said he suspected that the goal of the attack on Mr. Filin was to destabilize the theater, which has no security service since “we are neither a military organization nor a business structure,” and added that “psychologically, even we don’t really comprehend the entire extent of possible risks.”Mr. Filin, who spoke to the newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda, said that he blamed himself for not taking the threats seriously enough and that he had turned down an offer of a driver and a bodyguard. He did not say who made the offer, but decided simply to follow Mr. Iksanov’s urgings to “be brave and find the strength within yourself to not react to these threats.”Mr. Filin said that he believed that he was attacked because of his work at the ballet company, and that investigators had a good chance of identifying his assailant.“When everything is going well, that may also displease someone,” Mr. Filin said when asked whether the attack was planned by someone within the company. “But I don’t want to talk too much about this subject; let the investigators do that. They will definitely find the answer.”Mr. Filin’s interview, which was posted online early on Tuesday, is sure to revive speculation about a crime that has left Moscow’s cultural circles aghast. Police officials have said that they are looking into various theories, including a dispute over money or business, but officials at the Bolshoi and associates of Mr. Filin said that they were sure that the crime would be traced to a professional grudge.Mr. Filin made comments in the same interview about dissent within the company and added that he thought the attack could have been prevented. “If today a decision does not result from the attack on me,” he said, “I don’t know what needs to happen in our country, so that the leadership of the country and the security services will pay attention.”He said the Bolshoi’s company was internationally recognized as the world’s best, but “from inside, we always hear some sort of dissatisfaction,” adding, “It is important to put a stop to these conversations.”Stepping in for him as artistic director is Ms. Stepanenko, who is 46 and has been with the Bolshoi since 1990. She ended her performing career in December 2012 to become an instructor with the troupe. She studied at the Russian Academy of Theater Art, and early in her career was a soloist with the Moscow Classical Ballet.According to Komsomolsakaya Pravda, Mr. Filin was in good spirits and optimistic about his recovery, saying he cared very little about physical disfigurement and was focused on continuing his work at the Bolshoi. He said the acid had hit his right eye and caused serious damage, and that “they promise to save the left eye.”“I am not in bad spirits,” he said. “Sometimes I am able to see all the fingers on my hand. This gives rise to optimism and hope.”He went on to say that the acid attack was far less painful than an experience he once had onstage, when he danced “Swan Lake” on a broken leg, because his mother was sitting in the front row and he didn’t want to disappoint her.“I understood that if they shut the curtain and announced that something had happened to me, Mama would not tolerate that,” he said. “So I danced until intermission.”Mr. Filin’s mother, Natalya Filina, told the newspaper Vechernyaya Moskva in an interview posted online on Monday that the family’s New Year’s holiday was marred by a sense of doom from the threats to her son. She told the newspaper that Mr. Filin had received nearly 800 threatening phone calls.“He told me, ‘Mama, they’ve ordered a hit on me!’ ”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/dining/creative-cheesemongers-pen-clever-descriptions.html,"They can tell you about torment. They can describe long, frustrating hours sitting in dark, stinky basements and caves, pen in hand, trying to get the flow of the words just right.They can tell you, too, about how it feels to be engulfed in a blaze of inspiration. They’ll describe the delirium of bliss when the right lines come. Like all writers, they are keenly aware of the competition,and envy eats away at them when they detect, in one of their comrades, a candle-flicker of genius.We speak, naturally, of cheesemongers.Although not universally acknowledged as members of New York’s creative class, the people who sell cheese arguably deserve a place of recognition alongside the poets and the playwrights, the folk singers and the indie screenwriters.In case you haven’t noticed, some of the most amusing and captivating writing in the city is being produced in the service of cheese.Consider, for starters, Martin Johnson, 52, who manages the cheese, charcuterie and other treats at Gastronomie 491, a market and cafe on the Upper West Side. Look into the display case that Mr. Johnson oversees there, and your first response may be confusion. So many cheeses, so many names.“Adelegger,” Mr. Johnson said the other day. “Does that really mean anything to you?”Well, no.“Exactly,” he said. Even if you learn that Adelegger is Bavarian and that it is made of raw cow’s milk — fine, but what does it taste like?Mr. Johnson conveys the flavor this way, on a small sign in that display case: “Just think of a scene in a movie where the lead actress, obviously one of the greats, turns around slowly and walks away from the camera taking your entire attention with her.”Now do you want some Adelegger? If so, then Mr. Johnson has done his job, which is to use lyrical wit and subtle cultural references to lure customers into taking home a wedge of the rare and unfamiliar cheeses that he adores.Mr. Johnson’s labels have a following, in part because they practically dare you to suss out the allusions he’s dropping. In the Adelegger sign, he said, “The actress I was thinking of is Maggie Cheung, and the movie is ‘In the Mood for Love.’ ” For Calcagno, he has opted for rock ’n’ roll: “Big and floral in the very best way possible, this firm Sardinian sheep has the cool unaffected strut of Mick in his prime, Lou in middle age or Polly Jean today.”That last part is a nod to the singer and songwriter P. J. Harvey, but so far Mr. Johnson hasn’t had to provide anyone with explanatory footnotes.Mr. Johnson is just one of many skilled cheese wits around the city. Just this month, in fact, a cheesemonger named Peter Daniels, known as The Doctor, briefly had to reel in his reference-studded musings at Westside Market after a nod to Nostradamus caused a customer to complain.The man often pointed to as both the Mark Twain and the Ricky Roma of fromage-inspired belles-lettres is Steve Jenkins, the volcanically passionate expert on cheese (and many other products) at Fairway Market.Thanks to him, a sign-browsing stroll through Fairway will reveal many delights, like this billing for Queijo de Serpa: “It is still made only at night, I am led to believe, as it was when I last visited the cheesemaker, and what I haven’t told you is Serpa’s texture and flavor are like sex. There’s just no other way to describe the effect this cheese has on me. Even though I barely remember sex.”As many shoppers know, Mr. Jenkins, 62, engages in what could be described as a complicated relationship with his clientele. The old saw that the customer is always right? He has never quite subscribed to that. “The customer has no idea what he or she wants,” he said. “The customer is dying to be told what they want.”Hence the cheese signs: they strive to tantalize someone who is momentarily adrift in an aromatic sea of choices.“Sales are provoked by an intelligent sign,” Mr. Jenkins added. “The sign tells them what to do. Their desires are defined by that sign.”Surprisingly, though, Mr. Jenkins began honing his distinctive style —  simultaneously sensual and comically biting — more than 30 years ago when he was “going to blow my brains out,” he said, as a result of too much personal interaction with shoppers at the counter. Hiding in a back room and summoning the cheese-sign muse was a way “to avoid old ladies,” he said. “Because I was going to get fired. Because I would insult them. I would write signs for hours.”Mr. Jenkins’s pioneering work helped to answer a marketplace conundrum, said Tia Keenan, a cheese expert who is an active part of the New York scene: “How do you sell something that’s perceived as fancy, foreign, intimidating to the customer? How do you sell this product to someone who doesn’t have any context?”Before long, as Mr. Jenkins views it, copycats began cropping up all over town — and across America. “They’ve totally ripped me off,” he said.Maybe so, but each of the genuine cheese wits tends to have a prose style that is instantly identifiable, at least to colleagues. It’s hard to imagine that a competitor could — or even would —  try to mimic one stridently Jenkinsian trait: Although most of his cheese signs are engineered to make you want to buy cheese, some aim to do the opposite.Take his less-than-rousing pitch for an aged mimolette: “It was Charles de Gaulle’s favorite cheese, which figures. He was an army man, and God knows army men are not too particular about what they put in their mouths. Even aged a year, mimolette is not exactly startling.”At the Harlem branch of Fairway, there is a large, prominent sign describing the various qualities of different cheeses. Between “Strong & Gooshy” and “Creamy & Dreamy,” Mr. Jenkins has squeezed in a category that most grocery stores endeavor to avoid: “Bland & Forgettable.”Among those deemed “Bland & Forgettable” are the popular havarti, Muenster, Jarlsberg and Saga Blue.“I have no patience for people who don’t want the best of everything,” he explained. “You’re in a world-class store and you’re buying Saga Blue? Grow up.”If Mr. Jenkins has had a friendly sparring partner along the way, that would be Rob Kaufelt, the owner of Murray’s Cheese Shop, who likes to refer to the writing on cheese signs as “romance copy.”“Jenkins and I used to sit down in the cellar and try to top each other with pithy signs,” Mr. Kaufelt, 65, recalled. (This would have been in the early 1990s, he said, during a brief period when Mr. Jenkins worked for Dean & DeLuca.) “That was fun. And that’s a good education. As a literary exercise, it can’t be beat.”He warmed to the theme. “Of course I’m much better. He peaked way back. Way back. I’m still on the upswing here.” He offered, tongue-in-cheek, a literary analogue. “I would say it’s Fitzgerald and Hemingway. I’m Fitzgerald and he’s Hemingway. Or maybe it’s more like Mailer and Roth. Mailer and James Jones. Whoever’s pugnacious.”Pugnacious is one thing. Transgressive is another. If Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Kaufelt represent the old guard in cheese-signery, the punk-rock misfits can be found at the Bedford Cheese Shop, in Brooklyn and Manhattan, where one notorious eye-grabber, courtesy of an owner, Charlotte Kamin, is so scatologically envelope-pushing that it cannot be reprinted here.“Oh, that’s her famous nasty one,” said Stephanie Bealert, a cheesemonger at Bedford. “I hate that sign. It’s just gross. But it’s funny. People love that sign.”Another sign at Bedford likens the effect of Tomme de Berger on one’s senses to the enthusiasm of “a gay schoolboy going to see a Britney Spears concert.” “It relaxes people so that they want to have a conversation about them,” Ms. Bealert said of the humor in the signs. “People will say to me, ‘I want to taste the one that has that silly description.’ It opens up a conversation.”There are gentler ways to break the ice, of course. At Saxelby Cheesemongers, on the Lower East Side, the signs are jotted down, like postcards from a vacationing friend, in Anne Saxelby’s own handwriting, and the descriptions seem to capture her winsome, Midwestern sense of enthusiasm in real time. Of one goat cheese from Vermont, Ms. Saxelby, 31, has written, “My reaction when I first tried this cheese was: Dear God. Yes, it was nearly the perfect cheese.”“It all reflects her personality,” said Sophie Slesinger, a member of the Saxelby team. “It is not as hip or lewd as some of the stuff out there, but it still gets the point across. We keep it a little more family-friendly.”(In reality, the cheese signs have been composed by countless people over the years, but each shop has its own idiosyncratic voice, usually a reflection of the person in charge.)If it occasionally seems as if the city’s reigning cheesemongers haul around the souls of frustrated artists, that’s probably because many do. Behind the counter at your neighborhood shop you’re highly likely to encounter dancers, musicians, poets and journalists who happen to have a fixation on fermented dairy products. “We’re artsy, dorky people,” Ms. Bealert said.Take Mr. Johnson from Gastronomie 491, who has written about jazz for an array of publications, including The Wall Street Journal. He, like many of his fellow cheese pundits, has standards to uphold when he’s composing his fromagic odes. He works hard to make sure his signs are both approachable and erudite. Allusions to Alvin Ailey and “Argo”? No problem.“But I don’t want to associate Taylor Swift with cheese,” he said. “I’m sorry.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/business/media/nash-fm-brings-country-music-back-to-new-york-radio.html,"Country music is all over television, on dramas like “Nashville” and talent competitions like “American Idol.” Country stars are among the most consistent moneymakers in the concert industry. The genre’s growing sales are among the few bright lights of the music industry.But until this week, the country format was nowhere to be found on the New York radio dial.On Monday, Cumulus Media introduced Nash FM, which ended country music’s 17-year drought on New York radio. The station provides the first glimpse of what Cumulus says will be an all-purpose vehicle to market what it calls the “country lifestyle” on dozens of its radio stations across the country as well as online, on television and in a new magazine.The new station, WRXP, at 94.7 FM, fills a conspicuous gap in the nation’s largest media market. It is also an indication of how strong the country genre has become, not only in music but also in the broader popular culture, led by telegenic young acts like Taylor Swift and the group Lady Antebellum.“The time is right to put together a multiplatform entertainment brand,” Lew Dickey, chief executive of Cumulus, said in an interview on Tuesday. “Country is at an all-time high.”While country has been heard on some suburban stations over the years, the city has been without a country station since 1996, when WYNY changed to a pop format and became WKTU. The music industry has been pressing the big broadcasters for years to start a station to help promote country acts, whose tours sometimes bypass the city for theaters in New Jersey and elsewhere.“We’ve been begging the major broadcasters to jump in with us,” said Scott Borchetta, president of the label Big Machine, whose acts include Ms. Swift, Tim McGraw and the Band Perry. “The market has changed so dramatically over the last 15 or 16 years since we’ve had a country station in New York City proper. I think our music is now in the best possible alignment with what can work.”Variations on the “Nash” name will be used throughout Cumulus’s 83 country stations as well as its other country-themed media efforts, the company said. For example, Mr. Dickey said that Cumulus would start Nash Magazine, published by Modern Luxury, which will begin publication in the second half of the year. Down the line, he added, he wants to expand into video. “This will be the flagship of a national country brand,” Mr. Dickey said.Cumulus operates a total of 525 stations, and is the nation’s second-largest broadcaster, behind Clear Channel Communications.Broadcasters sometimes go to great lengths to keep format changes secret, and the case of Nash FM was no different. Cumulus assigned WRXP, the call letters of a former rock station, to the frequency, and over the weekend played a jumble of different formats to stir up interest while also cloaking its intentions to go country. (Next week the station will become WNSH.)A success in New York could help propel Nash FM to prominence and draw new kinds of advertising. The market has nearly 16 million listeners age 12 and above, according to the ratings service Arbitron, and the city offers plenty of opportunities for promotional events, like concerts, that can be syndicated throughout Cumulus’s network.New York may be the ultimate symbol of American urbanism, but it is a large market for country music. Last year, Nielsen said that more country albums were sold in the New York metropolitan area than anywhere in the United States — although as a proportion of all music sales in the region, New York ranks far below less populous areas in the South and Midwest.With the fragmentation of media, country has been available to New York fans in plenty of other ways. Sirius XM Radio, for example, has six country stations, and last year it put on a concert for its listeners by Mr. McGraw at the Beacon Theater in Manhattan.But music executives say that having a terrestrial station in the area will be a major help in selling concert tickets and promoting new music. The first song played on the new station on Monday was “How Country Feels” by Randy Houser, who performs on Thursday at the Mercury Lounge in Manhattan.“It makes a statement that country music is strong and that country music is important,” said Greg Oswald of William Morris Endeavor in Nashville. “If you are willing to do it in New York City, then it’s saying everything that needs to be said.”Even with country’s broad popularity, building a steady audience in New York for a genre of music that has been absent from the airwaves for so long might take time.“If you look at the other major markets that have a successful country station — Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, Detroit — those stations planted a stake in the ground and stayed with it, and now those stations are practically iconic,” said Mr. Borchetta, of Big Machine. “The country radio audience doesn’t spike. It grows in a beautiful, slow arc.”Another challenge for Cumulus will be defining exactly what the country lifestyle means in New York.“It’s an exurban lifestyle,” Mr. Dickey said. “It’s the five boroughs, the whole tristate area.”He added, “We’re not just talking to people on the Upper West Side.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/arts/music/christopher-owens-at-the-bowery-ballroom.html,"For the moment Christopher Owens has settled on an era. As the leader of the band Girls, he hopscotched among retro possibilities: surf-rock, punk, folk-rock, 1970s John Lennon. Now, with his first solo album, “Lysandre,” he has narrowed his time frame and genre choice to late-1960s folk-pop.That was the domain of earnest, fingerpicking songwriters who, when ambitious, might write an autobiographical, album-length suite, which is what Mr. Owens did with “Lysandre” (Fat Possum/Turnstile). Those songwriters were backed by neatly understated studio bands that could play upbeat folk-rock or diffident ballads — with a flute, perhaps, along with a drummer with a light touch and some unobtrusive female singers. And that was the kind of band — two backup singers, five instrumentalists — that Mr. Owens brought to the Bowery Ballroom on Monday night to play “Lysandre” faithfully, start to finish.“If your heart is broken, you will find a fellowship with me,” an introductory lyric announced. Most of the songs lead back into “Lysandre’s Theme,” a melody that appears first as a waltz and later as a quasi-Caribbean lilt; between those refrains, the songs trace a love affair pulled apart by a band’s first tour. “You were a part of me,” Mr. Owens concluded. “Now that part of me is gone.”On the album, the effect is studied, a period piece, a little arch. But onstage, where Mr. Owens wore a jacket and tie and played the ballads seated and the up-tempo songs standing up, “Lysandre” somehow gathered sincerity. Mr. Owens had found the era’s blend of narcissism and modesty, and his voice, unassertive but direct, became more a reminiscence than a pose.The arc of a love affair — as Paul Simon, who perfected late-1960s folk-pop, would put it — was in the songs, even as “Lysandre’s Theme” insisted on framing the story. Mr. Owens was at once contemporary and backdated.But the songs from the album spanned about half an hour. What to do for the rest of the set? Folk-pop from the 1960s into 1970: Cat Stevens, Donovan, Simon and Garfunkel, the Everly Brothers and Bob Dylan, played as competently, as, perhaps, a cover band in 1970. Since recording “Lysandre,” Mr. Owens apparently hasn’t added any material of his own to his chosen period idiom. Perhaps he’s already planning to move elsewhere."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/arts/music/budapest-festival-orchestra-at-avery-fisher-hall.html,"At a time when it seems that every other movie is enhanced with 3-D technology, it is rare to be awed by a stereophonic experience. No glasses were required at Sunday’s concert by the Budapest Festival Orchestra under the direction of Ivan Fischer, who created volleys of sound so vividly three-dimensional that you sometimes had to resist the impulse to duck.On paper, the program he presented at Avery Fisher Hall promised no great discoveries: selections from Shostakovich’s frothy Suite for Variety Orchestra, Rachmaninoff’s chocolate-box Symphony No. 2 and Bernstein’s bookish “Serenade.” But with the Dutch violinist Liza Ferschtman bringing refined beauty and character to the solo part of the Bernstein, and with the orchestra’s architectural power magnifying the humanity of Rachmaninoff’s Romanticism, the concert was nothing short of revelatory.In part, the orchestra draws its generous, zaftig sound from the basses. Where other ensembles relegate them to the side of the stage, Mr. Fischer places them on a raised platform at the rear of the orchestra, where they offer a big-brother embrace to the rest of the players.The sound is also a result of the glossy brilliance of a first-rate violin section, the patrician authority of the brasses and the stubbornly individualistic colors of many woodwind soloists, including a memorably soulful English horn solo by Clément Noël. But ultimately it is the work of Mr. Fischer, who founded the orchestra in 1983 and now enjoys a symbiotic relationship with its players.This was evident from the first downbeat of Shostakovich’s “March,” which Mr. Fischer gave the instant he walked through the stage door, smiling at the audience members who scrambled to put away their programs as he briskly strode to the podium and — even more startling — encouraged them to clap along to the mock-martial music.Ms. Ferschtman brought laserlike purity and intensity to Bernstein’s “Serenade,” which was conceived as a five-part Platonic dialogue in praise of love. Her sound was melting and lustrous in the long phrases of the first movement, “Phaedrus,” and alluringly veiled in “Aristophanes.” In the fast spiccato passages of “Erixymachus” it showed satisfying bite.Mr. Fischer began Rachmaninoff’s symphony with a scooping arm movement that brought forth the first brooding theme in the basses. In the hour that followed (the work was presented in its full, uncut form), Mr. Fischer repeatedly showed off his glassblower’s sense of heat and timing, an intuitive understanding of when to mold a phrase with a few swift gestures and when to hold back and allow it to settle.In a work that is so unabashedly Romantic, Mr. Fischer negotiated the fine line between overindulging in its emotions and prudish self-censorship. He allowed the yearning first theme of the slow movement to express itself fully but answered it with a clarinet solo of aristocratic restraint and worshipful simplicity. The many big portamentos in the strings, where one note slides into the other, were each given a character: wistful, hesitant or melancholic.As an encore, the orchestra presented Leroy Anderson’s “Blue Tango,” ending the concert with a medicinal dose of humor and swagger."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/arts/music/joseph-eger-french-horn-player-and-conductor-dies-at-92.html,"Joseph Eger, a French horn player, conductor and advocate for progressive causes whose work sought to promote harmony in both senses of the word, died on Jan. 13 at his home in Durham, N.C. He was 92.His wife, Dorita Beh-Eger, confirmed the death.A distinguished horn soloist in the mid-20th century, Mr. Eger later turned to conducting; in the 1960s he served under Leopold Stokowski as an associate conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra.In the 1960s and ’70s Mr. Eger founded several groups designed to conscript music and the other arts in the service of social change. The best known of these, Symphony for United Nations, a nongovernmental organization associated with the United Nations, was established in New York in 1974.Comprising a fluid, ever-changing roster of professional musicians and other performers, the group has put on concerts throughout the world, including benefit performances for victims of the Chernobyl disaster and Bosnian refuges.It gave its last performance, in San Francisco, with Mr. Eger conducting Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony, in 2010. Ms. Beh-Eger said she hoped to revive the group under a new conductor.Joseph Eger was born on July 9, 1920, in South Manchester, Conn., and reared in and around Pittsburgh. After studies at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, he played in orchestras throughout the United States.By the 1950s he had embarked on a solo career, something that few players of the French horn, with its temperamental constitution and limited solo repertory, have been able to do.“When you ask a hornist to name a famous hornist from that time, the name everyone would give was Dennis Brain,” said Kate Pritchett, an assistant professor of French horn at Oklahoma City University, invoking the celebrated English player, who died in 1957. “And Joseph Eger was very much the American equivalent.” (Ms. Pritchett wrote a doctoral dissertation on Mr. Eger’s work.)As a soloist, Mr. Eger appeared on some of New York’s principal concert stages, including Carnegie Hall. Reviewing his performance of Mozart’s Third Horn Concerto at Town Hall in 1956, The New York Times wrote that “his playing of the difficult cadenza in the first movement elicited from yesterday’s audience a subdued gasp of admiration.”In the early 1960s, the slip of a tool while Mr. Eger was in the dentist’s chair gave him a lip injury that ended his playing career. He switched to conducting, studying under Pierre Monteux.In the ’60s and afterward, Mr. Eger founded a series of professional and semiprofessional ensembles in Manhattan, among them the West Side Symphony and the New York Orchestral Society, that gave free concerts in city parks, housing projects and other public spaces.By the end of the decade he had begun presenting concerts that fused classical music with rock and featured psychedelic spectacles by Joshua Light Show.In the early ’70s Mr. Eger founded Aware, New York, a group intended to promote social harmony in the city through live multimedia performances. The next year he founded the Yoga Symphony, which sought to infuse Eastern music and spiritual practice into Western concert halls.Mr. Eger’s first marriage, to Dixie Blackstone, ended in divorce. Ms. Beh-Eger, whom he married in 1990, is his only immediate survivor.Among his recordings is a critically praised 1957 album, “Around the Horn” (RCA Victor), which includes solo pieces and a lecture by Mr. Eger about the French horn.He was the author of a book, “Einstein’s Violin: A Conductor’s Notes on Music, Physics, and Social Change,” published in 2005.Mr. Eger’s musical philosophy was perhaps best expressed by a concert he conducted at Alice Tully Hall in 1972. The program included “Wind Piece,” a composition by John Lennon and Yoko Ono that called for huge electric fans to be stationed in the orchestra, blowing the pages of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony at random on players’ music stands.The players played whatever page was open at any given moment. The result, as The Times described it, was “chaos.”But that, Mr. Eger said, was precisely the point. “You can drop bombs on people,” he told The Times afterward, “and blow their pages apart, so to speak, but the people will remain. London didn’t fall apart during the blitz, and New York won’t fall apart now.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/opinion/invitation-to-a-dialogue-media-violence.html,"To the Editor:The National Rifle Association’s cynical exploitation of concerns about media violence to obfuscate the need for gun control trivializes a very real public health issue. Recent articles in The Times (“The Real World Forces Its Way Into the Gamers’ Universe,” Dec. 26; “Real and Virtual Firearms Nurture a Marketing Link,” Dec. 25) and elsewhere dismiss links between violent media and real-life violence, but the truth is far more complex.Research repeatedly demonstrates that, for children, exposure to violent video games, movies and television programs is a risk factor for becoming desensitized to violence, lack of sympathy for victims and aggressive behavior. Proponents for allowing purveyors of violent media unfettered access to children dismiss the research because it is correlational and not causal.But public health policy is often based on correlation between behavior and harm, and the correlation between media violence and aggression is almost as strong as the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer — and stronger than other acknowledged public health threats such as the links between not using a condom and sexually transmitted H.I.V., and early exposure to lead and lower I.Q. scores.Regardless of the role violent media played or didn’t play in the tragic Newtown shootings, children are harmed by frequent exposure to movies, video games, music and TV programs that glorify violence. We shouldn’t let the National Rifle Association’s smoke and mirrors, or the urgent need for gun control and effective, readily available mental health services, distract from the problem of media violence.We need to stop allowing children to be targets for marketing violent media, and to help parents understand its potential dangers and set limits on its consumption.SUSAN LINNBoston, Jan. 21, 2013The writer is director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and author of “Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood.”Editors’ Note: We invite readers to respond by Thursday for the Sunday Dialogue.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/arts/music/philharmonic-announces-ny-phil-biennial-for-2014.html,"Canals don’t run by Lincoln Center, and you would be hard-pressed to find a beach near Broadway, but the New York Philharmonic has notions to do for classical music what the Venice Biennale and Art Basel Miami Beach have done for art.The orchestra is calling it the NY Phil Biennial.Disclosed on Wednesday as part of the orchestra’s announcement of its 2013-14 programming, the biennial will be a 10-day festival (every two years, as the name implies) that Philharmonic officials describe as a “veritable playground of new and recent music from around the world.”The project extends efforts by the orchestra, which has sought in recent years to fend off critical perceptions that it is stodgy, to program more contemporary music and seize some sort of initiative in the search for more relevance and newer audiences. Under its music director, Alan Gilbert, the Philharmonic has already established a modest new-music series in smaller concert halls and has installed composers and artists in residence.The 2014 festival will run from May 29 to June 7 and include two programs by the orchestra, several programs of chamber music by Philharmonic musicians and performances by the Orchestra of St. Luke’s and Juilliard School musicians. The organizers hope to add symposiums and other public events.The Philharmonic said it had reached agreements with several New York institutions to collaborate on paying for, planning or serving as host for the concerts, including the 92nd Street Y, Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Juilliard and the Special Music School at the Kaufman Center.While plans remain vague, as many as three events a day could be on the agenda, Mr. Gilbert said in an interview.Orchestra officials acknowledged that the NY Phil Biennial may not attract the tens of thousands of visitors who pour into the art fairs in both Basel and Miami Beach or produce the vast display of culture in the pavilions of Venice.“It’s obviously not going to be exhaustive,” Mr. Gilbert said. “It’s obviously not going to go over every point of view.” But for a “contained period of time,” he added, audience members can “get a glimpse of what we feel has been exciting in the recent past.”While the financial details of the festival remained murky, it appears the orchestra is putting significant resources toward it. Matthew VanBesien, the executive director, said that the Philharmonic was making a “major investment” in the festival and that a single donor had provided a gift in the “$2 million to $3 million” range over three years.David Snead, the vice president for marketing, said the orchestra would make a big advertising and social media push, “to create a brand, a personality,” for the biennial.The festival’s artistic goal is to present works that have never been performed, or at least never in New York (which for some people amounts to the same thing).“We want it to be a reaction to, and a reflection of, exciting composition that is happening around the world,” Mr. Gilbert said. The orchestra chose the word “biennial,” he said, to imply that the festival was permanent and to convey the feel of a broad international survey. “We want to provide for music a nexus and rallying point that the great biennials in the art world have become,” Mr. Gilbert said.Details are scarce because programmers want to have the flexibility of making last-minute decisions, Mr. Gilbert added, although they may have been too busy planning the orchestra’s season, which opens on Sept. 25 with a gala concert featuring Osvaldo Golijov’s “Azul” for cello and orchestra and an arrangement of Astor Piazzolla’s “Serie del Ángel,” with Yo-Yo Ma as soloist.Other highlights of the season include performances of all five Beethoven piano concertos, with Yefim Bronfman as soloist; a number of works by Christopher Rouse, the Philharmonic’s composer in residence; performances featuring Glenn Dicterow, the concertmaster, who will be in his last season; an Asian tour; a program of music and clips from Pixar movies; and a showing of Stanley Kubrick’s “2001: A Space Odyssey” with the orchestra playing the film score live.The “2001” performance will be a rare case in which the Philharmonic’s lack of playing is being cast as a virtue. Silence is a key part of the movie, so the orchestra will stay onstage the whole time, the Philharmonic said, “highlighting Kubrick’s strategic and eloquent use of both music and silence in storytelling.”Alec Baldwin, the actor and a Philharmonic board member and booster, attended a news conference to announce the season. He called the pairing of the Philharmonic and Kubrick a “dream come true,” and added, “I promise no lip-syncing,” drawing laughter with the reference to recorded soundtracks at President Obama’s inauguration.The orchestra will dedicate two of its subscription concerts to the biennial, said Ed Yim, the vice president for artistic planning. The first will be a collaboration with the Juilliard Orchestra, works to be determined. The second will be the first performances of Mr. Rouse’s Symphony No. 4, a Philharmonic commission.The orchestra is expanding its new-music series, Contact!, to include three concerts at the 92nd Street Y’s TriBeCa performance space, Mr. Yim said. One of those TriBeCa concerts will be included under the biennial umbrella.With the prospect of so many performances of new works, Mr. Gilbert said, “composers and publishers around the world are jumping up and down.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/fashion/makeup-artists-and-hairstylists-face-shrinking-job-market.html,"LOS ANGELES — The shrimp was piled high. Corks from bottles of pink Champagne were popping. And the setting — the Hollywood Museum in the original Max Factor studio off Hollywood Boulevard — gave the night an air of mildewy glamour.But many of the hundreds of men and women who gathered on a night last November to celebrate the 75th anniversary of the makeup artists’ and hairstylists’ guild (a k a Local 706) were feeling less than bubbly as they milled around photographs of Marilyn Monroe before she was blond, and gowns from “The Good Wife.”“A lot of people here are out of work,” said Jeffrey Fetzer, a hair and makeup artist, nibbling on a chocolate truffle dessert.Robert Constant, another makeup artist, who was wearing owl-shaped glasses and a paisley print shirt, said: “This isn’t the job your mother wants for you, O.K.? It’s a roller coaster.”Now, in the thick of red-carpet season, much attention is paid to the supposedly alluring business of grooming stars on-screen and off. And indeed there was a time when sculpturing a star’s hair into the perfect beach wave or contouring winglike cheekbones was a prized job. There was the proximity to A-list actors and actresses; the adrenaline-fueled commotion of a movie set or television show; and decent paychecks.But many members of Local 706, who work on most of the major feature films, TV shows and theater productions here, find that it’s a struggle to get by. Movies and television have been fleeing to tax-break locales like Georgia, North Carolina and Louisiana; of the 23 new one-hour network dramas for the fall and midseason, only two were filmed in Los Angeles, an 80 percent drop from 2005.Hourly rates have also taken a beating and can dip into the teens on low-budget productions, said Tommy Cole, a business representative for Local 706. As a result, many members “work more for benefits than for wages,” he said, and stylists are having to reinvent themselves as “Johnny and Janes of all trades.”“I recommend to some of our artists, please, find something that you can work on the side,” Mr. Cole said. “Have something to fall back on.”Union members are heeding the advice.“Yes, absolutely, oh my gosh,” said Melanie Mills, a makeup artist who won an Emmy for her work on “Dancing With the Stars,” when asked if she did anything on the side. “I run fashion shows, I’ll do a wedding — anything,” Ms. Mills continued as she hugged a colleague and fellow Emmy winner, Nadege Schoenfeld. “We just did a show called ‘The Taste’ with Anthony Bourdain. We love Anthony!”“So sexy!” cooed Ms. Schoenfeld.(The women were less enthusiastic about Nigella Lawson, who is also on the cooking competition show that began its run on Tuesday, because, they said, Ms. Lawson brought her own makeup artist from London.)But Ms. Mills’s main extracurricular project is her makeup line, Gleam by Melanie Mills, which she said she operated “out of my garage.”“A lot of people create product lines on the side, trying to become a Bobbi Brown or a Laura Mercier,” she said.Kelly O’Leary, a 37-year-old makeup artist who has worked on “True Blood,” said she also modeled and did stunt work.“You can’t make enough, no,” solely as a makeup artist, she said. “I’ve even considered finishing my biology degree and pursuing something more stable.”Things were not always this grim, said Mr. Cole, a former child actor and Mickey Mouse Club Mouseketeer who started as a makeup artist in 1965.“I’d get on a job for a week, two weeks, I’d get three jobs offered while I was on the job,” he said. “And I’d give them to my friends or compadres who I knew would do a good job.”He rattled off some of the famous faces he has powdered and plucked over the years: Cher (“Never a bad word; she worked with me”); Raquel Welch (“A beautiful lady”); and Barbara Walters (“I did her for four years. I traveled with her back in New York”).Granted, there is still good money in primping celebrities for premieres and awards shows; for this, makeup artists and hairstylists do not need to be part of the union. And certain stars retain “personals” for rather comfortable salaries.But even then, there is no such thing as job security. Scott Barnes, who was Jennifer Lopez’s makeup artist for nearly a decade, has publicly discussed being fired when he was suspected of leaking gossip about the star. (He and Ms. Lopez have since reconciled.)Mr. Constant stressed the importance of a good reputation.“Are you honest?” he asked. “Are you reliable? Do you not make trouble in the trailer? Are you not telling stories? If you’re reliable and you’re good to be with, people are going to want to rehire you.”And if you know your place.“They’re not your friend,” Mr. Constant said, lowering his voice, of celebrities.Sheryl Blum, a hairstylist, had this advice: “You don’t want to come across as too gregarious. It’s not about us, it’s about them. It’s about the artist that’s sitting in your chair.”Ms. Blum, an industry veteran whose credits include “The Hunger Games,” said that she had no complaints when it came to finding work. “I’ve done O.K.”Michele Payne, a fellow hairstylist standing nearby, noted: “That’s because we work in groups, which helps. Like cliques.”Ms. Blum and Ms. Payne had just finished doing the hair for background performers on “Star Trek Into Darkness,” which comes out this year. (Most of the main stars “had their own people,” Ms. Blum said.)“We invented hairstyles,” Ms. Payne said proudly.They joked about one: “a braid that comes right out of the top of the actress’s head,” Ms. Blum said. “We did it with chopsticks.”Ms. Payne mock-punched her friend on the arm. “You’re giving away our secrets!” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/fashion/eddie-huang-defies-description.html,"The firebrand chef Eddie Huang took over a table at Hot Kitchen, a Sichuan restaurant in the East Village, and commandeered the remote control. It was a Saturday night, and the Orlando Magic was losing to the New York Knicks. As Carmelo Anthony worked his way to 40 points, Mr. Huang’s body jerked in sympathetic rebound.Mr. Huang’s face was framed by a crisp black New Yorker baseball cap. On his pinkie was a ring emblazoned with a Star of David; on his wrist a Nike+ FuelBand; and on his torso was an oversized black hoodie with the letters “P-I-F” emblazoned on the front.“It’s a type of very high-quality weed,” Mr. Huang said matter-of-factly. “The proper usage is, ‘You got dat pif, mang?’ ”  Mr. Huang smiled, a walking mixtape of postmodern cultural appropriation.At 30, Mr. Huang is usually identified as a chef, which is only partly true. He is the chef and co-owner of BaoHaus, an informal Taiwanese bun shop in the East Village. But, he is quick to add, “I have more to say as a writer than from behind a wok.”Since 2009, Mr. Huang has built a career as an author and a television personality based on his brash cultural mashups and his take-no-prisoners critiques of everyone and everything.He has berated fellow chefs like Marcus Samuelsson and David Chang as exploiters and sellouts. On his online recaps, he has attacked the HBO show “Girls” as elitist. He has excoriated Guy Fieri as a cruel joke, and he pontificates on divisive topics like interracial dating and shark fin soup.He disseminates these broadsides on his blog, Fresh Off The Boat; through his active Twitter account, @MrEddieHuang; on a popular Vice online series called Fresh Off The Boat; and in a memoir of the same name, published this month by Random House.Mr. Huang’s path has been nomadic and unsteady. Raised in Orlando, Fla., he moved to New York in 2005 to study at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University. “Yo, I was the president of the Minority Law Students Alliance,” he said. “It was ill.”After graduating, he practiced corporate law at Chadbourne & Parke but was laid off in March 2009.  Rather than continue law, he found work as a stand-up comic at the Laugh Lounge on the Lower East Side. Using the stage name Magic Dong Huang, he was a loud and high-energy figure, telling jokes about soy milk, Osama bin Laden and growing up Chinese in Orlando.“My only goal as a comedian was to stomp the life out of the model-minority myth,” he writes in the memoir. To make ends meet, he said, he also ran a loose network of marijuana dealers. “I had other comics selling my weed,” he said.Seeking greater exposure, Mr. Huang appeared on the Food Network show “Ultimate Recipe Showdown,” hosted by Mr. Fieri. Although he did not win, the show gave him the confidence to open BaoHaus with his brother, Evan, just nine months after being laid off.Crammed into a basement space on Rivington Street, it served savory bite-sized buns for a few dollars and “was meant to be like a futuristic Y.M.C.A., where all the weirdos could hang out,” he said.Six months later, he opened a full-service restaurant, Xiao Ye, which served dishes like Cheeto-Fried Chicken and ran specials like Four Loko Thursdays, based on the banned energy drink. The critics were brutal. “Xiao Ye is a bummer,” wrote Sam Sifton in a blistering review in The New York Times, rating it “fair.”“The review was a wake-up call,” Mr. Huang said. “I realized I couldn’t play hard and work hard. So I decided to dedicate myself, but not in the way people expected. I realized it is time to do what I came here for, to speak my mind and to talk about all the things about America I’d like to change.”Eventually Xiao Ye closed, and Mr. Huang, with extra time on his hands, began to speak out. He criticized Mr. Samuelsson for exploiting the African-American experience at the Red Rooster in an article he wrote for The New York Observer. He criticized Mr. Chang for debasing his food for the Western palate, and took on Western chefs for cooking ethnic food.Mr. Huang went fishing with Tom Colicchio and banged around Brooklyn with Anthony Bourdain. He ignited Twitter wars with Food Network stars like Anne Burrell, calling her “fish filet.” He is giving a TED Talk this year on the shifting waltz between authenticity and ethnicity.“I want to prove you don’t need to have academic syntax to be intelligent,” he said.Mr. Huang’s appeal is not only in what he says, but how he says it — a profane concatenation of Mandarin and African-American vernacular English, spiced with allusions to Jonathan Swift, Charles Barkley and Cam’ron.Although he grew up in suburban Orlando, Mr. Huang was nevertheless deeply influenced by hip-hop culture, and his lexicon is the stuff of Tipper Gore’s nightmares. In a recent Vice episode, Mr. Huang introduced himself by saying: “What up? It’s your boy Eddie Huang. Writer. Chef. Human panda. BangBros connoisseur, and I’m horny for more.” Then he asks a passer-by for a marijuana cigarette.Mr. Huang’s memoir reads like a Taiwanese-American hip-hop version of “Journey to the End of the Night” — an anarchic catalog of small triumphs and horrific scenes of physical abuse. According to the memoir, the abuse came at the hands of Mr. Huang’s father, a former Taiwanese gang-leader-cum-Orlando restaurateur, and his mother, a high-strung housewife.That led, in part, to Mr. Huang’s identification with black culture. “I remember black parents would hit their kids at the grocery store when they bruised the fruit,” he said. “I remember getting hit by my mother when I bruised the fruit, too. I thought, ‘I guess I’m more like them than the white kids.’ ”Today, Mr. Huang lives in a small apartment in Stuyvesant Town with his brother and 120 pairs of sneakers. There are hundred of N.B.A. video games on a shelf and two unopened bottle of Hennessy V.S.O.P. on the table. “I always have two bottles of Hennessy in case something happens,” Mr. Huang said cryptically.The kitchen has fallen into disrepair, but Mr. Huang is rarely home anyway. When he is not traveling for Vice, he is behind the counter at BaoHaus, now on East 14th Street.He was there on a recent afternoon, in an apron and gray sweatshirt, as the hip-hop song “Ambition” by Wale blasted overhead. Mr. Huang’s face was obscured by thick clouds of steam, but his voice could be heard.“Easy to dream but harder to live it,” he sang along to the music. “They’re going to love me for my ambition.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/basketball/brook-lopez-leads-nets-past-timberwolves.html,"MINNEAPOLIS — Coaches had to file their ballots for N.B.A. All-Star reserves Wednesday morning, so nothing Brook Lopez did against the Minnesota Timberwolves on Wednesday night could sway opinions. Not that Lopez will be sweating Thursday’s televised announcement, which comes on an off day in Memphis.“You know I never watch any of that stuff,” he said. “I’ll probably be sitting in my room with the lights turned off, doing nothing.” Told that that sounded depressing, Lopez said with a laugh, “It’s my life.”On a night when the Nets had a much tougher time than they should have against the undermanned Timberwolves, Lopez again made a case for All-Star inclusion. He scored 22 points in a 91-83 victory, the 12th by the Nets in Coach P. J. Carlesimo’s 14 games since replacing Avery Johnson. It is the second-best start by a coach in franchise history, trailing Lawrence Frank’s 13-0 debut in 2003-4.As with Monday’s 88-85 victory over the Knicks at Madison Square Garden, the Nets had stretches of carelessness that almost let Minnesota, even with three starters and three reserves out with injuries, steal a victory.A big fourth quarter from guard C. J. Watson, who scored the first 9 Nets points while Deron Williams sat with four fouls, helped put the Nets (26-16) 10 games over .500 for the first time since the 2005-6 season, when Lopez was a senior in high school in Fresno, Calif.“We rebounded, which was really important,” Carlesimo said. “We’re grateful for the win, but we need to play a little more consistently than we did tonight.”The last time the teams played, Nov. 5 at Barclays Center, the Timberwolves came from 22 points down in the third quarter to win, 107-96. But that was when Johnson coached the Nets, and most of Minnesota’s regulars were healthy. Four Wolves who combined for 53 points that night — Nikola Pekovic (21), Chase Budinger (16), Alexey Shved (10) and Brandon Roy (6) — sat out Wednesday night with injuries.Kevin Love (broken bone in his right hand) was not available then or Wednesday. And Timberwolves Coach Rick Adelman, whose wife has been hospitalized with an undisclosed illness, missed his ninth consecutive game. The assistant Terry Porter filled in.Sloppiness cost the Nets the chance to blow out the Timberwolves early after jumping to 9-0 and 14-2 leads. Lopez hit his first four shots in a 10-point quarter, and Joe Johnson sank 4 of 6 for 8 points. Minnesota scored 12 points on seven first-half Nets turnovers, and the Nets led by only 53-42 at the half, which disappointed Carlesimo.“The turnovers kept them in the game,” he said. “We really could have stretched them out, and we didn’t do it.”The Timberwolves never led but came as close as 2 points two times early in the fourth quarter. Watson held them off — Minnesota’s J. J. Barea committed five fouls in less than five minutes trying to guard him — until Williams returned with 5 minutes 46 seconds to play.“I think he frustrated J. J. a little bit,” Lopez said.Williams hit two foul shots and a 3-pointer around a layup by Lopez to push the Nets ahead, 89-79, with 1:15 to play. Williams and Johnson each had 18 points for the Nets, while Watson finished with 14.“We definitely could have played better, especially defensively,” Williams said. “This team, on offense they move a lot, a lot of back cutting, and we got burned a lot. That was the reason they were hanging around. But we’re happy we’re 2-0 on this road trip.”Lopez added seven rebounds a day after rumors linked him again in a trade for Dwight Howard of the Lakers. This has been going on for two years, and Lopez said he was long past letting such talk concern him.“I was at that point a long time ago,” he said. “I don’t pay any attention to what the media says. I just go about my business and focus on what’s important here.”Memphis, where the Nets play Friday night, is the first stop on a tough stretch that will test whether the Nets are as good as they have played lately. This four-game road trip finishes in Houston on Saturday. Home games with the Orlando, Miami and Chicago follow in a five-day stretch beginning next Wednesday.“It will tell us a lot, for sure, but I don’t think it’s make or break,” Carlesimo said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/ncaafootball/manti-teo-stands-by-his-story-in-a-tv-interview-with-katie-couric.html,"Notre Dame linebacker Manti Te’o admitted to Katie Couric that he answered questions about his “dead” online girlfriend even after he received a call on Dec. 6 from a woman posing as the fake person.Te’o also maintained he played no part in the hoax.Pressed by Couric to admit that he was in on the deception, Te’o said he was convinced the woman he knew as Lennay Kekua died in September. Te’o claims he never met Kekua in person but developed a relationship with her through phone calls and electronic messages.“Katie, put yourself in my situation,” Te’o said in an interview to air Thursday on Couric’s syndicated talk show. “I, my whole world told me that she died on Sept. 12. Everybody knew that. This girl, who I committed myself to, died on Sept. 12.”“Now I get a phone call on Dec. 6, saying that she’s alive and then I’m going be put on national TV two days later” Te’o said. “And to ask me about the same question. You know, what would you do?”A segment of the interview with Te’o and his parents was broadcast on Wednesday on ABC’s “Good Morning America.”Te’o made at least three references to his girlfriend in news media interviews after Dec. 6.Te’o’s father defended his son when Couric pointed out that many people do not believe him, suspecting he used the situation for personal gain.“People can speculate about what they think he is,” Brian Te’o said with tears in his eyes. “I’ve known him 21 years of his life. And he’s not a liar. He’s a kid.”On Tuesday, the woman whose photo was used on the Twitter account of Te’o’s supposed girlfriend said the man allegedly behind the hoax confessed and apologized to her.The woman, Diane O’Meara, told NBC’s “Today” show that the supposed hoaxer, Ronaiah Tuiasosopo, used pictures of her without her knowledge in creating a fake woman called Lennay Kekua.Te’o told ESPN last week that Tuiasosopo had contacted him to apologize for the hoax soon after Deadpsin.com broke the news with a long report. Te’o told ESPN that not until Tuiasosopo confessed did he finally, fully realize Kekua did not exist.Tuiasosopo has not commented on the scheme.The top F.B.I. agent in northern Indiana said the authorities do not believe a crime was committed, so there is no investigation.“I don’t think there was any financial harm to Mr. Te’o,” said Robert Ramsey, the Federal Bureau of Investigation’s supervisory special agent for northern Indiana. “There was no federal violation regarding the Internet hoax perpetrated against Mr. Te’o.”If there had been a crime, Ramsey said, it would fall under federal jurisdiction."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/movies/the-last-new-wave-70s-australian-film-at-lincoln-center.html,"The Last New Wave, the title of the Film Society of Lincoln Center’s retrospective of the late-1970s resurgence of the Australian movie industry, might not sit well with everyone. What about Romania, you might ask, or Iran or South Korea?But “last” in this case has a particular frame of reference: the time when new waves were all the rage in film, from French to Czech to American. The Australian reawakening came at the end of that stretch, and for a cohort of American filmgoers who are now in their 40s and early 50s it was the first of those national flowerings that could be experienced in real time.So this 19-film series, which begins Friday with two of its strongest entries, Fred Schepisi’s “Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith” (1978) and “Devil’s Playground” (1976), will be strongly nostalgic for some of us, summoning a time when films like Gillian Armstrong’s “My Brilliant Career,” Peter Weir’s “Picnic at Hanging Rock” and Bruce Beresford’s “Getting of Wisdom” dominated art-house screens and dorm-room conversations.It’s also a chance to catch up. About half the selections are less familiar ones that most Americans probably missed at the time, from Philip Noyce’s debut feature, the rough-and-tumble “Backroads” (1977), to Ken Hannam’s sheep-station epic, “Sunday Too Far Away” (1975), some of which are unavailable online (by legal means) or as American-formatted DVDs.The Australian revival, beginning in the early ’70s with films like Nicolas Roeg’s “Walkabout” (not in the festival) and Tim Burstall’s raunchy comedy “Alvin Purple,” was not driven by ideology, either cinematic or cultural. After a fallow period of several decades when, for economic reasons, the country produced practically no feature films, the Australian government stepped in, subsidizing production and establishing a national film school whose first class included Mr. Noyce and Ms. Armstrong.Just as important, the pent-up creative energies released by this infusion of public money meshed with a pool of technicians and actors who had considerable experience in Australian television, which had remained surprisingly robust while the country’s film industry went dark.The businesslike beginnings of the boom, which was at its height from the mid-’70s to the early ‘80s, probably help explain the films’ popularity in the United States. What unites them more than anything else is their old-fashioned approach to storytelling, a straight-ahead narrative style that could be quite sophisticated in the hands of directors like Mr. Schepisi or Ms. Armstrong but didn’t stray far from Hollywood norms. (The exception was Mr. Weir, whose more oblique style at the time contributed to the chic menace of “Picnic at Hanging Rock.”)The films also shared a vitality, a love of open spaces and a propensity for sudden violence and languorous sexuality that may have reminded Americans of their own new wave, the Hollywood-maverick period of the late 1960s and early ’70s that had just about run its course. Movies like “Backroads“ and Mr. Burstall’s “Petersen” (1974), combining loose-jointed, turbulent stories, working-class protagonists and an acute consciousness of the politics of class and race, felt like those earlier American independents.The film society’s selections range widely in subject and period, from the Victorian-era stories of female artists like “My Brilliant Career” (from 1979, with its star performance by a young Judy Davis) and “The Getting of Wisdom,” to sprawling midcentury historical dramas like “Sunday Not Too Far Away” and Mr. Noyce’s 1978 “Newsfront,” about newsreel photographers; to jittery contemporary tales of misdirected male energy like “Backroads,” “Petersen” and Michael Thornhill’s “FJ Holden” (1977), an Australian answer to George Lucas’s 1973 “American Graffiti.”But strong themes and motifs run through the series, beginning with the omnipresence of the sweeping Australian landscape as photographed by talented cinematographers like Donald McAlpine and Russell Boyd, who between them shot seven of the films in the series. Few of these films take place in cities; it’s a cinema of countryside and suburb, and whether that was a choice or a response to a lack of studio spaces, the outdoor settings are defining, lush caldrons for tension and violence or drab rural prisons to be escaped.Complementing this is a focus on cars, both as symbols of male pride and prerogative and as crucial possessions in a country where great distances separate small pockets of life. Motorized vehicles are central to “Backroads” (which even has an opening credit for the stolen 1962 Pontiac Parisienne that the two main characters take on a long and violent joy ride), “The FJ Holden” (named after a car) and the most famous, least typical film in the series, George Miller’s postapocalyptic demolition derby “Mad Max” (1979).The most noticeable thread linking the films, though, is their emphasis on questions of class and race, a quality that seems both eager — as if a long-held desire to tackle such issues were finally being satisfied — and matter of fact: What else would an Australian movie in the 1970s be about? Social mobility is the subject of films as disparate as “Petersen,” featuring Jack Thompson’s casually moving performance as a former footballer trying to get his college degree, and “The Getting of Wisdom,” about a precocious country girl sent to a rigidly conformist boarding school in 1890s Melbourne.And the question of the relationship between black and white, indigenous and colonizer, is nearly always present, whether as a background note or a central theme. It’s at the heart of two of the series’s most rewarding films, the minor but inventive “Backroads” and the great, shattering period drama “Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith,” both profoundly pessimistic takes on the possibility of understanding between aborigines and white Australians.That ambivalence — an avoidance of the purely happy ending — is another thing that characterized the Australian new wave, and it gives the series a weight that compensates for some wide variations in quality. (Best bets: the Schepisi films, “Backroads,” “Newsfront” and the chilly “My Brilliant Career” for Ms. Davis’s performance.) Some of those early directors would go on to make even better Australian films — Ms. Armstrong’s “High Tide,” Mr. Noyce’s “Rabbit-Proof Fence” — but the good ones mostly decamped for Hollywood, and the real future of Australian film would arrive in 1986 with the bewildering worldwide popularity of “Crocodile Dundee.” Since then the industry’s main exports have been tinselly comedies (“Muriel’s Wedding,” “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert”) and the bloated fantasies of Baz Luhrmann.“The Last New Wave” captures a moment of freedom and abundance that was over almost before we knew it."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/movies/awardsseason/for-beasts-of-the-southern-wild-accolades-aplenty.html,"PARK CITY, Utah — It was almost exactly one year ago that Quvenzhané Wallis, the star of “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” made her bad little self known to the world. After the premiere of the movie here at the Sundance Film Festival, Ms. Wallis, then 8, took to the stage with her cast mates and film crew. She received a standing ovation. Handed a mike, she introduced herself and announced, “I like to have a party!” Cue the hearts melting of 1,300 audience members.Since then she’s had ample opportunity to celebrate, as “Beasts” has gone from Sundance darling to Oscar contender. It has marquee nominations for best picture, best director, best adapted screenplay and best actress; Ms. Wallis, now 9 (and she made the film three years ago), is the youngest best actress nominee ever.It has not gone to her head. “Hi,” she’ll say, waving at a familiar adult face at a froufrou event in her honor, then retreating to something more kid friendly, like a digital game. Ms. Wallis is in the fourth grade in Houma, La., where she lives with her parents, older brothers and sister, reading and going to their basketball games when she’s not playing the part of a movie star. It’s a part that comes with good accessories, like sparkly new shoes and a puppy-shaped purse that she carries onstage with her when she accepts awards, still reading in the halting voice of a grade schooler, not a professional child actor.The unexpected trajectory of “Beasts” has not changed the rest of the crew much either; they remain steadfastly indie. And the bootstraps story behind the film is as integral to its charm as its magical-realist setting.A debut feature made by Hollywood outsiders, with a cast of mostly nonprofessional actors, it was shepherded through the creative rigors of the Sundance Institute’s labs, where the filmmakers honed the story of a little girl, Hushpuppy, and her dying father, Wink, in a tight-knit bayou community. With a budget of $1.8 million cobbled together from various nonprofits, chiefly Cinereach, a foundation that offers financing for films from “underrepresented perspectives,” and other prizes and film festival grants, it was shot in Louisiana over two months in 2010 and finished just three days before its Sundance premiere.“It was an extremely emotional week,” recalled Dan Janvey, a producer of the film. By that point cast and crew members had been working on the movie for three and a half years, living cheaply in New Orleans to do so; 130 of them turned up for the premiere. “I remember tears of exhaustion during the first few minutes of the film,” Benh Zeitlin, the director and co-writer, said. “After that I remember going straight back into mental notes on sound mixing and color.”“Beasts of the Southern Wild” would not remotely be what it is without Sundance, Mr. Janvey said in an interview here on Tuesday. He is a product of the Sundance producers lab, where he met a trustee who became an adviser and eventually another producer on the movie. Mr. Zeitlin and Lucy Alibar, who adapted it from her one-act play, also attended the writers and directors labs. “Once they take on a film, they will nurture it through its completion,” Mr. Janvey said of the lab programs. “And that’s an unbelievable level of commitment.”It won the grand jury prize for dramatic film at the festival, and the Caméra d’Or at Cannes in May, where Ms. Wallis gleefully went for a few spins on a teacup ride. (During the premiere at Sundance, Mr. Janvey had to shush her because she was giggling so much.) At the loop of awards luncheons and ceremonies she now attends in New York and Los Angeles she is often found dancing in a corner, or playing silly games with Mr. Zeitlin. Her mother, Qulyndreia, a teacher, is her steward on the scene, but Mr. Zeitlin acts as pal and gatekeeper too. The family has no plans to move to Los Angeles, though Ms. Wallis has already wrapped another film, with the director Steve McQueen, with Dwight Henry, who plays her father in “Beasts.”Mr. Henry has not been as present on the awards circuit, in part because he is busy with his day job: running the Buttermilk Drop Bakery and Cafe in New Orleans. After meeting him there, Mr. Zeitlin, Mr. Janvey and other producers persuaded him to take the part of Wink, a hard-drinking toughie who teaches his daughter survival skills as a major storm approaches. That resonated with Mr. Henry, who stayed around New Orleans during Hurricane Katrina.“I can relate to him as far as he loves his community, he loves the people, the land that he lives on,” he said, as he greeted every customer in his bakery. “He’s an original holdout.” (Though he also has no plans to go to Los Angeles — if Hollywood wants him, he said, it can come to him — his success with the film has helped him expand his business. He is working with the restaurateur Richie Notar to open a bakery, to be called Mr. Henry’s, in Harlem this spring, and will serve desserts in the adjacent jazz club that Mr. Notar, a former owner of Nobu, plans for the former Lenox Lounge space.)Mr. Henry, a career baker, said he was inspired to do the movie by the ethos of the filmmakers. “I thought back to the time when I first opened up my business, when nobody believed in me,” he said. “I got turned down by every finance company, every friend, every family member, everybody you can think of turned me down. Nobody believed in me. And for these guys to come from New York, a first-time feature filmmaker, to put their whole budget, their whole film into me and a young 6-year-old girl’s hands, who’s never acted before, to believe in us, that meant a lot to me.”The “Beasts” crew operated a lot on faith in their own ethos, too, equal parts handicrafting and hard work.“What happened with this film is so surreal,” said Mr. Janvey, who has known Mr. Zeitlin since they were undergrads at Wesleyan University, where he produced Mr. Zeitlin’s senior-thesis short film. “When you really look at this movie, it’s an off-kilter film. But it has an emotional clarity that I think people are reacting to.”Aside from Ms. Wallis it is Mr. Zeitlin’s life that had the potential to be shaken up the most in the last year. But he is still planning karaoke outings with friends in lieu of celebrity-filled galas and operating without the help of high-profile agents or managers. He still lives in New Orleans and is working on another movie with Mr. Janvey that he will also write himself. Mr. Janvey said he expects another nonprofessional cast.There are moments, though, when a glimmer of the change peeks through. After Mr. Zeitlin’s surprise Oscar nomination as best director, Steven Spielberg sent over a bottle of Champagne. At a luncheon hosted by the American Film Institute in Los Angeles this month Mr. Zeitlin and other Beasties stood in a circle around Mr. Spielberg as he described to them, in detail, what parts of their movie made him emotional.“I am a pretty composed person,” Mr. Zeitlin said afterward. “But I am freaking out inside.”Because “Beasts of the Southern Wild” was made on its own terms far from the entertainment industry, the notion of being recognized for it by the cinema establishment never even occurred to its makers.“I’m at a level of dream come true, where John Cassavetes returning from the grave and asking me to have a Scotch with him doesn’t seem out of the realm of possibility,” Mr. Zeitlin said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/sports/baseball/dodgers-and-time-warner-cable-near-deal-for-tv-channel.html,"Well before a group led by Guggenheim Partners acquired the Los Angeles Dodgers for $2.15 billion last year from Frank McCourt, the team expected a financial windfall from its cable television rights.Now, that bonanza appears to be near.Time Warner Cable is expected to announce as soon as Thursday a deal with the Dodgers that would include creating a team-owned channel and paying the team a reported $7 billion over 20 to 25 years. Bloomberg first reported news of the pending agreement.The deal also needs a final agreement with Major League Baseball over how much of the money paid to the Dodgers by Time Warner Cable would be subject to local revenue sharing. Officials of the team and M.L.B. are expected to meet on Thursday.Dodgers and Time Warner officials declined to comment.The Dodgers’ deal differs from the one the N.B.A.’s Lakers have with Time Warner Cable, which is also worth billions of dollars over a long-term contract. Time Warner Cable owns the English- and Spanish-language regional sports networks that it created to carry the Lakers.Time Warner Cable plays two roles in the Los Angeles market, as its dominant cable TV operator and as a newly aggressive sports network owner. Even at steep prices, the Dodgers and Lakers deals give Time Warner Cable cost certainty for its cable systems and end the need to negotiate agreements over monthly subscriber fees with Fox. The Lakers were formerly on the Fox Sports West network. The Dodgers will finish their contract with Fox-owned Prime Ticket after the 2013 season.Fox is not expected to use the rights in its Dodgers contract to match the Time Warner Cable offer.In November, News Corporation, Fox’s parent, gained a significant television foothold outside Los Angeles when it acquired 49 percent of the YES Network, the Yankees’ channel, with an option to buy up to 80 percent in three years."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/arts/spare-times-for-children-for-jan-25-31.html,"‘The Paper Bag Players Saddles and Sunshine’Robert Frost knew that good fences don’t always make good neighbors. Sometimes what you really need is a bear.That wisdom emerges from “Move That Fence!,” one of 10 musical skits in “The Paper Bag Players Saddles and Sunshine,” the new children’s show at the Kaye Playhouse. When Amy (Amy Walsh) builds a fence that Laura (Laura Canty-Samuel) considers to be on her property, an argument ensues. The women finally agree that whoever does better in the county pie-eating contest will have final say on the fence. But when a huge, hungry bear competes, everyone’s perspective changes.This vignette has all the Paper Bag Players’ signatures: Everything, from the fence to the enormous bear costume, is creatively designed from brown wrapping paper, grocery sacks and cardboard. (The scenic artists are Jonathan Peck and Courtney Tramposh.) Danger looms, but in such funny packaging — literally — that it doesn’t scare. The scene bursts with physical comedy, as the wild challenger bumps fists, flings pies and gives bear hugs (of course). And while a moral may lurk somewhere, no player would be so unsubtle as to spell it out.The troupe has been combining these elements for 3-to-9-year-olds since 1958. The current members, who also include Kevin Richard Woodall, John Stone and Ted Brackett, the artistic director, write the material; Mr. Stone composes the keyboard music, which he plays onstage. The audience becomes the chorus line, singing a lullaby (“Don’t Wake the Baby”); slapping knees and skipping (“Howdy!”); and dancing a hoedown (“Cowboy K and the Cowgirls”). In “Spin-A-Dance” a lucky child goes onstage to spin a wheel to select one style of music and three moves — from choices like robot, funky chicken and twist — for joyfully choreographed group chaos.Adults will get their own kicks in this 55-minute revue, directed by Mr. Brackett. “Bob the Slob,” about a gargantuan litter bug (left, with Ms. Canty-Samuel), is hilarious no matter what your age. And anyone can appreciate the gentle lyricism of “The Cactus and the Balloon,” in which the title characters confront the seeming impossibility of friendship. But the balloon soon realizes how they can play: a solution so simple, charming and hopeful that it will buoy even cynical grown-ups for the rest of the day.(Saturdays and Sundays at 2 p.m., through Feb. 3, at Hunter College, 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, 212-772-4448; $15 to $30; $100 for premium seats with opening-day cast party; information, 212-353-2332.

LAUREL GRAEBERFor Children‘The Adventures of Maya the Bee’ (Saturday) This feisty puppet heroine has buzzed back to the Culture Project, where her journey began a dozen years ago. Based on a children’s book by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, “The Adventures of Maya the Bee” relates the title character’s flight from the hive in search of tastes more exotic than honey. The revival has new sets and props, but the same intricate rod and shadow puppets designed by Zofia Czechlewska. Adapted by Rachel Klein, with a score and lyrics by the jazz artist Nancy Harrow, who also conceived the show, “Maya” is a jazz musical for children, and how often do you encounter those?

Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume.

This question frequently comes to mind when viewing the complex animation in some of today’s films, and now the Museum of the Moving Image offers visitors an answer for one of those movies: “Rise of the Guardians,” a recent DreamWorks release. This new exhibition consists of more than 25 original drawings and sketches, along with design materials, production artifacts and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film, an adventure about immortal heroes like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. (Through March 3.) The show is accompanied by a retrospective weekend screening series of DreamWorks films. This weekend the film at 1 p.m. is the animated “Bee Movie,” with the voice of Jerry Seinfeld portraying Barry, a bee who takes humans to court over their theft of honey. Another special screening also takes place this weekend, unrelated to the exhibition: On Saturday at 3 p.m. the museum will show “The Muppet Movie” (1979), about Kermit the Frog’s journey to Hollywood stardom. Paul Williams, who composed that film’s songs with Kenny Ascher, will attend. Museum hours: 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays; to 8 p.m. on Fridays; 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends; 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us.

But when he’s onstage for that series, he’s almost always someone else as well: in this case Inspector Pulse, the intrepid detective Mr. Adolphe refers to as a “private ear.” In this program the inspector is at first disappointed in his nephew’s gift — a banjo — because he can play only three chords on it. But soon he and young listeners learn that those chords are key to many folk songs, as well as to great works by Beethoven, Brahms, Copland and other composers.

For the Piccolini Trio, the answer is easy: put on the show yourself. These three clowns do so in the revival of this production, which signals the reopening of the Canal Park Playhouse after extensive damage during Hurricane Sandy. Part of the Classic Brunch Matinee Series at the playhouse, it includes acrobatics, juggling, slapstick and music. At 1 and 4 p.m., 508 Canal Street, near Greenwich Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, canalparkplayhouse.com; $20; a pre-fixe brunch from the theater’s Waffle Iron Café before or after the show is also available for $10 or $15, depending on the menu.Disney on Ice: ‘Treasure Trove’ (Friday through Sunday) The treasure in this production is cinematic gold, not the kind beloved by pirates, though you can expect to see them skating around too. Disney decided to mine its entire archive of films for the scenes in this extravaganza, which ends its run in the New York area this weekend. It includes moments from its earliest movie, “Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,” and its most recent, “Tangled.” Young fans, who participate in the action at various points, can also expect characters from pictures including “The Lion King,” “Alice in Wonderland,” “Aladdin,” “Peter Pan” and “The Little Mermaid.” Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 11 a.m. and 3 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at 1 and 5 p.m.; Barclays Center, 620 Atlantic Avenue, at Flatbush Avenue, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, barclayscenter.com; disneyonice.com; $30 to $100.‘Erth’s Dinosaur Zoo’ (Friday through Sunday) It’s certainly friendlier than Jurassic Park. In this interactive show, closing this weekend at the New Victory Theater, Erth, a troupe from Sydney, Australia, takes children on a multimedia tour of prehistory that uses giant, minutely detailed puppets to portray dinosaurs and a few of their forebears. The production provides intriguing information, conveyed by Scott Wright, the company’s artistic director and the enthusiastic M.C. And the puppets are quite convincing: Theatergoers are invited to encounter the creatures close-up after the show, and nothing captivates (or unnerves) quite like a blinking eye. Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 11 a.m. and 3 and 7 p.m.; New Victory Theater, 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org; $14 to $38; $9 to $25 for members.Family Day: Carnival of the Elephants (Saturday) In this program the Bard Graduate Center will celebrate one of the circus’s biggest stars. Aimed at children 6 to 12 and their families, the afternoon will include hearing the animal expert and author Elizabeth Hanson discuss elephants and watching Caroline Borderies perform a shadow puppet play about one that finds work in a New York circus. Young visitors will also be able to make their own shadow puppets and go on tours of the Bard exhibition “Circus in the City: New York, 1793-2010,” which runs through Feb. 3.

This week’s title is a 1954 science-fiction classic: “Creature From the Black Lagoon,” shown here in 3-D. If you remember this guy with the gills, you know he can be scary, so parents are advised not to take children younger than 10. The movie will be screened with a short, James Thurber’s “Unicorn in the Garden.” At 11 a.m., 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $7.‘Flight of the Butterflies’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to think of the graceful creatures that are the subject of this fascinating film as traveling only short distances, flitting from flower to flower. But half a billion monarch butterflies actually migrate 3,000 miles every fall, to Mexico from Canada. A new Imax movie, this project chronicles their journey and the 40-year investigation of it by one impassioned scientist, Fred A. Urquhart. (Through July 7.) Hourly, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5200, amnh.org.

The stars are the members of the Yang family: Fan and Ana Yang and their son Deni and others, who rotate as M.C.’s for the production. Audience members may even find themselves in bubbles of their own. (The run is open-ended.) Fridays at 7 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m. and 2 and 4:30 p.m.; Sundays at noon and 3 p.m.; New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, gazillionbubbleshow.com; $44.50 to $99.50; lap seats for ages 2 and under are $20, at the box office only.‘Hollow’ (Saturday) Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman are off and riding again in this new musical from Be Bold!

At 5:30 p.m., Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, at Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, hollowthemusical.com; $35 to $50.Illuminated: A Winter Festival (Saturday and Sunday) Winter days are dark in Scandinavia, but that doesn’t bother the Swedes: they create their own light with bright seasonal traditions. Now the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is following suit with its new Illuminated festival, part of its Light in Winter event series. Taking place over two weekends, the festival will offer different themes each day. This Saturday is Illumination Celebration, with art activities, a family lantern-making workshop and a moonlight lantern walk through the garden — featuring giant puppets and stilt dancers — followed by an all-ages afterparty. Sunday’s focus is Do It Yourself, including a pop-up clubhouse for ages 9 to 15. Activities will include acrobatic workshops with LAVA Studio, crafts and a late-afternoon flashlight tour of nature.

Free with garden admission: $10; $5 for students and 65+; free for under 12 and members.Jazz for Kids (Sunday) Every Sunday during most of the school year the Jazz Standard presents not just jazz for kids, but also jazz by kids: the featured players at its Sunday brunches are the members of the Jazz Standard Youth Orchestra, a group of talented young people ages 11 to 18. In this series, which is celebrating its 10th year, the musicians play new arrangements of big-band classics while listeners enjoy barbecue offerings that include a children’s menu. (Through May 13.) Doors open at 1 p.m.; shows are from 1:30 to 3 p.m.; 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net/mobi/kids. Free; in lieu of a cover charge, guests make a $5 donation, which benefits the Jazz Standard Discovery Program, an initiative that brings musical performances to city schools.Kidrockers (Sunday) It’s hard to imagine mature, self-respecting, childless adults wanting — much less needing — to sneak into a kids’ show. But consider that the groups playing at the concerts Beth Lorge produces (for ages 3 to 13) are hot or up-and-coming rock and pop bands, and you can understand why she’s seen it happen. On Sunday she’s presenting the group Caveman, which, despite the name, is very 21st-century New York. Its song “My Time” is even featured in the “I Love New York” advertising campaign. Also appearing is Har Mar Superstar, the R&B crooner otherwise known as Sean Tillmann. At 11:30 a.m. (doors open at 11), Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, between North 11th and 12th Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 963-3369, kidrockers.com; $8; $20 for a family four-pack, available by advance purchase only.Kids ‘N Comedy: ‘The Ugly Sweater Show’ (Sunday) The class clown gets applause, not detention, at this series, in which tween and teenage comics perform stand-up. At this show the young performers will celebrate a postholiday tradition: the wearing of ugly sweaters, whether it’s one your grandmother knitted for you or something your brother bought as a joke. The material is recommended for children 9 and older, but there’s no need to worry about appropriateness (profanity is banned) or knock-knock jokes (these dudes are sophisticated). Reservations required. At 1 p.m., Gotham Comedy Club, 208 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 877-6115, kidsncomedy.com; $15, with a one-item (soda or food) minimum.‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’ (Saturday) If the children of the Pevensie family could travel to the magical land of Narnia through something as simple as a wardrobe, why shouldn’t two hard-working actors be able to play them and all the characters found there? That’s what Catherine Fowles and Jara Jones are attempting in Off Broadway Family Theater’s first production, le Clanché du Rand’s adaptation of C. S. Lewis’s classic novel. (The run is open-ended.) At 11 a.m., St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, narniaoffbroadway.com; $35.‘The Little Moon Theater’ (Saturday and Sunday) The troupe of the title provides more than entertainment: its productions also grant wishes, solving problems or healing hearts with a carefully chosen play. Now Tada! Youth Theater will take over those roles in this revival of “The Little Moon Theater,” a musical based on the children’s book by Irene Haas. With a book by Michael Slade and music and lyrics by Joel Gelpe, the show also focuses on someone who has trouble granting wishes: Penelope, a bumbling fairy godmother who needs some extra help.

Theater, 15 West 28th Street, Manhattan, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 128, tadatheater.com; $15; $8 for 16 and under; $25 and $15 for premium seats.‘The Little Prince’ (Sunday) Long before E.T., another extraterrestrial won the hearts of children: the title character of Antoine de Saint-Exupéry’s fable “The Little Prince,” who lived on a distant planet with only a rose for company. The Target Storybook Series at Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts is presenting Rick Cummins and John Scoullar’s adaptation of the book, recommended for ages 8 and older. This multimedia production incorporates video projections, original songs and large, bunraku-style puppets designed by Michael Schupbach, who also created puppets for “Sesame Street.” At 2 p.m., Brooklyn Center for the Performing Arts, Brooklyn College, Flatbush and Nostrand Avenues, Flatbush, Brooklyn, (718) 951-4500, brooklyncenter.com; $7.Mil’s Trills Winter Bash: ‘Everyone Together Now!’ (Sunday) Not many ensembles are built around an electric ukulele, but that instrument is the specialty of Amelia Robinson, founder of the children’s music series Mil’s Trills. At this annual celebration she invites a host of musical guests. Audience members get involved, too: families are encouraged to bring drums, shakers and all kinds of instruments for jamming and dancing. At 3:30 p.m. (doors open at 3), Littlefield, 622 Degraw Street, between Third and Fourth Avenues, Gowanus, Brooklyn, milstrills.com, littlefieldnyc.com; $12 in advance; $15 at the door; free for under 4.

The interactive show, inspired by the Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” recreates many of the Monkey’s adventures, like fighting the Bull Demon at a station that resembles a video game. Much of the fun teaches Chinese values: cooperation, perseverance, bravery and self-sacrifice. (Through May.) Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays; Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org. Free with admission: $11; $7 for 65+; free for under 1 and members.New York Family Camp Fairs (Saturday and Sunday) Finding the right summer camp can be as complicated a process as finding the right school. New York Family magazine and the American Camp Association try to make the decision easier by holding annual fairs. Many camps, both day and sleep-away, will be represented at these events, offering options for ages 3 to 17. Saturday at St. Jean Baptiste High School, 173 East 75th Street, Manhattan. Sunday at Congregation Rodeph Sholom, 7 West 83rd Street, Manhattan. Fairs run noon to 3 p.m. Registration is recommended at newyorkfamilycamps.com; free.Nitehawk Cinema’s Little Creatures Series (Saturday and Sunday) Eating at a movie usually means popcorn and candy, but Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn provides real meal service at tables in each of its theaters. This month it’s also offering a brunch series for children: Little Creatures. The film this weekend is “The Muppet Movie,” detailing the adventures of Kermit the Frog as he pursues Hollywood stardom. At noon, 36 Metropolitan Avenue, between Berry Street and Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, (718) 384-3980, nitehawkcinema.com; $11; $9 for under 12 and 60+.‘Pippi’ (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Children’s literature had at least one feminist heroine long before the feminist era: Pippi Longstocking, the pint-size, pigtailed, redheaded dynamo who lived independently and fought off villains with the help of pluck and superhuman strength. Now the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater is reviving its 2007 musical based on the Pippi stories by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. With a book by Zakiyyah Alexander and a score by Daryl Kojak, the production features almost two dozen handmade marionettes.

Reservations required; this weekend’s shows are sold out.‘Princess and the Pea’ (Saturday and Sunday) Wouldn’t it be wonderful if all tests for important jobs just involved going to sleep? This is the final weekend that Galli Theater is presenting its adaptation of “The Princess and the Pea,” the story in which the qualifications of a royal young woman can be determined just by her sensitivity to a pea beneath the mattress. On Saturday only, the show is followed by a one-hour theater workshop in which children dress in costume and put together a short play with the help of the theater’s staff. At 2 p.m., Galli Midtown, 347 West 36th Street, Manhattan, (212) 352-3101, gallitheaterny.com; $20; $15 for ages 2 through 17. Workshop is $15; $10 when more than one child from a family attends.‘The Rammellzee Galaxseum’ (Friday through Monday, and Wednesday and Thursday) And just what is a Galaxseum? As envisioned by the artist, hip-hop pioneer and early graffiti writer who called himself Rammellzee, it is a science-fiction fantasy world populated by heroes and monsters whose elaborate costumes and masks Rammellzee often made from found materials. The Children’s Museum of the Arts has recreated the universe of Rammellzee, who died in 2010, in this new exhibition, which includes his performance videos and audio recordings as well as his paintings and objects. Hung from the ceiling are his Letter Racers, letters of the alphabet imagined as military vehicles, ready to rebel from language. Daily art workshops encourage children to explore his ideas.

While Toshi looks for a treasured heirloom, she is visited by her female ancestors, including slaves who stitched the quilts referred to in the title: called “show ways,” they had hidden symbols revealing the routes of the Underground Railroad. With a book by Melody Cooper and music and lyrics by Tyrone L. Robinson, the show is aimed at theatergoers 7 and older. (Through March 3.) At 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., McGinn-Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212) 579-0528, vitaltheatre.org; $25 and $30.Step Into: Tu B’shvat (Sunday) However cold it is outside, all will be warm and blooming in this family program at Hannah Senesh Community Day School, which celebrates Tu B’Shvat, the Jewish holiday known as the New Year of the Trees. Dedicated to children 2 to 5, the event will offer a shadow puppet performance of two stories: “Under the Shade of the Mulberry Tree” and a Tu B’Shvat version of “The Hatseller and the Monkeys.” Other activities will include a Hebrew singalong, leaf-print making and a planting project.

Lent by the New York City Police Museum, temporarily closed because of damage from Hurricane Sandy, the show includes uniforms, paintings, historical photos, film clips, a reproduction of a police stable and a saddle for children to pose in. Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays; Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org. Free with admission: $11; $7 for 65+; free for under 1 and members.‘Theatresports’ (Sunday) It may involve actors, but it’s still a competitive event: The members of Freestyle Repertory Theater, an improv troupe, are once again thinking fast on their feet. They break into two teams and perform skits based on suggestions from the audience. Children will not only vote to determine the winner but also participate onstage. At noon, Gallery Players Theater, 199 14th Street, Park Slope, Brooklyn, (718) 595-0547, Ext. 6, galleryplayers.com; $10 for children; free for adults.‘The Velveteen Rabbit’ (Saturday and Sunday) Bunnies innocent and maybe not so innocent are the subject of the first Rabbit Season at DR2 Kids Theater, which has joined with Theatreworks USA to present two productions: “The Velveteen Rabbit” and “Bunnicula.” This is the final weekend for Kevin Del Aguila’s beautifully realized adaptation of “The Velveteen Rabbit,” Margery Williams’s bittersweet story about a stuffed animal, a small boy and the transformative powers of love. The show, which will move adults as well as children under 10, is like its title character: It comes wonderfully, thrillingly alive. At 1 p.m., DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dr2kidstheatre.com; twusa.org; $39; $32 for groups of six or more.‘A Voyage Through Jewish History’ (Sunday through Thursday) This journey involves not just miles, but years. In this new permanent interactive exhibition at the Jewish Children’s Museum, young visitors can travel from Abraham and Sarah’s tent to the Western Wall in contemporary Jerusalem and beyond. Activities along the way include giving water to Rebecca’s camels, playing the strings on David’s harp (a high-tech version with beams of light that emit sounds when struck) and taking part in the exodus from Egypt. Museum hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; to 6 p.m. on Sundays; 792 Eastern Parkway, at Kingston Avenue, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 907-8833, jcm.museum. Free with admission: $13; $10 for 65+; free for under 2.WinterGreen Festival: A Tu B’Shvat Celebration (Sunday) It may be winter, but in the Jewish calendar it is also time to celebrate the approaching spring with Tu B’Shvat, a kind of New Year’s festival honoring trees and their fruit. This event at the Museum at Eldridge Street will focus on family trees as well as physical ones. Children can enjoy a traditional Tu B’Shvat Seder, join genealogy workshops, make challah, go on tours of the “green” restoration of the Eldridge Street Synagogue and participate in a concert by Bash the Trash, using handmade instruments they’ve built during the day. From 1 to 4 p.m., 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0888, eldridgestreet.org; $10; $8 for students and 65+; $6 for ages 5 to 18. LAUREL GRAEBER"

A searchable guide to these and other shows is at nytimes.com/events.Melissa Aldana Quartet (Friday and Thursday) A searching and self-assured young tenor saxophonist originally from Santiago, Chile, Melissa Aldana has earned the vocal support of Greg Osby, who released her most recent album, “Second Cycle,” on his Inner Circle label. On Friday she leads a trio with the bassist Pablo Menares and the drummer Greg Hutchinson; on Thursday she draws more directly from the album, with Mr. Menares, the trumpeter Gordon Au and the drummer Jochen Rueckert. Friday at 7:30, 9:30 and 11:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; $12 cover, with a one-drink minimum. Thursday at 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $15, $10 for members in the first set; $10, $5 for members in the second set. (Nate Chinen)Howard Alden and Warren Vaché (Thursday) Most present-day jazz traditionalists need no introduction to Mr. Alden, a nimble guitarist, or Mr. Vaché, a soulful cornetist. Both musicians are thoughtful stewards of swing, and their companionable history runs deep — reason enough to applaud this booking in one of the city’s cozier jazz rooms. At 8:30 and 10:30 p.m., Bar Next Door, 129 Macdougal Street, near West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 529-5945, lalanternacaffe.com; $12 cover for each set, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)Omer Avital & the Band of the East  (Wednesday and Thursday) Mr. Avital, an Israeli bassist drawn to knockabout rhythm, has an engaging recent album, “Suite of the East” (Anzic), that reflects his global vision. His Band of the East typically includes Greg Tardy on tenor saxophone, Nadav Remez on guitar and Daniel Freedman on drums. From 9:30 p.m. to midnight, Smalls Jazz Club, 183 West 10th Street, West Village, (212) 252-5091, smallsjazzclub.com; $20 cover. (Chinen)Patricia Barber Quartet (Thursday through Feb. 2) Ms. Barber’s verbosity and arch intellectualism are uncommon traits for a jazz singer, and she has sometimes been held at arm’s length by wary traditionalists. Her new album, “Smash” (Concord Jazz), won’t change that dynamic — see “Redshift,” a bossa nova that addresses the ups and downs of romance in the language of astrophysics — but it’s a good showcase for her talents, and for the working band that she brings here, featuring the guitarist John Kregor, the bassist Larry Kohut and the drummer Jon Deitemyer. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25, $30 next Friday and Saturday. (Chinen)Jim Black Trio  (Monday) Jim Black is known as a drummer of convulsive intensity and a bandleader rooted in the protocols of noise-rock. But on “Somatic” (Winter & Winter), his most recent album, he leads an acoustic trio much like this one, which has Teddy Klausner on piano and Chris Tordini on bass. Joining as a featured guest is the alto saxophonist Tim Berne, Mr. Black’s former bandleader in Bloodcount, a heavy-gauge fixture of the 1990s downtown scene. At 8 and 9 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $10 cover. (Chinen)Jane Ira Bloom Quartet (Sunday) Ms. Bloom, a soprano saxophonist with an exploratory ken, has committed to an all-ballads program in this engagement, though that hardly qualifies as a restriction for her. She’ll have responsive support from her rhythm section, with Dominic Fallacaro on piano, Cameron Brown on bass and Matt Wilson on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Cyrus Chestnut 50th Birthday Celebration (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Chestnut, a sure-footed pianist with a particular gift for gospel flourish, turned 50 last week. He is commemorating that milestone this week with his working quartet — featuring Stacey Dillard on saxophones, Dezron Douglas on bass and Neal Smith on drums — and as a special guest on Friday and Saturday only, the venerable tenor saxophonist Jimmy Heath. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 cover, $45 cover on Saturday, $15 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum; some sets are sold out. (Chinen)★ Jimmy Cobb Quartet  (Friday and Saturday) The masterly hard-bop drummer Jimmy Cobb turned 84 last weekend; he continues his celebration on the bandstand, leading a quartet with the tenor saxophonist Javon Jackson, the pianist George Cables and the bassist John Webber. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; $35 cover. (Chinen)Bill Cunliffe Trio (Friday) An accomplished pianist and composer in the modern jazz mainstream, Bill Cunliffe doesn’t surface all that often here, having fruitfully established a home base in Los Angeles. For this one-nighter, he calls on the bassist Todd Coolman and the drummer John Riley, a reliable rhythm team. At 8 and 10 p.m., Kitano Hotel, 66 Park Avenue, at 38th Street, (212) 885-7119, kitano.com; $25 cover, with a $15 minimum. (Chinen)Roman Filiu Quintet (Saturday) The alto saxophonist Roman Filiu has kept exalted company in and out of his homeland, Cuba — he apprenticed with both the pianist Chucho Valdés and the saxophonist David Murray — and he has recently been blazing his own trail through the New York scene. Drawing partly from “Musae” (World Culture Music), the assertively modern album he released last year, he leads a band that includes David Virelles on piano and Adam Rogers on guitar. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)★ Al Foster (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Foster has long been a drummer of laid-back locomotion, no less intense for sounding so casual. He’s been working at the Village Vanguard this week with an alert quartet that includes Eric Alexander on tenor saxophone, Adam Birnbaum on piano and Doug Weiss on bass. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)GV3/TB3 Reinvented (Thursday) Two young bands with an abundance of composure, though their naming conventions could stand to be reconsidered. GV3, which plays at 8:30 p.m., is shorthand for Geoff Vidal Trio, led by Mr. Vidal, a tenor saxophonist from New Orleans, and featuring a flexible rhythm team of Linda Oh on bass and Colin Stranahan on drums. And TB3, performing at 10 p.m., stands for Tyler Blanton Trio, led by Mr. Blanton, a vibraphonist, and otherwise consisting here of Mr. Vidal, Mr. Stranahan and the bassist Matt Penman. (The arithmetic is iffy too.) At Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 for each, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Nicole Henry Quintet (Tuesday and Wednesday) Nicole Henry, a jazz singer of pop instinct and cabaret sophistication, celebrates the release of “So Good, So Right: Nicole Henry Live” (Banister). That album, recorded during an engagement at Feinstein’s at Loews Regency last year, features new arrangements of songs from the 1970s. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 cover, $15 for students at select sets, with a minimum of $10. (Chinen)★ Vijay Iyer Trio (Friday through Sunday) The standout jazz album of 2012, at least by critical consensus, was “Accelerando” (ACT), a brilliant second effort from this aerodynamic trio. Led by the pianist Vijay Iyer and featuring the bassist Stephan Crump and the drummer Marcus Gilmore, the group strikes a balance of cleverly reframed cover tunes and vertiginously propulsive originals, finding endless traction in changeable rhythm. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30, $25 on Sunday. (Chinen)Marc Johnson and Eliane Elias  (Tuesday through Feb. 2) Mr. Johnson, a bassist of deeply sonorous style, and Ms. Elias, a pianist with a transparent touch and a fondness for subtle harmonic shading, recently released a lovely album together, “Swept Away” (ECM), with the saxophonist Joe Lovano and the drummer Joey Baron. For this engagement, the headliners, a husband-and-wife team, work with the veteran drummer Victor Lewis. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $35 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Nadje Noordhuis Quintet  (Saturday) The trumpeter Nadje Noordhuis is probably best recognized for her role in Darcy James Argue’s Secret Society, though her self-titled recent debut on the Little Mystery label is slowly changing that. The album revolves around Ms. Noordhuis’s introspective compositions for a chamberlike ensemble that includes the violinist Sara Caswell, the classical guitarist Rupert Boyd and the bassist Joe Martin, all of whom rejoin her here. (Performing an opening set is the effervescent singer Jo Lawry, a featured vocalist on Sting’s recent tours.) At 7:30 p.m., Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org; $20. (Chinen)Linda Oh Quartet  (Friday) As on her propulsive second album, “Initial Here” (Greenleaf), the bassist Linda Oh features her own compositions, and the occasional sacramental cover, for a slashing postbop quartet featuring the tenor saxophonist Dayna Stephens, the pianist Fabian Almazan and the drummer Rudy Royston. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)John Pizzarelli Quartet  (Tuesday through Feb. 2) You may have spotted John Pizzarelli on television with Paul McCartney at last year’s Grammy Awards ceremony, playing music from the former Beatle’s standards album. It’s yet one more example — along with his own recent album, “Rockin’ in Rhythm: A Tribute to Duke Ellington” (Telarc) — of how Mr. Pizzarelli, a charismatic singer as well as a crisp guitarist, has solidified his stature as a modern exemplar of jazz-rooted cabaret. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Jason Rigby’s Cleveland-Detroit Trio  (Saturday) The name of this group corresponds to its background: Mr. Rigby, a tenor saxophonist, hails from Cleveland, while his band mates, the bassist Cameron Brown and the drummer Gerald Cleaver, hail from Detroit. Their rapport is meant to reflect those origins, with earthiness and groove. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with $10 minimum. (Chinen)Diane Schuur (Tuesday through Feb. 3) A flinty and irrepressible jazz singer, Ms. Schuur has a new album, “Live,” that offers a fair indication of what she’ll deliver here, with a band organized by the pianist Alan Broadbent and featuring Joel Frahm on saxophones, Romero Lubambo on guitar, Ben Wolfe on bass and Ulysses Owens Jr. on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)Omar Sosa and Paolo Fresu (Friday through Sunday) Mr. Sosa, a Cuban pianist and composer, and Mr. Fresu, an Italian trumpeter, have collaborated fruitfully before, notably on the 2011 album “Alma” (Ota), which flutters in the jet stream of global pop. They reprise their lyrical and worldly rapport here, with no additional accompaniment. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $25 at tables, $15 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)Becca Stevens Band (Thursday) A vocalist and guitarist who balances deep melody against lyrical caprice, Ms. Stevens has been touring behind “Weightless,” a bright album released last fall on Sunnyside. Her working band, which seeks a folkloric flexibility, typically has Liam Robinson on accordion and piano, Chris Tordini on bass and Jordan Perlson on drums. At 8:30 p.m., Shapeshifter Lab, 18 Whitwell Place, Park Slope, Brooklyn, shapeshifterlab.com; $15 cover. (Chinen)★ David Virelles and Continuum (Tuesday through Feb. 3) A freethinking young Cuban pianist, Mr. Virelles released one of last year’s best and most intriguing albums: “Continuum” (Pi), an ever-shifting amalgam of ancient folklore and avant-garde protocol. Next week Mr. Virelles presents this project at the Village Vanguard, where he has worked in bands led by the saxophonists Chris Potter and Mark Turner. He’ll have the same rhythm section as on the album: the bassist Ben Street, the percussionist-poet Román Díaz, the venerable drummer Andrew Cyrille. And on Thursday only, he’ll welcome a distinguished guest: the multi-reedist and composer Henry Threadgill. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)Ben Williams and Sound Effect (Tuesday and Wednesday) As on “State of Art” (Concord), his polished recent debut, the bassist Ben Williams offers his portrait of modern jazz at the crossroads of pop and R&B, with help from the saxophonist Marcus Strickland, the guitarist Alex Wintz, the pianist Christian Sands and the drummer John Davis. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover. (Chinen)"

A searchable, critical guide to theater is at nytimes.com/events.Previews and Openings‘All in the Timing’  (in previews; opens on Feb. 12) Fresh from his well-reviewed Broadway production of “A Christmas Story, the Musical,” John Rando directs the 20th-anniversary revival of this collection of six one-act comedies in which David Ives brings his playful perspective and wizardry with language to matters romantic and existential. The cast for the Primary Stages production includes Jenn Harris, Carson Elrod and Matthew Saldivar. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, primarystages.org. (David Rooney)‘All the Rage’  (opens on Wednesday) Martin Moran won an Obie Award in 2004 for “The Tricky Part,” based on his own memoir about persevering after suffering sexual abuse as a child. The intervening years have apparently provided Mr. Moran and his “Tricky Part” director, Seth Barrish, with enough material for another autobiographical solo show and then some. Among the topics included here: political asylum, a Las Vegas funeral, the origins of man, South Africa and a furious stepmother. Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Eric Grode)‘Clive’  (in previews; opens on Feb. 7) After directing Jonathan Marc Sherman’s “Things We Want” for the New Group, Ethan Hawke reunites with that playwright and company to stage this premiere inspired by Bertolt Brecht’s “Baal.” Mr. Hawke also plays the title character in this modern update, which traces the slide from success to self-destruction of a songwriter in 1990s New York. Brooks Ashmanskas, Vincent D’Onofrio and Zoe Kazan also star in the production, which features live performances of classic American songs. Acorn Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)‘Fiorello!’ (opens on Wednesday) Has it really been 19 years since City Center’s Encores! series began poking around in the less familiar corners of the Broadway musical canon, unearthing underrated gems like “One Touch of Venus,” “Juno” and “Chicago”? The series begins its 20th season by revisiting its first production, the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1959 ode to Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia of New York. (Not so coincidentally, he is credited with saving City Center from the wrecking ball.) Danny Rutigliano stars in the title role, and Shuler Hensley and Emily Skinner are among his co-stars. City Center, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Grode)‘Isaac’s Eye’  (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Feb. 9) It’s “Amadeus” with optics! Once again an enterprising playwright (Lucas Hnath, in this case) has attempted to look at centuries-old culture by having a young genius (and partly named title character) do battle with an older contemporary, rising to far greater notoriety when all is said and done. It worked for Mozart, and now it’s Isaac Newton’s turn, with the scientist Robert Hooke filling in as the embittered eminence destined to relative obscurity. Ensemble Studio Theater, 549 West 52nd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, ensemblestudiotheatre.org. (Grode)‘Katie Roche’  (previews start on Saturday; opens on Feb. 25) To the extent that New York theatergoers know anything about the 20th-century Irish playwright Teresa Deevy, it is because of the Mint Theater. The enterprising theater, which is also publishing two volumes of her writings, wraps up its three-play Deevy retrospective with this 1936 drama about a wildly ambitious servant girl. The Abbey Theater brought it to America in 1937, but this is the first American production. The Mint’s artistic director, Jonathan Bank, directs once again. 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, minttheater.org. (Grode)‘Luck of the Irish’ (previews start on Monday; opens on Feb. 11) Kirsten Greenidge made a splash in 2011 with her Obie Award-winning play “Milk Like Sugar,” about teenage pregnancy. Her new play may sound familiar to “Clybourne Park” fans; it also looks at race relations, filtered through the eyes of black and white inhabitants of the same house over multiple generations. Ms. Greenidge’s play is about the tensions that rise when an Irish family, which is paid to “ghost buy” a house in an all-white Boston neighborhood for a black family in the 1950s, comes back to claim the house. Her “Milk” director, Rebecca Taichman, returns for this one. Claire Tow Theater, Lincoln Center, 150 West 65th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com, lct3.org. (Grode)‘Moose Murders’  (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Wednesday) Last year saw high-profile New York productions of “Carrie” and “Merrily We Roll Along,” two bombs of the 1980s. Now it’s time for this one-performance debacle, which sent critics running for their thesauruses to describe scenes like the one in which a mummified paraplegic rises from his wheelchair to kick a guy in the groin. Oh, and the guy is wearing a moose costume. The one who is kicked, not the paraplegic. Anyway, it’s back, courtesy of the Beautiful Soup Theater Collective. One worrisome note: The playwright, Arthur Bicknell, “has significantly rewritten and revised ‘Moose Murders’ for this new production.” What’s the fun in that? Connelly Theater, 220 East Fourth Street, East Village, (888) 718-4253, beautifulsoup.showclix.com. (Grode)‘Really Really’  (previews start on Thursday; opens on Feb. 19) The premise of the play sounds less than groundbreaking: College pals turn on one another after a boozy party. But this new play by Paul Downs Colaizzo has plenty going for it, including a good track record (it was a smash for the Signature Theater in Washington last year), TV darlings in the cast (Zosia Mamet of “Girls,” Matt Lauria of “Friday Night Lights”) and, most intriguing of all, the infinitely resourceful director David Cromer (“Tribes,” “Our Town”). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 352-3101, mcctheater.org. (Grode)‘Rodgers and Hammerstein’s Cinderella’  (previews start on Friday; opens on March 3) The 1957 television musical of “Cinderella” was a runaway smash and almost immediately began spawning stage incarnations, starring Eartha Kitt, Everett Quinton and Jean Stapleton (though they weren’t cast in the title role). But this staging is the property’s first appearance on Broadway, complete with a new book by Douglas Carter Beane (“Sister Act,” “The Little Dog Laughed”) and four fairly obscure songs added from the Rodgers and Hammerstein catalog. Laura Osnes stars as Cinderella, and she is surrounded by a formidable trio of scene stealers: Harriet Harris, Victoria Clark and Ann Harada. Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Grode)‘Totally Tubular Time Machine’  (in previews; opens on Feb. 9) Every time a new jukebox assembly appears, musical theater purists complain that the form is being dumbed down into elaborate karaoke. The creators of this show thumb their noses at such charges. This immersive experience allows audiences to time-travel through the 1980s and ’90s and back to the present, joining the party of celebrity excess and pop mash-up. (Saturdays only.) Culture Club, 20 West 39th Street, (212) 921-1999, totallytubularnyc.com. (Rooney)‘The Vandal’ (in previews; opens on Thursday) Since wrapping up his sitcom role on “The New Adventures of Old Christine,” Hamish Linklater has impressed on New York stages in “Seminar” and “School for Lies.” He follows other actors who have recently ventured into playwriting, like Jesse Eisenberg, Zach Braff and Zoe Kazan, with this enigmatic encounter between a woman and a boy who swap stories one cold night at a Kingston, N.Y., bus stop. Jim Simpson directs a cast that includes Zach Grenier, Deirdre O’Connell and Noah Robbins. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Rooney)‘Women of Will’  (previews start on Tuesday; opens on Feb. 3) Quick: How many of William Shakespeare’s title characters are women? The answer is three, though Juliet, Cressida and Cleopatra each have to share the marquee with a guy. By comparison, four different Henrys alone warrant title billing. Tina Packer, the founding artistic director of Shakespeare & Company in Massachusetts, looks to rectify this imbalance with her 15-years-in-the-making exploration of the Shakespearean canon through the eyes of his female characters. Nigel Gore stars with Ms. Packer, but expect the focus to be on Beatrice, Portia, Viola, Lady Macbeth and many other women. Gym at Judson Memorial Church, 55 Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (866) 811-4111, judson.org/The-Gym. (Grode)Broadway‘Annie’ James Lapine’s revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)‘Cat on a Hot Tin Roof’ A four-alarm urgency infuses Scarlett Johansson’s performance in Rob Ashford’s oxygen-starved revival of Tennessee Williams’s 1955 drama of sex and lies. If Ms. Johansson is oddly un-feline as Maggie the Cat, she sure has presence. The rest of the cast, including Benjamin Walker and Ciaran Hinds, gets lost in the heavy atmospherics (2:40). Richard Rodgers Theater, 226 West 46th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)‘The Heiress’ Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman’s revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz’s sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow and — aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey — about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)★ ‘The Mystery of Edwin Drood’  A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes’s Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Charles Isherwood)‘Newsies’  This Disney musical — adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 — markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)‘Nice Work if You Can Get It’ Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O’Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)★ ‘Once’  This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens — based on the 2006 movie — inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (“Black Watch”), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)‘The Other Place’  Laurie Metcalf gives a captivating, complicated performance in Sharr White’s clever puzzle of a drama, portraying a woman grappling with sudden onset of a mysterious illness at the same time as her personal life — disloyal husband (Daniel Stern), estranged daughter (Zoe Perry) — threatens to implode. Joe Mantello’s nimble direction ratchets up the suspense (1:10). Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Isherwood)‘Picnic’  A torso stars in Sam Gold’s stultifying revival of William Inge’s time-yellowed 1953 play, set in lusty, dusty Kansas. The torso belongs to Sebastian Stan as a handsome drifter whose bare pecs and abs stir deep longings in lonely bosoms. Those being stirred include Maggie Grace, Elizabeth Marvel, Ellen Burstyn and the excellent Mare Winningham (2:05). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Brantley)★ ‘Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?’ Pam MacKinnon’s shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee’s hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of “August: Osage County” fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)Off Broadway‘Bare’ Stafford Arima directs this tragic tale of star-cross’d gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of “Romeo and Juliet.” Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the “It Gets Better” era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)★ ‘Bethany’  A single mother (the terrific America Ferrera) fights to win back custody of her child — lost to foster care when she became homeless — in Laura Marks’s smart, compassionate play, featuring a fine supporting cast and sensitive direction by Gaye Taylor Upchurch (1:30). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)‘Le Cid’ When Rodrigue’s father is insulted, Rodrigue must seek vengeance. Inconveniently, his target happens to be his future father-in-law. It is the original Corneillian dilemma, named for this 1636 play by Pierre Corneille, of a choice between honor and love. The infatuations with face-saving veer from the tragic to the comic, usually by design. An uneven cast struggles with some of the meatier roles, but the rarely produced masterwork is still worth seeing (1:55). Theater of the Church of Notre Dame, 405 West 114th Street, at Morningside Drive, Morningside Heights, (212) 868-4444, stormtheatre.com. (Catherine Rampell)‘Cougar the Musical’ Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of “Menopause: The Musical” and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)★ ‘Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking’ Gerard Alessandrini’s essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld’s caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles’ heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)‘Forever Dusty’ If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)★ ‘Fried Chicken and Latkes’  Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor’s Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)‘In Acting Shakespeare’  What began as an homage to Ian McKellen’s one-man show “Acting Shakespeare” has become a boisterous, agreeable and somewhat glib tale of acting Shakespeare. The eager-to-please James DeVita charts his progress from histrionics to honesty, interwoven with bits of Shakespeare biography and plenty of dog-eared soliloquies (1:45). Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Grode)‘The Jammer’  Rolin Jones’s thin comic strip of a play finds a humble Everyman from Brooklyn (the fine Patch Darragh) leaving behind his beloved girl to chase a dream of becoming a roller derby star (1:30). Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)‘Life and Times: Episodes 1-4’  An epic journey through the life of a young woman growing up in Rhode Island, as recollected at Wagnerian length in the disjointed, disorganized language of everyday speech. (The script is a literal transcription of several phone conversations.) Pavol Liska and Kelly Copper, directors of the Nature Theater of Oklahoma, have created a magnum opus that seeks to transform trivial material into magical theater. They more or less succeed, though only those with affection for endurance-test theater will leave cheering rather than exhausted (Episode 1: 3:15; Episode 2: 2:00; Episode 3 and 4: 2:30). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Isherwood)‘My Name Is Asher Lev’  Aaron Posner’s adaptation of Chaim Potok’s novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place — the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)‘Not by Bread Alone’  This singular touring production from the Nalagaat Theater of Israel is performed entirely by deaf and blind actors. Directed by Adina Tal, the show is strongest when its cast members describe the sensory content of their lives. The flashier diversions (slapstick, dance, comic vignettes) cater bluntly to a hearing and seeing audience (1:30). New York University Skirball Center, 566 La Guardia Place, at Washington Square South, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, nyuskirball.org. (Brantley)‘Old Jews Telling Jokes’  With old jokes, a few songs and a little schmaltz, this winning revue is simple, effective entertainment executed with obvious affection (1:20). Westside Theater, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Jason Zinoman)★ ‘The Suit’  Devastation by enchantment, courtesy of the great director Peter Brook and the Théâtre des Bouffes du Nord. Even as it draws you in like the gregarious host of a spirited party, this simply told tale of adultery in apartheid South Africa is quietly preparing to break your heart. Four actors and three musicians make beautiful magic together (1:15). Harvey Theater, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 651 Fulton Street, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org. (Brantley)★ ‘Water by the Spoonful’ Quiara Alegría Hudes’s moving collage of lives in crisis, the 2012 winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama, is the second part of a trilogy centering on the Ortiz family. Elliot (the fine Armando Riesco), a former Marine injured in Iraq, struggles with the loss of the aunt who raised him and a tempestuous reconnection with the ex-crack-addict mother who abandoned him (2:10). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)Off Off Broadway★ ‘Patti Issues’ In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men’s propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/movies/highlights-of-the-sundance-film-festival.html,"PARK CITY, Utah — This year’s Sundance Film Festival, marked by aesthetic ambition, a formidable female presence and enough on-screen sex to take the chill off, gives optimistic proof of the state of American independent cinema. Under the affable, low-key leadership of John Cooper, who took over as festival director in 2009, Sundance has firmly settled into a groove, one that places movies above buzz. Celebrities, freebies and brands remain part of the clamorous mix — after the premiere of his experimental short “Interior. Leather Bar.” James Franco laughingly said that he had picked up his red Christmas sweater from Dockers — but, as at other screenings, there was more to that night than stargazing.One of the sharpest, best surprises of the festival, which ends Sunday, “Interior. Leather Bar.” is a serious yet playful hourlong deconstruction of the representation of homosexuality as viewed through the prism of “Cruising,” William Friedkin’s 1980 film about an undercover cop, played by a supremely jittery Al Pacino, searching for a killer of gay men. “Interior,” directed by Mr. Franco and Travis Mathews, uses as its conceptual jumping-off point a lost 40-minute segment of “Cruising” set in a gay leather bar that Mr. Friedkin has said he had to cut to avoid an X rating. “Interior” primarily turns on the on-set experience of Val Lauren, an actor who appears as himself and as an idea of Mr. Pacino’s, while performing in a re-creation of the missing “Cruising” material.A self-aware exploration of masculine desire and cinematic representation, “Interior” would make an excellent double bill with another of this year’s best selections, “Don Jon’s Addiction.” Directed by Joseph Gordon-Levitt, who also stars as the title libertine, “Don Jon’s” pivots on a New Jerseyan whose addiction to pornography transcends his relationships with living, breathing women. Working in initially broad strokes that become progressively more nuanced as the narrative deepens, Mr. Gordon-Levitt explores what happens to Don Jon when he tries to settle down with a woman (a terrific Scarlett Johansson, doing one of her finest interpretations of a succulent peach), whose realness poses a challenge to Don Jon’s reliance on his plastic pleasures. In its current amusingly smutty state, the movie, which was picked up for distribution here, will probably face its own ratings battle.“Don Jon’s Addiction,” part of a strong lineup in the noncompetitive premieres section, was one of a number of movies that had attendees wondering if the programmers had sexed up the festival or the world at large had. Whatever the case, titles like “Lovelace,” a thankfully nonexploitative biopic from Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman about the life and depressing times of the “Deep Throat” star Linda Boreman, a k a Linda Lovelace (a very fine, vulnerable Amanda Seyfried), were among a number of entries that put sex front and center(fold). The sleaze also rises in “The Look of Love,” Michael Winterbottom’s flat look at the British sex-entertainment mogul Paul Raymond (Steve Coogan), whose twisted road from naughty to nasty was lined with coke and casualties.Two other premieres, “Two Mothers” and “Very Good Girls,” told much the same tale, though with a generational difference. Enjoyably absurd, “Two Mothers” centers on two lifelong friends (the well-matched Naomi Watts and Robin Wright), who embark on passionate affairs with each other’s adult, Adonis-like sons. The French director Anne Fontaine approaches the overheated material with intense gravity, but the excesses of both the story and her choices — it’s all terribly blond, sweaty and serious — steer the results toward the perilously parodic. After a screening, Ms. Fontaine told an audience she was surprised to discover that she had made a comedy, an apparent reference to all the earned, unearned, derisive and clearly uncomfortable laughter that her movie inspired.In “Very Good Girls” the American screenwriter turned first-time feature director Naomi Foner tracks the relationship ups and downs of teenage best friends (a delicate, emotionally nuanced Dakota Fanning and Elizabeth Olsen, bringing to mind Ms. Foner’s daughter, Maggie Gyllenhaal) whose bond is nearly severed by a summer distraction (Boyd Holbrook). Undercut by conventional flourishes like overbearing, telegraphing music and generational miscues — these teenagers don’t text, and one reads Sylvia Plath — “Very Good Girls” feels very much like a project that Ms. Foner has been nurturing for some time. In any event, the festival certainly seems to take care of its own: Ms. Foner has long served as a creative adviser for the labs run by its parent organization, the Sundance Institute.The big, promising news going into the festival was that for the first time women accounted for half of the directors in the American dramatic competition section. As longtime attendees know, women have always done better and received more attention at Sundance than they generate in the outside film world, especially in the studios. (This was confirmed by a new study commissioned by the Sundance Institute and Women in Film, and released during the festival, which looks at the shameful gender inequities in the industry.) At the same time no female directors have been able — or perhaps have received the opportunity — to parlay their Sundance success into the kinds of careers enjoyed by festival alumni who have blown up as big as Quentin Tarantino and Christopher Nolan.Sundance remains somewhat of a bubble, at least in terms of diversity. When the movies are as good as their good intentions, it can be a beautiful bubble, as with George Tillman Jr.’s touching melodrama “The Inevitable Defeat of Mister and Pete,” Andrew Dosunmu’s visually splendid “Mother of George” and (at last!) a darkly romantic Beat movie, “Kill Your Darlings” (directed by John Krokidas, with a deeply committed Daniel Radcliffe as Allen Ginsberg). But once the festival ends, the good vibes and excitement about new, alternative voices and faces fades until next time. There are exceptions. Most recently “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which over the last year has metamorphosed from a Sundance sensation — one partly nurtured by the Sundance Institute — into an Oscar contender. It is an exemplar of representational diversity and true independence among the studio bland and canned.Those looking for the next “Beasts” at this year’s festival, however, would have been disappointed. Although selections like David Lowery’s “Ain’t Them Bodies Saints,” yet another movie dreaming of Terrence Malick, earned eager early word, no one film dominated; rather, a number of titles shared the love and the buzz. Among the most adoringly received was Richard Linklater’s “Before Midnight,” a near-perfect follow-up to “Before Sunrise” and “Before Sunset.” Once again, the superbly matched Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy resume their roles as peripatetic lovers whose relationship with each other and with the greater world comes alive through their prickly, often very funny and plaintively honest conversations. As they walk and talk, this time in Greece, the lovers worry old wounds and jab open new ones in a movie that shifts from paved street to hotel room, from love to hate with scarcely a stumble.The independent world has changed profoundly since “Before Sunrise” played in the 1995 festival. By the mid-1990s it had started to feel that Sundance was willingly shaping itself into a steppingstone for filmmakers looking to make the studio leap. Some directors, like Bryan Singer, took the jump, going from “Public Access” obscurity to the “X-Men” franchise, while others, like Mr. Linklater, hewed to a more idiosyncratic trajectory. These days the divide between the majors and the independents is not just blurred, it also can seem irrelevant in a contemporary media world in which directors shuffle from movies to television and back, and sometimes struggle in the nominally independent realm while flourishing in the more adventurous corners of the major studio machine.Several of the best movies at this year’s festival offered further evidence of blurred divides. “Crystal Fairy,” which played in the world cinema dramatic competition, was directed by the Chilean filmmaker Sebastián Silva and features two North Americans, the hilariously contrapuntal Michael Cera and Gaby Hoffman, as reluctant fellow travelers on parallel Chilean trips, one geographic, the other hallucinogenic. As a free spirit who’s more complex than she seems, Ms. Hoffman walks away with “Crystal Fairy,” often in the glorious and hairy nude. Mr. Cera, who sought out Mr. Silva after seeing his movie “The Maid,” also collaborated on another festival title, “Magic Magic,” about another Chilean adventure, this one with Juno Temple, that goes wrong, if in a far darker, less appealing key.Another festival high point, “Blue Caprice,” was bankrolled by primarily American producers and directed by Alexandre Moors, a French filmmaker living in New York, which may explain why it wasn’t slotted into either the domestic or world competitions. The spare, smart, largely exposition-unencumbered script by Mr. Moors and R. F. I. Porto traces the relationship between the serial killers John A. Muhammad (Isaiah Washington, ferociously magnetic) and Lee Boyd Malvo (Tequan Richmond, a slow heartbreaker) before the two embarked on their murderous sniper rampage in 2002. An exploration of power, madness and grotesque paternalism, the movie refuses any easy answer. Rather, it reveals layer by painful layer how these two, in their crushing isolation and shared madness, transformed from the recognizably human to the monstrously human."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/arts/television/distinguishing-sportacus-on-luckytown-from-spartacus.html,"Here at the Bureau for Solving Problems That May or May Not Be Problems, we have been on high alert all week because of the impending premiere of yet another installment of perhaps the most vile series on television, “Spartacus.”Our worry is not simply that a fresh batch of graphic limb severings and gratuitous breast barings is about to be unleashed on the television landscape; such stuff will always be with us. No, our concern is, as always, for the children. Specifically for those children who might accidentally stumble on the decidedly adults-only “Spartacus” while searching for the kid-friendly Sportacus.Sportacus is a somewhat embarrassing but heroic character on “LazyTown,” a show now in perpetual reruns on PBS Kids Sprout and elsewhere, and aimed at preschoolers. “Spartacus” is, of course, the gladiator-themed series that returns to Starz on Friday night with a new season subtitled “War of the Damned.”We here at the bureau are afraid that a toddler with a voice-activated remote control and poor diction who is looking to spend some time with Sportacus might end up instead in the “Spartacus” version of ancient Rome, where the language is vulgar, and the bloodshed and copulation are copious. This would be an unfortunate mistake, because while Sportacus encourages fitness and healthy eating, “Spartacus” takes aim at pretty much every base instinct human beings have. The first eight minutes of the “War of the Damned” premiere cover bloodlust, carnal indulgence, vulgarity and don’t-try-this-at-home swordplay, not to mention laughably inept special effects.Most parents, we at the bureau know, are too busy to monitor their children’s television viewing every second of the day and often can’t distinguish appropriate shows from inappropriate ones, even when they are paying attention. So we’ve prepared this guide to help concerned moms and dads determine whether their preschoolers are watching Sportacus or “Spartacus.” Clip and save:If the dominant wardrobe colors are brown and gray, and the men are costumed in something that resembles an adult diaper, your child is watching “Spartacus.” Sportacus and the other LazyTowners generally go for a sleek look in primary colors, but Spartacus and his warriors prefer dingy, minimalist garb, a sort of ancient metal-and-leather Depend whose main benefit is to leave a maximum amount of torso for well-oiled display. The women lean toward flimsy garments that fall to the floor at the slightest provocation. Modesty, it appears, was not a significant part of ancient Roman culture.If men twirl rather than flip, your child is watching “Spartacus.” The preferred acrobatic move in Spartacus’ Rome is the no-look decapitation, accomplished in battle by twirling with sword extended in such a way as to remove the head of whoever is standing behind you. Sportacus is also gymnastically inclined but favors handsprings and front flips and rarely decapitates anyone. But it should be noted that he does occasionally speak sternly to Robbie Rotten, the anti-exercise, pro-candy villain of LazyTown.If the bleeding in the show is always in slow motion, your child is watching “Spartacus.” This season Spartacus is leading a rebellion against Rome, and it begins with a vast battle that shows off this series’s best skill, such as it is: capturing blood as it spurts, splatters and sprays in super-slow motion. A character can’t get a paper cut in this series without causing the camera crew to go berserk over the dubious beauty of hemorrhaging, lovingly rendering it in the way a nature cinematographer might show an erupting geyser. This is usually followed by a slow pan of the twitching, dying victims and their lopped extremities and detached entrails, cheesy-looking scenes that appear concocted from a community-theater prop closet.In “LazyTown,” in contrast, residents rarely bleed, though Sportacus and Robbie Rotten did once have a Wild-West-style duel in which Sportacus knocked Robbie’s cowboy hat off with an apple.If characters are alternately speaking in pseudo-Shakespearean gibberish and emitting ferocious GRAWWWWWs, your child is watching “Spartacus.” Sportacus, who is portrayed by an Icelandic fellow named Magnus Scheving, speaks in straightforward if slightly accented English.Over on “Spartacus,” the writers try to give their noxious show a veneer of sophistication by having everyone converse in flowery prose that aims to suggest Shakespeare, a device that also serves to hide the absence of any real plot beyond fighting and fornicating. Their favorite dialogue crutch, though, isn’t a word at all; it’s a lusty, roaring growl, which men emit when killing someone, being killed, celebrating a killing, being tortured, devouring a meal or just when they want to express their manliness.“My incredible macho buffness is beyond human speech,” these roar-growls seem to say. Either that or: “Who are we kidding? No one is watching this moronic show for the dialogue, so let’s just growl.”Other telltale signs that your child has tuned in “Spartacus” rather than Sportacus include the eating of barely cooked meat (Sportacus advocates fruits and vegetables); rampant misogyny (on “Spartacus,” putting a woman to death by nailing her to a cross isn’t enough; she has to be slugged, too); and scenes that mix sex and bloodshed (because sophisticated viewers demand that images of naked bath attendants be intercut with shots of a warrior plunging a sword into another man’s mouth). Sheesh. Even Robbie Rotten would be appalled."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/movies/awardsseason/directors-guild-vs-oscars-an-unusual-year.html,"LOS ANGELES — On Groundhog Day, Hollywood’s black-tie set will watch the Directors Guild of America hand its feature award to a filmmaker whose movie will go on to win the best picture Oscar three weeks later.At least it has worked that way 9 out of 10 times in the last decade.But this year not even Punxsutawney Phil, who emerges to look for his shadow on Feb. 2, can be sure. For those who make an annual game or even business out of Oscar predictions, 2013 has turned into a weird weather year where film directors are concerned.On Jan. 10, three days before the Oscar nominations were announced, the “Gurus o’ Gold,” a panel of 14 awards watchers who write for the likes of Entertainment Weekly and The Hollywood Reporter, got it notably wrong.In a prenomination poll, the Gurus reached a consensus that the nominees for best director would be, in order: Steven Spielberg, for “Lincoln”; Ben Affleck, for “Argo”; Kathryn Bigelow, for “Zero Dark Thirty”; Ang Lee, for “Life of Pi”; and David O. Russell, for “Silver Linings Playbook,” or Tom Hooper, for “Les Misérables.”A handful on the panel threw votes to Michael Haneke, for “Amour,” and two thought Quentin Tarantino would sneak in, with a nomination for “Django Unchained.”But Mr. Affleck, Ms. Bigelow, Mr. Hooper and Mr. Tarantino — who all made relatively large-scale films that have attracted a wide audience — were snubbed in the Oscar voting. Instead Mr. Haneke, whose French-language “Amour” played largely within the confines of an elderly couple’s apartment, was nominated. So was Benh Zeitlin, for his first feature film, the small-scale fable “Beasts of the Southern Wild.”As things go here, it might as well be raining tadpoles.“Absolutely, it was surprising,” said Kristopher Tapley, one of the Gurus. On his blog In Contention, Mr. Tapley had correctly predicted Mr. Haneke’s nomination, but missed the Affleck, Bigelow and Hooper snubs.Chaos in the directing field, Mr. Tapley said in an interview from the Sundance Film Festival this week, probably reflects a certain amount of gamesmanship among Oscar voters. Some, for instance, might want to cut the frequently honored Ms. Bigelow down to size. Or they might have figured that Mr. Affleck would be taken care of by others while they slipped a vote to Mr. Zeitlin.“I was shocked by Benh Zeitlin’s nomination, but more surprised that Ben Affleck was snubbed,” Mr. Tapley said.At any rate, the Directors Guild, normally a reliable Oscar barometer, is now at odds with the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which grants the Oscars. The guild’s nominees include three who are missing from the Academy Awards list — Mr. Affleck, Ms. Bigelow and Mr. Hooper — and leave off Mr. Haneke and Mr. Zeitlin. Only Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Lee overlap.Things got even stranger on Jan. 13, when Mr. Affleck was named best director at the Golden Globes, and “Argo” the best drama, to rousing approval from a crowd that was filled with potential Oscar voters and included the suddenly snubbed front-runner, Mr. Spielberg.Among Hollywood’s players, there has been no shortage of theories about the omissions from the Oscar list of directing nominees. But most of those are offered privately, because Academy members receive a yearly admonition to avoid public discussion of their votes, and because professional awards campaigners risk having their films subjected to disciplinary action by the Academy if they engage in negative talk about rivals.One theory has it that Ms. Bigelow is being punished because some in the Academy interpret “Zero Dark Thirty” as implying that information derived from torture assisted in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.A twist on that theory even suggests that backers of one or another of Ms. Bigelow’s politically connected professional rivals helped prod several powerful senators into criticizing “Zero Dark Thirty.” This theory (which is not advanced by the Bigelow team) would be more tantalizing if it were offered with a shred of evidence, which it isn’t.A less conspiratorial line of thought holds that Ms. Bigelow and Mr. Hooper, having won directing Oscars recently — she for “The Hurt Locker,” he for “The King’s Speech” — were politely set aside by the Academy’s directors branch, which decides the directing nominations. The idea, supposedly, was to make room for Mr. Haneke and Mr. Zeitlin, who had never before been nominated (and, in Mr. Zeitlin’s case, had never made a feature film).That same logic might cover the exclusion of Mr. Tarantino, who was nominated as best director in 2010 for “Inglourious Basterds.” But it doesn’t explain what happened to Mr. Affleck, whose only prior Oscar nomination, and win, came in 1998, when he was honored as co-author of the screenplay to “Good Will Hunting.”A more positive view of Mr. Haneke’s nomination — putting aside the obvious explanation, that he has directed a fine film — is rooted in the historical behavior of the Academy’s directors. By this theory, the branch members, who number about 370, and certainly talk among themselves, occasionally decide to honor a generally overlooked maker of foreign-language films whom they believe to be at the top of his or her game.“It’s not so surprising that he was nominated for directing and screenplay,” Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, which is distributing “Amour” in the United States, said of Mr. Haneke. “The Academy has a long history of this.”So Akira Kurosawa was nominated in 1986 for “Ran”; Lina Wertmüller in 1977 for “Seven Beauties”; François Truffaut in 1975 for “Day for Night”; Ingmar Bergman in 1974 for “Cries and Whispers”; and Federico Fellini in 1962 for “La Dolce Vita.” (None won.)Similarly, in 2001 Mr. Lee was nominated, but didn’t win, for his Chinese-language film “Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon.” In 2006 he won both the directing Oscar and the Directors Guild award for “Brokeback Mountain.” But it became the only film in the last decade to be honored by the guild without later winning the best picture Oscar. (That went to “Crash.”)Still, the simplest explanation for this year’s rejection of filmmakers behind the popular, studio-style movies favored by the Directors Guild (which has 15,000 members who work in various capacities on films and television shows) may lie in the changing identity of the Oscars’ tiny directors branch, which accounts for about 6.5 percent of 5,856 Oscar voters.In recent years death has claimed senior members of the branch, including many who were known for sophisticated mainstream films like those just made by Mr. Affleck and Ms. Bigelow. Among branch members who have died since 2008 are Sydney Pollack, Tony Scott, John Hughes, Blake Edwards and Sidney Lumet.Studio types all, they have been replaced in the branch in recent years almost entirely by foreign-speaking or indie-oriented directors. Those to whom membership was offered lately include the brothers Jean-Pierre Dardenne and Luc Dardenne; Philippe Falardeau; Rodrigo Garcia; Michel Hazanavicius; Michaël Roskam; Wong Kar Wai; Gregg Araki; Neil Burger; Yojiro Takita; Jacques Audiard; and Lone Scherfig.Of 25 directors invited to join the branch in the last three years, only one — Adam Shankman, who directed “Hairspray” and “Rock of Ages” — has deep roots in the studio world. The rest, by and large, have directed, and presumably admire, small or foreign films, like “Amour” and “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” So an evolving electorate in the branch has changed the mix of nominees for the directing Oscar.But Hollywood’s answer to Punxsutawney Phil, the Directors Guild award, may still be the best predictor when it comes to the big picture."

Its debut EP, “Wiki93” (Hot Charity/XL), was released last fall. At 8 p.m., Public Assembly, 70 North Sixth Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, publicassemblynyc.com, (718) 384-4586; $10. (Anderson)Ed Sheeran (Wednesday) Despite hailing from Halifax, England, Mr. Sheeran offers the gently chirping guitar and throaty tenor lilt of modern California surf-pop, that is Jack Johnson and Jason Mraz. Only Rainbow Sandals and sand-encrusted shell art seem beyond his extremely long grasp. His empathetic debut single, “The A Team,” went to No. 3 on the British pop charts, and was crowned the best song of the year at the prestigious Ivor Novello awards last year. At 7 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (866) 858-0008, ticketmaster.com; $35 to $55. (Anderson)★ Tegan and Sara (Monday and Tuesday) The inventive twin sisters Tegan and Sara Quin cast aside their usual, stylishly produced folk-rock gravity on “Closer,” the lead single from their new album, “Heartthrob” (Sire). The song’s sweet examination of first love leans heavily on electro-pop synth pulse and New Wave singsong harmonies. It’s a jarring but convincingly delivered left turn. At 8 p.m., Beacon Theater, 2124 Broadway, at 74th Street, (212) 465-6500, beacontheatre.com; $39.50 to $75. (Anderson)Ultraísta (Monday) This shuffling new trip-hop project from the producer Nigel Godrich, the singer Laura Bettinson and the drummer and multi-instrumentalist Joey Waronker sparks with electronic fizz, Kraut-rock angularity and poised vocals. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, musichallofwilliamsburg.com, (800) 745-3000; $20. (Anderson)The Vaccines (Thursday) After wooing devotees of 1970s-style punk in 2011 with their gruffly exhilarating debut, “What Did You Expect From the Vaccines?” (Columbia), these British upstarts fret about their inadequacies and puff up their guitar licks into stadium portions on the follow-up, “Come of Age” (Columbia). Some moments are striking — especially the purring lounge pace of “I Wish I Was a Girl” — but the group’s confusion with its new scope is palpable. With DIIV and San Cisco. At 8 p.m., Terminal 5, 610 West 56th Street, Clinton, (800) 745-3000, terminal5nyc.com; $25. (Anderson)Chelsea Wolfe (Saturday) Los Angeles is scrutinized with fresh malaise by Ms. Wolfe, whose volatile yelps skip along shuddering, foreboding folk-metal in “Apokalypsis” (Pendu Sound). The dark, aching glamour suits her, if not Rodeo Drive. With King Dude and Starred. At 9 p.m., Music Hall of Williamsburg, 66 North Sixth Street, Brooklyn, (800) 745-3000, musichallofwilliamsburg.com; $15. (Anderson)★ Shara Worden and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus (Friday) The fanciful baroque-pop musician Shara Worden of My Brightest Diamond recently composed a score for “Balloonatic,” a high-flying film by the silent comedian Buster Keaton. The romantic reverberations of her excellent last album, “All Things Will Unwind” (Asthmatic Kitty), had their own levity. She recently wrote three songs for the Brooklyn Youth Chorus, which will perform them here along with other selections by Ms. Worden. At 7 p.m., Merkin Concert Hall, Goodman House, 129 West 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3330, kaufman-center.org; sold out, but the concert can be streamed live via Q2 Music at wqxr.org. (Anderson)★ The xx (Friday) Modern R&B gets an icy upheaval with this young British band, who offer moody mumbles over structured electro-pop underpinnings. “Coexist” (Young Turks), the solid follow-up album to its much-embraced self-titled debut of 2009, was released in September. With Austra. At 8 p.m., Hammerstein Ballroom, 311 West 34th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com; sold out. (Anderson)Zammuto (Saturday) This needling new experimental-rock project from Nick Zammuto, half of the beloved electro-rockers the Books, shares that duo’s proclivity for tinny, irrepressible funk walking lines and expansive acoustics. Its debut performance in TriBeCa last winter was a dizzying, cerebral outing. At 7:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, lepoissonrouge.com; $13 in advance, $15 day of show. (Anderson)"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/movies/movie-listings-for-jan-25-31.html,"MoviesRatings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.★ ‘Amour’ (PG-13, 2:07) A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between, the latest from the great director Michael Haneke (“The White Ribbon,” “Caché”) takes a long, hard, tender look at an elderly French couple, Georges and Anne — played by two titans of French cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva — in their final days. Bring hankies. (Manohla Dargis)★ ‘Anna Karenina’ (R, 2:10) Joe Wright’s version of the Tolstoy novel, with a script by Tom Stoppard, is wildly, sometimes dizzily theatrical, taking place mostly on a series of elaborate stage sets. The story of Anna (Keira Knightley), her humorless husband (Jude Law) and her lover, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) becomes a lush melodrama, counterpointed by the delicate romance of Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and Levin (Domhnall Gleeson). Not a faithful adaptation, by any means, but something better: a bold, lively and ardent re-imagining of the book. (A. O. Scott)★ ‘Argo’ (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)★ ‘Barbara’ (PG-13; 1:45) Christian Petzold directs this tense, smart film about an East German doctor (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been banished to the boonies. There, in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police, she waits and she burns. (Dargis)‘Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin & the Farm Midwives’ (No rating, 1:35) Sara Lamm and Mary Wigmore’s beamingly one-sided ode to natural childbirth showcases Ms. Gaskin’s dislike of the “for-profit hospital system” with glowing images of ecstatically grunting women and zero statistical comparisons of less-than-optimal outcomes. (Jeannette Catsoulis)‘Broken City’ (R, 1:49) The director Allen Hughes’s latest tale about power and its abuse in the city revolves around the moral education of a cop (Mark Wahlberg) who shoots a man dead and is forced to turn in his badge. (Dargis)‘The Central Park Five’ (No rating, 1:59) Directed by Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns, this documentary revisits the 1989 rape and beating of the white woman known as the Central Park jogger and the five black and Latino teenagers accused of assaulting her. The five were imprisoned but later exonerated; the filmmakers look back at what happened and why. (Dargis)★ ‘Chasing Ice’ (PG-13, 1:16) The timing couldn’t be better for this documentary about the work of James Balog, who set out to provide visual evidence of the effects of global warming by taking time-lapse photographs of melting glaciers. The images are as beautiful as they are important. (Neil Genzlinger)★ ‘Django Unchained’ (R, 2:45) Blaxploitation and spaghetti western meet in the Old South in Quentin Tarantino’s latest provocation, with — literally! — explosive results. Jamie Foxx is Django, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), whose partner and protégé he becomes. After the two kill off a bunch of bad guys, they set off to free Django’s wife (Kerry Washington) from captivity at a nightmarish plantation called Candyland. Bloody, farcical and cartoonish, “Django Unchained” is at once a wildly entertaining, borderline-irresponsible fantasy and a bold and serious attempt to use the imaginative resources of popular culture to address an old and durable historical injustice. (Scott)★ ‘56 Up’ (No rating, 2:24) The latest installment in Michael Apted’s remarkable documentary project that has followed a group of Britons since 1964, starting when they were 7, checks in on them at 56. (Dargis)★ ‘Flight’  (R, 2:18) A titanic Denzel Washington plays a veteran commercial pilot whose greatest vocation should be his flying but has instead, for various reasons, become his drinking. Robert Zemeckis directs his finest movie since “Cast Away.” (Dargis)‘Gangster Squad’ (R, 1:53) This brainless, hopped-up, ultraviolent Los Angeles noir, directed by Ruben Fleischer, assembles an impressive cast (including Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone) and some spiffy period costumes. (Scott)‘Greenwich Village: Music That Defined a Generation’  (No rating, 1:32) Even lacking an organized chronology or analytical overview of the early ’60s folk-music movement, this documentary at least evokes the flavor the era. (Stephen Holden)‘A Haunted House’  (R, 1:37) The brand of horror film that features hand-held cameras and found footage probably didn’t need spoofing in the first place, but this clumsy movie tries anyway. It fails, because the writers (Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez) and the director (Mike Tiddes) are content with sophomoric humor and lazy story about a couple (Mr. Wayans and Essence Atkins) who decide to move in together. A demon moves in too. (Neil Genzlinger)‘Hitchcock’ (PG-13, 1:38) Anthony Hopkins, buried under a fat suit and facial prosthetics, stars as Alfred Hitchcock in a movie about the making of “Psycho.” Directed by the fearlessly unsubtle Sacha Gervasi, the movie suggests that the Master of Suspense was himself a little psycho and could only work from a place of madness. It doesn’t merely give creative genius a bad name, it also pathologizes it. An overly glammed-up Helen Mirren plays Hitch’s wife, Alma. (Dargis)‘The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’ (PG-13, 2:50) Peter Jackson’s adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien novel — the first in a trilogy of films — is a slick, bloated, lumbering bore, a profit-minded exercise in theme-park-ride cinema that has neither the charm of the book nor the grandeur of Mr. Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” movies. (Scott)★ ‘Holy Motors’ (No rating, 1:55, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)‘Hors Satan’ (No rating, 1:49, in French) In this visually powerful, intellectually dubious film, the French director Bruno Dumont follows two nameless, barely articulate people — identified in the credits as the Guy and the Girl — through the countryside of northern France. Sexual desire and the possibility of violence hover in the air, as do spiritual intimations made concrete by the possibility that the guy possesses supernatural powers. (Scott)‘Hyde Park on Hudson’ (R, 1:34) Bill Murray plays Franklin D. Roosevelt in a period film directed by Roger Michell and written by Richard Nelson that suggests that the 32nd president of the United States and his distant, woefully dreary cousin, Daisy Suckley (Laura Linney), did more than kiss. Roosevelt was a towering figure, but his life and deeds scarcely register in this amorphous, bafflingly aimless movie. (Dargis)‘The Impossible’ (PG-13; 1:47) A story of survival set against the Asian tsunami of 2004, about a British family (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are the parents) vacationing in Thailand when disaster strikes. The performances are excellent (Tom Holland, as the couple’s oldest son, is especially strong), and the director, Juan Antonio Bayona, deftly recreates the violence of the killer waves and the desolation they left in their wake. Still, something is troubling about the film’s almost complete neglect of the non-Western victims of the tsunami. This is the story of a very bad holiday rather than of a mass catastrophe. (A.O. Scott)‘Jack Reacher’ (PG-13; 2:10) Jack who? If you need to ask, you may be at the wrong movie, but just in case: He is the ex-military vigilante from Lee Child’s series of macho pulp novels, played by Tom Cruise and hunting down killers in the city of Pittsburgh. Much duller than it sounds, except when Werner Herzog or Robert Duvall is on screen. (Scott)‘Just 45 Minutes From Broadway’ (R, 1:48) This reverent sendup, from the prolific Henry Jaglom, borders on farce (but not enough) when dropping in on a family of actors who can’t turn off their performing in life, for better or worse — though the better is sometimes hard to imagine with this crew of hams. Most of the performers do fine work, given the muddy genre, but the film’s crop of clichés is dispiriting. (David DeWitt)‘The Last Stand’ (R, 1:47) Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the top of the bill in this bloody thriller, playing a small-town sheriff about as unconvincingly as is humanly possible. An escaped drug lord is headed for his border town in a souped-up car, and he and some misfit deputies have to stop him. One amusing 60-second stretch of mayhem almost makes up for the formulaic remainder of the film. (Genzlinger)★ ‘A Late Quartet’ (R, 1:45) The upheavals that threaten the future of the fictional Fugue String Quartet in Yaron Zilberman’s magnificently acted film may be wildly exaggerated. But it would be shortsighted to dismiss this deeply felt, musically savvy film set in a refined cultural precinct of Manhattan as sudsy melodrama. (Holden)‘Life of Pi’ (PG, 2:06) In bringing Yann Martel’s beloved novel to the screen, Ang Lee has created a 3-D digital fable that is often stunning to behold. The middle section, in which the title character and a Bengal tiger share a lifeboat after a shipwreck, is touching and clever, but its delicacy is spoiled by a fuzzy, cloying spiritualism that hangs over everything like a humid cloud. (Scott)★ ‘Lincoln’ (PG-13, 2:29) Daniel Day-Lewis plays the Great Emancipator with playful wit as well as gravity. This film, directed by Steven Spielberg from a bristling, discursive script by Tony Kushner, focuses on Lincoln’s political skills and confines itself mainly to a single momentous month in his presidency. Anyone capable of being moved — or appalled — by the workings of democracy is likely to be enthralled by the intricate battle of wills surrounding the passage of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States. The superb supporting cast (including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens) helps turn the movie into a group portrait of leadership in crisis. It’s a democratic masterpiece, a history lesson full of historical detail and honest patriotic emotion. (Scott)‘Luv’  (R, 1:34) A smart and sensitive consideration of manhood from the director Sheldon Candis. Michael Rainey Jr. plays a Baltimore boy who idolizes his uncle (Common), an ex-convict trying to put his life back together. Over a single day, their relationship is tested in various ways, and the movie veers close to crime-thriller clichés. But strong performances and fine attention to emotional detail make it engrossing and moving in spite of its lapses. (Scott)‘Mama’ (PG-13, 1:49) This ghost story starring Jessica Chastain offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don’t often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don’t want anyone to take an ax to them. (Dargis)★ ‘The Master’ (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)‘Matru Ki Bijlee Ka Mandola’  (No rating, 2:30, in Hindi) A mix of gently outraged populism and low-powered romantic comedy, this Hindi film directed by Vishal Bhardwaj (“Omkara” and “Maqbool”) might have been better with a chunk lopped off its two-and-a-half-hour run time. Still, the lazy pace yields some pleasures, especially the performance of Pankaj Kapur as a drunken industrialist. (Rachel Saltz)‘Les Misérables’ (PG-13, 2:37) Tom Hooper (“The King’s Speech”) directs this overly busy screen version of the popular musical with Hugh Jackman as the reformed prisoner, Russell Crowe as his tormentor and Anne Hathaway as the prostitute turned martyr. By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat. (Dargis)‘My Brooklyn’ (No rating, 1:16) As much personal essay as urban-policy survey, Kelly Anderson’s sensitive study of gentrification in her home borough traces a tale of aggressive rezoning, multimillion-dollar development deals and racial displacement. (Catsoulis)★ ‘Not Fade Away’ (R; 1:52) This film, the first feature by David Chase, creator of “The Sopranos,” is a loving, acutely detailed portrait of 1960s rock ’n’ roll culture as experienced by a New Jersey teenager with rock star dreams. (Holden)‘Parental Guidance’ (PG, 1:44) Billy Crystal stars as a baseball announcer who, when not being indulged by his wife (Bette Midler), schools his daughter (Marisa Tomei) and grandkids on the right way to do everything. Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse wrote the script, and Andy Fickman gives it some snap. (Dargis)‘The Perks of Being a Wallflower’ (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who’s rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)★ ‘The Pirogue’ (No rating, 1:27, in French, Wolof and Al Pelaar) This Senegalese film, directed by Moussa Touré, follows 31 would-be immigrants on a perilous boat ride to Europe from Africa. More than the usual topical melodrama, the movie combines documentary immediacy with unsentimental, deeply compassionate humanism. (Scott)‘Promised Land’ (R, 1:46) Matt Damon (who wrote the screenplay with his co-star John Krasinski) plays Steve Butler, dispatched to a small town by an energy conglomerate to buy the rights to underground natural gas from the local farmers. He encounters a mixed welcome, and his job is complicated by the arrival of an aggressive and charming environmental activist (Mr. Krasinski). The cast — also including Frances McDormand, Rosemarie DeWitt and Hal Holbrook — is excellent, and the director, Gus Van Sant, lingers over offbeat details and offhand moments. But when the time comes for the movie to make its point, it falls back on creaky plot twists and puffed-up, over-earnest speeches. (Scott)‘Quartet’ (PG-13, 1:38) A chance to watch vintage British actors in mildly naughty, gently touching circumstances. Dustin Hoffman directed this tale of retired musicians — played by Billy Connolly, Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay, among others — settling old scores and singing old songs. (Scott)‘Rise of the Guardians’ (PG, 1:37) This 3-D animated feature imagines Santa Claus, the Easter bunny, the Tooth Fairy and other imaginary beings as quasi-superheroes with the voices of movie stars, which is pretty cool, as are some of the witty visual touches. Less so is the film’s weary, unimaginative descent into treacly sentiment and overblown action sequences, which are supposedly what the kids want these days. (Scott)★ ‘Rust and Bone’ (R, 2:00, in French) Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet,” “The Beat That My Heart Skipped”) directs this tough and tender melodrama with a ferocious conviction that disguises some of its sentimental soft spots. The Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts plays Ali, a sometime prizefighter and unreliable father who befriends Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard), a trainer of killer whales trying to recover after a terrible accident. The romance that blossoms between them is sexy and volatile, as are the performances, which are absolutely convincing even when the story is not. (Scott)★ ‘Searching for Sugar Man’ (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul’s hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don’t wait for the DVD. (Dargis)★ ‘The Sessions’ (R, 1:35) The movie couple of the year, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt — re-enacting the true story of a disabled, virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate — infuse the movie, directed and written by Ben Lewin, with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor. (Holden)★ ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ (R, 2:00) David O. Russell’s exuberant new comedy tracks the feverish, happy, sad, absurdly funny ups and downs of a head case (Bradley Cooper) just as he returns to his parents’ home after eight months in a mental institution. When he meets a heartbreak beauty (Jennifer Lawrence), he finds fresh purpose in a movie that honks for happiness. (Dargis)★ ‘Skyfall’ (PG-13, 2:23) Directed by a surprisingly suitable Sam Mendes, this latest Bond is a superior follow-up to “Casino Royale,” the 2006 reboot that introduced the excellent Daniel Craig as 007. Playful but never frivolous, it comes off as something of a franchise rethink, partly because it brings in new faces and implies that Bond, like Jason Bourne, needed to be reborn. (Dargis)‘Tabu’ (No rating, 1:58, in Portuguese) The first half of Miguel Gomes’s elegant and elusive black-and-white film concerns a middle-aged woman living alone in present-day Lisbon, who is drawn into the life of her elderly neighbor. The second half tells, without dialogue, the story of that neighbor’s romantic adventures in the last years of Portuguese colonial rule in Africa. The mood of nostalgia — for old movies and for old social arrangements — is beguiling, if also somewhat coy. (Scott)‘Texas Chainsaw 3D’ (R, 1:32) Leatherface, the temperamental brute with a penchant for lumber tools, gives lessons in 3-D homicide to a class of fresh-looking actors (including Alexandra Daddario of “Percy Jackson & the Olympians,” as his long-lost cousin; Scott Eastwood (yes, Clint’s son); and Tremaine Neverson, a k a the singer Trey Songz. They graduate with flying limbs. (Andy Webster)‘This Is 40’ (R; 2:14) Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) play a Los Angeles married couple in Judd Apatow’s sloppy, generous and deeply personal new film. Facing the anxieties of approaching middle age and other related worries, they squabble, act out and wonder if they can find true happiness amid the almost unimaginable privilege they enjoy. (Scott)‘Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 2’ (PG-13. 1:55) Bella, Edward, Jacob and the rest of the fanged and furred gang say so long in this final chapter of the franchise juggernaut. The director Bill Condon, who shepherded “Part 1,” finishes up his tour of duty with some surprisingly energetic and flamboyant violence, and along the way makes the most of a game, fabulous Michael Sheen. (Dargis)★ ‘West of Memphis’ (R, 2:25) A work of fierce documentary advocacy directed by Amy Berg (“Deliver Us From Evil”), “West of Memphis” follows the successful crusade to free three men wrongly convicted of murder more than 18 years ago in a sloppy, hysterical rush to justice. The film is inspiring but infuriating, because the deal to release them from prison allowed their coerced guilty plea to stand. (Holden)★ ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow’s brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid. Written by Mark Boal, the movie is a seamless weave of truth and drama as well as a wrenchingly sad, soul-shaking story about revenge and its moral costs. See it, fight over it, but don’t ignore it. (Dargis)Film SeriesArt Theater Guild and Japanese Underground Cinema, 1960-1986 (through Feb. 10) An extensive series devoted to an independent film company, the Art Theater Guild, that gave voice to the radical sentiments coursing through Japan as the 1960s built to a climax. Seventy-one films will be shown before the retrospective concludes in February, including work by Yukio Mishima, Shohei Imamura and Nagisa Oshima. Museum of Modern Art Roy and Niuta Titus Theater, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)Celebrating the Australian Film Revival  (Friday through Thursday) Courtesy of Australia’s National Film and Sound Archive, this retrospective offers restored prints of several movies that propelled Australia’s emergence as a major player in world cinema in the 1970s. The program includes some oft-cited classics, like Fred Schepisi’s 1978 “The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith” (Friday at 6:15 p.m. and Monday at 4 p.m.), Bruce Beresford’s 1978 “The Getting of Wisdom” (Saturday at 4:30 p.m.), George Miller’s 1979 “Mad Max” (Wednesday at 6 p.m.), Gillian Armstrong’s 1979 “My Brilliant Career,” with Judy Davis (Thursday at 8:30 p.m.) and Peter Weir’s 1975 “Picnic at Hanging Rock” (Thursday at 6:15 p.m.). But there are also several lesser-known films that merit wider exposure, including Tom Jeffrey’s 1979 “The Odd Angry Shot” (Monday at 8:30 p.m.); Tim Burstall’s 1974 “Petersen,” with Jack Thompson (Sunday at 4 p.m.); and a personal favorite, Ken Hannam’s 1975 “Sunday Too Far Away,” a Hawksian study of sheep shearers (Monday at 6:30 p.m. and Wednesday at 4 p.m.). Elinor Bunin Munroe Film Center, Lincoln Center, 144 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5600; Walter Reade Theater, Lincoln Center, 165 West 65th Street, (212) 875-5601, filmlinc.com; $13. (Kehr)Vive la Jeunesse! Young French Directors (Tuesday) Each Tuesday this month the French Institute Alliance Française has been showcasing work by newcomers. The last film in the series is Bijan Anquetil’s “Nuit Remue,” which tells the story of Afghan immigrants on the outskirts of Paris. 55 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (800) 982-2787, fiaf.org; $10. (Kehr)Who-Done-It? At the Movies  (Friday and Saturday) Four movie mysteries presented on the giant screen of the historic Landmark Loew’s Jersey Theater in Jersey City. On Friday at 8 p.m. it’s a Basil Rathbone-as-Sherlock Holmes double feature: the 1942 “Sherlock Holmes and the Secret Weapon” followed by the 1945 “The Woman in Green.” On Saturday, Alfred Hitchcock’s 1956 “To Catch a Thief” will be shown at 6 p.m., with Bryan Singer’s 1995 “The Usual Suspects” following at 8:20 p.m. Landmark Loew’s Jersey Theater, 54 Journal Square, Jersey City, (201) 798-6055, loewsjersey.org; for the double feature Friday, $10, or $8 for seniors and children 12 and younger; for each feature Saturday, $7, or $5 for seniors and children 12 and younger. (Kehr)Paul Williams  (Friday through Sunday) The pixieish singer-songwriter Paul Williams was a familiar figure in the popular culture of the 1970s and ’80s, and today, at 72, he’s the subject of a new documentary: “Paul Williams: Still Alive” by Stephen Kessler. Mr. Williams will be present for the screening of that documentary on Sunday at 3 p.m. Other screenings include three films in which his work was featured: Brian De Palma’s 1974 “Phantom of the Paradise” (Friday, 7 p.m.); James Frawley’s 1979 “The Muppet Movie” (Saturday, 3 p.m.); and Elaine May’s 1987 “Ishtar” (Saturday, 6 p.m.), for which Mr. Williams wrote the deliberately dreadful songs performed by Warren Beatty and Dustin Hoffman.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/arts/television/whats-on-friday.html,"1:30 P.M. (IFC) ABOUT A BOY (2002) In Paul and Chris Weitz’s adaptation of Nick Hornby’s novel Hugh Grant plays Will, a London Lothario with a Peter Pan complex who must face up to his irresponsible ways when Marcus (Nicholas Hoult), the socially inept 12-year-old son of a hippie-dippy single mother (Toni Collette, above, with Mr. Grant, right, and Mr. Hoult), begins to stalk him. Rachel Weisz is the artist on whom Will fixes his sights; he uses Marcus to help seduce her. Writing in The New York Times, A. O. Scott said that “Mr. Grant, leaning on his mumbling charm until it turns into its opposite, is an ideal cad.” Like “High Fidelity,” another of Mr. Hornby’s works, “ ‘About a Boy’ finds redemption in a stale, gooey pop song, in this case Roberta Flack’s ‘Killing Me Softly,’ ” Mr. Scott added. “It’s a cheap trick, but one that’s guaranteed to work every time. You succumb to the movie’s warmth and bonhomie because the alternative is to remain in the isolating, self-protective cynicism from which Will has been lucky to escape.”10:15 A.M. (TMC) THE COMPANY MEN (2010) Ben Affleck, Tommy Lee Jones (from left below) and Chris Cooper portray employees of a Boston company confronting corporate downsizing — the better to justify the chief executive’s $22 million salary on the eve of a probable merger. “Some of the details are wrong,” Stephen Holden wrote in The Times of this feature-film directing debut from John Wells. “Yet the minor miscalculations pale beside the film’s unflinching depiction of the perils of heedless upward mobility that, for all the luxuries it affords, looks pretty grim.” Playing a man who rose from the factory floor to an executive suite, Mr. Cooper, he added, “gives a great, tragic performance of a man who lashes out like a trapped snake when he realizes that, in his words, ‘my life ended, and nobody noticed.’ ”1:45 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/us/a-nun-at-the-crossroads-of-faith-and-film.html,"PARK CITY, Utah — On the day before she entered a Catholic boarding school in August 1967, as a 15-year-old who felt the call to be a nun, Rose Pacatte indulged in a final fling with the secular world. She went to the local drive-in to see “The Dirty Dozen.”While young Rose’s stirrings toward religious life had been inspired in part by films about nuns — “The Song of Bernadette,” “The Trouble with Angels” — she expected that her vows would mean forgoing popular culture. And surely convent life would make no allowance for anything like that final fling movie, Robert Aldrich’s World War II shoot-em-up.Yet this past week, Sister Rose of the Daughters of St. Paul moved through Park City’s starry firmament as Sister Rose of Sundance, a veteran film critic participating in this year’s edition of the renowned indie festival. By the time Sundance ends on Sunday, she will have seen upward of 20 films, blogging and reviewing most of them for The National Catholic Reporter and joining in panel discussions for students from religious colleges and seminaries.In all those ways, Sister Rose was serving not as a sentry protecting religious belief from cinematic product, but rather as a mediator helping to explain one to the other. As such, she embodies a departure both from the religious temptation to police popular culture, in the manner of the Roman Catholic Church’s now-defunct Legion of Decency, and the effort in fundamentalist circles to create a parallel universe of theologically safe movies, television and music.“To paraphrase a Gospel passage, Christ came into the world to redeem the culture, not to condemn it,” Sister Rose, 61, said in an interview here. “It’s a negotiation. You don’t give everything a free pass. Something has to come out of your convictions and values. But what matters isn’t what the movie contains, but what it means.”In other words, Sister Rose does not praise films merely for not having sex, violence or profane language. In a recent online review, for example, she lauded “Silver Linings Playbook” as “a perfect blend of humor, pathos, heart and hope for flawed and broken humanity,” despite the fact that, as she later noted in a conversation, “it’s full of f-bombs.” Here at Sundance, her itinerary included “God Loves Uganda,” a documentary fiercely critical of American Christians for helping to support virulently antigay pastors in that African nation.The closest thing Sister Rose has to an artistic deal-breaker is her abhorrence of gratuitous, excessive violence, which she considers as an affront to human dignity. Tellingly, she has seen but not reviewed the flamboyantly bloody and much-praised Quentin Tarantino film “Django Unchained.” She detested the film’s violence, she said, but considered it somewhat less disturbing for being so cartoonish and unrealistic. Her capsule opinion, then: “It’s ‘Tom and Jerry’ on steroids.”What is undeniable is Sister Rose’s significant role at the crossroads of faith and film. Besides writing for The National Catholic Reporter’s online edition, she reviews for The St. Anthony Messenger, a monthly magazine for Catholic families with a circulation of about 300,000. She has presented talks on topics like “Meeting Jesus at the Movies” and “Media and the Moral Imagination” from Toronto to Oxford to Johannesburg. She has sat on Catholic or ecumenical juries at the Venice and Berlin International Film Festivals, among others.Her trajectory into film criticism, far from being impeded by her religious vocation, was propelled by it. From its founding in 1915, the Daughters of St. Paul embraced mass media, starting with newspapers and books, and progressing into electronic and digital forms. Just two weeks into her residency at the order’s high school, the teenage Rose Pacatte found herself among sisters celebrating the Feast of the Assumption in part by watching a movie from the convent’s collection.After taking her final vows in 1978, and earning a bachelor’s degree in liberal arts six years later, Sister Rose earned a master’s degree in media studies from the University of London. Then what she calls providence placed her in a Daughters of St. Paul mother house in Culver City, Calif., virtually next door to Hollywood.In her reviewing, Sister Rose has eschewed the reductive style of awarding letter grades or stars, preferring to ruminate on “how a film sheds light on the human experience, rather than ‘Is it good or bad.’” She also tends to eschew her nun’s habit when going to see movies.“Because then it becomes about me, not about the art,” she explained. “To walk into a theater for an R-rated movie, and here’s a nun in a veil, people can get whiplash. So I step away from that whole thing. And I can talk to people on the way out of the theater.”Here at Sundance, Sister Rose did much of her talking with 120 students and alumni of Mormon and evangelical Christian colleges participating in the Windrider Forum. Since 2005, the program has engaged filmmakers in public conversation about the role religion does or does not have in their work.The panel on Wednesday morning of festival week concerned “There Will Come a Day,” one of Sundance’s foreign-language selections. The Italian film, written and directed by Giorgio Diritti, follows the personal crisis of a young woman who has miscarried and been vengefully divorced by her husband. She takes refuge with, and solace from, an aunt who is a nun in the Amazon Basin of Brazil.Sister Rose drew out Mr. Diritti about his own religious background — childhood as a faithful Catholic, an adult rebellion against many Vatican positions, a lingering respect for the church’s sense of community. One of the Windrider students, an aspiring filmmaker named Peter Varberg, raised his hand to ask Mr. Diritti which had come first in his film, the religious theme or the narrative line.“He doesn’t start with the idea of writing a religious story,” Sister Rose said, translating from the director’s native Italian. “He starts with the idea that many people suffer.”After the session concluded, Sister Rose rolled over the same issue for herself. “This is the quandary Christian filmmakers have,” she said, almost by implication including herself as a Christian film critic. “They feel so committed to the lesson that they struggle to have the story come out. That’s why you wind up with what I call these ‘Sunday school movies.’ I’m interested in movies for the rest of the week.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/arts/music/at-sfjazz-center-a-genres-boundaries-are-flexible.html,"SAN FRANCISCO — Hours before the opening-night concert for the SFJazz Center here on Wednesday, Randall Kline stood on the floor of the Robert N. Miner Auditorium and briefly slipped into reverie. Onstage, a few feet away, the pianist McCoy Tyner and the vibraphonist Bobby Hutcherson were testing out acoustics and rekindling a partnership; others scurried about, giving the room an expectant hum.“I’m sorry, you’ll have to excuse me,” said Mr. Kline, the founder and executive artistic director of SFJazz, as he took it all in, finally snapping some pictures with his phone. “We’ve been working toward this moment for so long, it almost feels surreal.”In one sense he was referring to the history of SFJazz, a presenting organization that began as a weekend festival called Jazz in the City in 1983 and now ranks among the leaders in its field. But he was also speaking more tangibly about the center, a $64 million, 35,000-square-foot building that suggests a physical manifestation of his organization’s ideals.An approachable three-story structure in glass and concrete, the SFJazz Center is being billed as the nation’s first free-standing building created for jazz. And if the careful wording of that claim suggests a hedge against comparisons with Frederick P. Rose Hall — the $128 million home of Jazz at Lincoln Center, ensconced within the Time Warner Center in Manhattan — it hardly diminishes the extraordinary scope and promise of SFJazz’s achievement.“It’s an impressive building, and has a certain grandeur,” said the saxophonist Joshua Redman on Wednesday. “But it also feels kind of down-to-earth, and like it’s part of the neighborhood.” (Mr. Redman, a former artistic director of SFJazz, happened to be warming up in the center’s Joshua Redman dressing room.)The jazz circuit in this country has always relied on a network of nightclubs, but there are far fewer now than there once were — and not just in San Francisco, which counts Yoshi’s as the exception that proves the rule. For 30 years SFJazz was nomadic, using spaces like the Herbst Theater and Grace Cathedral. Mr. Kline began thinking about a dedicated home more than a decade ago, eager to solidify an identity and establish a consistent standard of production.In 2004 he shared his vision with the Bay Area architect Mark Cavagnero. After weighing options like a partnership with the San Francisco Symphony, they set their sights on a property occupied by an auto repair shop in the emergent-chic Hayes Valley neighborhood (and just a block away from Davies Symphony Hall). Mr. Cavagnero began drawing up designs.But the idea of a purpose-built structure wasn’t necessarily an easy sell with the SFJazz board: as some members pointed out, the organization had flourished for years without it. One thing that helped Mr. Kline’s cause was the focus and passion of his argument about permanence; another was a lead gift of $20 million, which he had secured from an anonymous benefactor.One core principle for the new building, through many rounds of planning, was that it would be a community center as much as a concert hall. To that end, the glass exterior conveys a literal and conceptual transparency, while the second-floor lobby is bracketed by bars and balconies. (A pair of commissioned murals depicting jazz scenes, by the artists Sandow Birk and Elyse Pignolet, adorn the lobby walls.) The Joe Henderson Lab, a secondary 80-seat performance space that will accommodate workshops and other gatherings, sits at ground level, its goings-on visible to passers-by.And while a street-level cafe called South at SFJazz won’t open for business until next month, it will be run by Charles Phan, the influential chef and owner of the Slanted Door restaurant group. It will be open all day, serving customers who aren’t SFJazz patrons, which Mr. Kline said was the point.As for the feel of the auditorium, Mr. Cavagnero said, “I started looking at these Unitarian churches, because they’re places that are about people meeting, and there is no formal power relationship; it’s about everyone being equal.”He said he drew particular inspiration from Frank Lloyd Wright’s Unity Temple and Louis Kahn’s First Unitarian Church, adopting similar proportions for the hall. Its steeply raked seating plan offers good sightlines, and even a sense of intimacy, from just about every vantage. (One row of balcony seats, which peers down from behind the stage, is likely to become a prized perch for music students looking to get inside the action.)Mr. Kline, whose own set of references included a range of nonsacramental spaces like the Brooklyn Lyceum and the Fat Cat in Greenwich Village, put it this way: “We wanted the focused feeling of a concert hall but the relaxed proximity of a club.”The sound in the cubelike auditorium, which was designed with input from the theater consultant Len Auerbach and the acoustician Sam Berkow, runs toward the drier end of the spectrum: generally better for jazz than the reverberant standard of a classical hall, which can drown a group in cymbal wash. Wooden slats running along the walls disperse sound while adding a low-key visual flair.It will take a little while for sound technicians to get to know the room; during Wednesday’s concert, which featured an honor roll of musicians with established ties to SFJazz, there were some inconsistencies. But the natural drum sound was a winner: Jeff Ballard came across crisply behind Mr. Redman and the tenor saxophonist Joe Lovano on “Blackwell’s Message,” a tune by Mr. Lovano. And there was a pristine hush in the air during a first-time duet by the pianist Chick Corea and the guitarist Bill Frisell.Wednesday was the kickoff for an opening-week festival that also featured concerts by Mr. Tyner, Mr. Hutcherson, the SFJazz Collective and the organization’s five resident artistic directors this season: Mr. Frisell, the violinist Regina Carter, the pianist Jason Moran, the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón and the percussionist John Santos.The programming — not just this week but throughout a 30th-anniversary season that will feature multi-night appearances by the pianist Brad Mehldau, the fado singer Ana Moura, the tabla player Zakir Hussain and the banjoist Béla Fleck — speaks to an inherent curiosity in the SFJazz psyche, an eagerness to tease out unlikely connections. (One immediately talked-about component of Mr. Moran’s residency, in May, will be an improvised collaboration with local skateboarders.)And to the extent that the SFJazz Center has enabled that breadth of style and approach, it disarms the very comparisons it invites. Jazz at Lincoln Center, taking its cue from Wynton Marsalis, its artistic director, has always used its programming to express a firm conviction about what jazz is (and by strong implication, what it isn’t — or what isn’t it). Mr. Kline and his team aren’t naturally inclined toward that definitive sort of mission, and it’s fortunate that they don’t have to be.A permanent home is a sign of hard-fought maturity; it demands that an organization be understood on its own terms. That will increasingly be the case for SFJazz — and yet the bicoastal symmetry has its uses, at least for now.“Jazz at Lincoln Center has been incredibly successful,” said Mr. Redman, “and if SFJazz can be successful, maybe one of the legacies will be that in the foreseeable future, they won’t be the only two. There’ll be other venues, other buildings for jazz that can enter the discussion. I think that would be fantastic.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/movies/how-the-seven-per-cent-solution-reinvented-sherlock-holmes.html,"We’re lousy with Sherlock Holmeses right now: the Robert Downey Jr. version on the big screen, the competing television interpretations of Benedict Cumberbatch (“Sherlock”) and Jonny Lee Miller (“Elementary”) and all the Holmes-inspired geniuses in current and recent TV shows like “The Mentalist,” “Psych,” “House” and “Monk.” So “The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,” released this week in a new Blu-ray and DVD package, enters a crowded market.But its Sherlock deserves special consideration because he’s the father of all those modern Holmeses. Besides being a clever comic mystery with an absurdly talented cast, this 1976 film — based on Nicholas Meyer’s playful novel imagining the meeting of two great Victorian detectives, one of whom is Sigmund Freud — established the template for all the twitchy, paranoid, vulnerable, strung-out Holmeses to come.It may be hard to countenance now, but for much of the 20th century there was just one Sherlock Holmes on screen: the hawk-nosed British actor Basil Rathbone, whose Shakespearean elocution and commanding physical presence defined the English-speaking world’s most famous detective in 14 movies in the 1930s and ’40s.The Rathbone Holmes, familiar to generations of late-night TV viewers, could be energetic and impetuous, but he was decidedly rational, and his behavior was always in bounds — there was not much evidence of the Bohemianism and eccentricity the character exhibited in Arthur Conan Doyle’s original stories. Humor in the films was supplied by Nigel Bruce’s clueless Doctor Watson, a lovable buffoon who was always bewildered by the case at hand.In his novel and his screenplay, Mr. Meyer reacted against the Rathbone films’ ossified notions of Holmes and Watson, giving the story a postmodern spin while in some ways returning the characters to their Conan Doyle roots. “ ‘The Seven-Per-Cent Solution’ is not a Sherlock Holmes movie,” he says in an interview included with the new release (Shout! Factory, two discs, $26.99). “It’s a movie about Sherlock Holmes. That’s different.”The main difference, of course, was Mr. Meyer’s inspired idea of having the fictional Holmes (Nicol Williamson) work on a case with Freud (Alan Arkin), an encounter that takes place in the chronologically plausible year of 1891. To bring about their meeting, Mr. Meyer took a detail from Holmes’s background — his habitual use of cocaine, legally available in Victorian England — and made it the engine of the story, having Watson transport the hallucinating Holmes to Vienna in the hope that Freud, a fellow user, can work a cure.It was that decision that propelled Holmes into the modern world, making him the model for today’s variously troubled Sherlocks, as well as an early example of the recovery-story hero. Williamson carried out this radical refashioning in a performance that was simultaneously manic and starched, marvelously comic but rooted in real pain.“This is a movie about the inside of this man’s character and how he got to be who and what he is,” Mr. Meyer says in the interview. “You’re not meeting Holmes in a normal, high-functioning, operational mode.”His intuition that a flawed Holmes would have comic appeal is signaled in a line barked by Freud, when the psychiatrist and the detective argue over who is to blame for a bad turn in the case: “What is this egocentric streak of melodrama that does not allow anyone to share in your triumphs or disasters?”Tracing the history of the detective as hero is not the only reason to watch “The Seven-Per-Cent Solution,” which holds up quite well as entertainment; as directed by Herbert Ross, it’s a deft and unusual mix of light comedy and globe-trotting caper. It supplies the expected satisfactions of instantaneous deduction, cultured repartee between Holmes and Freud and allusions to Conan Doyle’s work, as well as a long and exhilarating chase across the European countryside involving real steam locomotives.Mr. Meyer’s story, which would now be called meta, is couched as an alternate explanation for the period between Holmes’s supposed death at the hands of James Moriarty (recounted in Conan Doyle’s “Final Problem”) and his resurrection (in “The Adventure of the Empty House”). The hiatus that begins with Holmes’s drying out extends into a case involving a pasha, a baron and a redheaded temptress, during which Holmes instructs Freud in the mechanics of detection and gives him some ideas about the meaning of dreams.The redhead is played by Vanessa Redgrave, one of the adornments of a supporting cast that includes Laurence Olivier as a drolly timorous Moriarty and, most surprisingly, Robert Duvall as a steadfast, levelheaded Watson, written by Mr. Meyer in conscious rebellion against the Nigel Bruce portrayal.By the end of “The Seven-Per-Cent Solution” Mr. Meyer’s Holmes has diverged from his descendants in one important way: having done time with Freud and saved Europe from war, he is well adjusted and ready to face the world. For the current crop of Holmeses, dependent on future TV seasons or movie sequels, that kind of recovery is a nonstarter."

At the same time, new infections with influenza continued to fall, suggesting that the season has peaked almost everywhere in the country except in the far West. Because so many of those hospitalized and dying from the flu are geriatric patients, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued guidelines to doctors who care for older patients, suggesting giving high-dose flu shots to the elderly and starting antiflu drugs as soon as an infection is suspected."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/arts/music/lorin-maazel-and-new-york-philharmonic-at-avery-fisher-hall.html,"At 82, Lorin Maazel remains one of the most prodigiously skilled and experienced conductors in the business. Yet during his seven-year tenure as music director of the New York Philharmonic, which ended with the 2008-9 season, he sometimes seemed curiously disengaged, especially toward the end.That was certainly the impression he gave on Thursday night at Avery Fisher Hall for the second of two programs in a return to the Philharmonic’s podium. There was one outstanding performance: the brilliant violinist Jennifer Koh made an auspicious debut on a Philharmonic subscription series program as soloist in Lutoslawski’s “Chain 2: Dialogue for Violin and Orchestra.” Mr. Maazel has always been excellent in contemporary music, where he responds to the challenges of guiding an orchestra through a complex modern score.But in two standard repertory works, Tchaikovsky’s overture-fantasy “Romeo and Juliet,” which opened the program, and Shostakovich’s formidable Fifth Symphony, which ended it, the playing of the orchestra under Mr. Maazel was often reined in and often listless.I may have been harder to please than many other audience members on Thursday night, since I had just heard Yannick Nézet-Séguin conduct the Philadelphia Orchestra in a stunning account of Shostakovich’s Fifth a week earlier at Carnegie Hall. This fall the charismatic Mr. Nézet-Séguin, 37, became the music director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, and though his schedule for his first season is limited, he has galvanized that great ensemble.The Philharmonic players seemed anything but galvanized on Thursday during the Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich works. Mr. Maazel has said that he has no patience with the sentimental and exaggeratedly Romantic interpretations that he often hears. And I am all for bringing out the ingenious craft and intelligence of Tchaikovsky’s music. But in ridding “Romeo and Juliet” of sentimentality, Mr. Maazel also robbed it of passion in this weighty, stolid performance.In the first movement of the Shostakovich, he seemed to be going for dramatic understatement. He brought a steady tread and exacting execution to the grave opening. During the episode in which the music breaks into militaristic intensity, the Philharmonic played with steely power that shook the hall yet never turned harsh. Still, the effect was calculated. The Largo movement, filled with stretches of quiet anguish, was particularly tepid, though the string sound was often beautiful, especially an eerie moment when the second violins played a sustained, shimmering high tremolo that seemed to be coming into the hall from some far-off place.Lutoslawski’s 20-minute, four-movement “Chain 2,” completed in 1985, is a pivotal work in that composer’s exploration of two techniques. One involves making linear and melodic phrases seamlessly overlap, rather than letting them unfold like sentences in a musical paragraph; the other touches on Lutoslawski’s experiments with introducing elements of chance into his composition. In this work, during sections headed “Ad libitum,” some musical materials are to be played with free rhythm and in an improvisatory manner, though, as Lutoslawski explained, within fixed parameters.In a way, none of this has to matter to the listener. At least in a performance as arresting as this one, “Chain 2” comes across as the urgent dialogue for violin and orchestra that Lutoslawski called it. Playing with penetrating sound, myriad colorings and commanding technique, Ms. Koh conveyed the shifting twists of this episodic piece, from its discursive lyrical stretches to its skittish outbursts.In the orchestral writing there are hints of the composers who influenced Lutoslawski, especially Stravinsky, Bartok and Varèse. Mr. Maazel made those connections vibrant in the bold performance he drew from the Philharmonic.If only he had been as engaged in the staples."

That is not the expected outcome, Cashman said.“I was asked if it is possible, and I said, ‘Yeah, it’s possible,’ ” Cashman said later Friday. “It’s a complicated surgery, and anything is possible. It’s not the likely outcome. It’s not what the doctors expect.”Rodriguez had surgery on his left hip on Jan. 16 to repair a torn labrum and to reshape the femoral head of his thigh bone, which fits into the socket."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/arts/music/lola-astanova-with-the-orchestra-of-st-lukes.html,"Performing Tchaikovsky’s Piano Concerto No. 1 and Rachmaninoff’s Piano Concerto No. 2 on the same evening requires athletic stamina. But if a pianist lacks the muscle to complete the race, it becomes an endurance test for both soloist and listeners.When Lola Astanova joined the Orchestra of St. Luke’s on Wednesday at Alice Tully Hall, her playing often sounded labored and muted, lacking the power and rich sound that are essential components of a successful rendition of these tumultuous Romantic works.Ms. Astanova, a glamorous, fashionable musician who gave a star-studded benefit concert at Carnegie Hall last year, did not prove herself here to be of the same caliber as the outstanding soloists that this excellent orchestra often performs with. She and Jahja Ling, who conducted this event, have collaborated on both concertos on previous occasions.Ms. Astanova also failed to imbue the slow movements of either the Tchaikovsky, performed in the first half of the program, or the Rachmaninoff, played after intermission, with any sense of lyricism. Her phrasing often sounded rather choppy; her playing dispassionate. Mr. Ling elicited a rich sound from the strings, although the orchestra didn’t sound particularly excited about the collaboration.But there was no lack of passion in the bristling performance of the overture to Franz von Suppé’s operetta “Light Cavalry,” which opened the concert on a dynamic note. Suppé wrote dozens of operettas, now seldom performed, although the overtures have remained in the repertory. Brass fanfares, played here with panache, open the work on a militaristic note. The ensuing agitated outpouring unfolded with crisp attack in the violins, and the strings imbued the wistful middle section with soulful depth.The vivid interpretation of three dances from Smetana’s “Bartered Bride,” a comic opera that reflects the composer’s interest in traditional Bohemian dance forms and folk idioms, was equally rewarding. Mr. Ling led a beautifully shaded and detailed performance that fully conveyed the exuberant character of the work."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/business/johnson-johnson-hid-flaw-in-artificial-hip-documents-show.html,"Johnson & Johnson executives knew years before they recalled a troubled artificial hip in 2010 that it had a critical design flaw, but the company concealed that information from physicians and patients, according to internal documents disclosed on Friday during a trial related to the device’s failure.The company had received complaints from doctors about the device, the Articular Surface Replacement, or A.S.R., even as it started marketing a version of it in the United States in 2005. The A.S.R.’s flaw caused it to shed large quantities of metallic debris after implantation, and the model failed an internal test in 2007 in which engineers compared its performance to that of another of the company’s hip implants, the documents show.Still, executives in Johnson & Johnson’s DePuy Orthopaedics unit kept selling the A.S.R. even as it was being abandoned by surgeons who worked as consultants to the company. DePuy executives discussed ways of fixing the defect, the records suggest, but they apparently never did so.Plaintiffs’ lawyers introduced the documents on Friday in Los Angeles Superior Court during opening arguments in the first A.S.R.-related lawsuit to go to trial. The company faces more than 10,000 lawsuits in the United States in connection with the device. An estimated 93,000 patients worldwide received an A.S.R., about one-third of them in the United States.DePuy executives insisted before the A.S.R.’s recall in mid-2010 that the implant was working well, despite years of complaints from doctors that it was failing early. In late 2009, the company announced plans to phase out the model but said it was doing so because of slowing sales, not safety concerns.In opening arguments — followed remotely over the Courtroom View Network — a lawyer for DePuy, Alexander G. Calfo, reiterated those positions, telling jurors that DePuy had behaved ethically throughout the A.S.R. episode.“The evidence will show that DePuy acted as an extremely responsible manufacturer,” Mr. Calfo said.But a lawyer for Loren Kransky, the plaintiff in the case, painted a far different picture of DePuy’s behavior for jurors in his opening arguments.The lawyer, Michael A. Kelly, also introduced a number of internal records that suggested that company executives’ concern for profits might have exceeded their worries about patients. For example, Mr. Kelly said, DePuy officials never told doctors that the A.S.R. had failed an internal performance test against another company hip.“They did not report the data to American doctors,” Mr. Kelly said. “They changed the test and tested it against other things until they found one it could beat.”The A.S.R. represents one of the biggest medical device failures in recent decades. According to DePuy’s internal estimates, it is projected to fail within five years in about 40 percent of patients who received one. That is eight times the failure rate of most orthopedic implants.The A.S.R. belonged to a once-popular class of hip implants introduced about a decade ago in an attempt to address problems associated with hips made from traditional materials like metal and plastic. But surgeons have largely abandoned devices in that class because their components can grind together, releasing metallic debris that damages a patient’s tissue and bone.DePuy sold two versions of the A.S.R., one used in an alternative hip replacement called resurfacing and one used in standard hip replacement. Only the version used in standard replacements was sold in the United States.In 2003, DePuy began selling the resurfacing version of the A.S.R. outside the United States in an effort to catch up with a competing device known as the Birmingham hip. But by 2005, some doctors had begun telling DePuy that the A.S.R. was failing quickly after implantation, and company consultants soon stopped using it, records show.The problem, internal DePuy records indicate, was the design of the cup component that fit into a patient’s hip socket. The cup, which was used in both the resurfacing and the standard versions of the A.S.R., had an inside groove against which a surgeon pressed a tool to implant the component.The design was flawed because the groove limited the surface area inside the cup in which the device’s ball could rotate as a patient moved. As a result, the ball was more likely to strike the cup’s edge, causing wear and generating metallic debris.In 2007, DePuy engineers tested the A.S.R.’s rate of wear to see if it matched the wear rate of another all-metal hip implant made by the company. It did not.“The current results for A.S.R. do not meet the set acceptance criteria for this test,” that report stated.The same year, company officials began discussing ways to fix the problem, like redesigning the cup to eliminate the groove. But at the same time, it was actively marketing the A.S.R. to surgeons in the United States, who were implanting it into tens of thousands of patients.“We will ultimately need a cup redesign, but the short-term action is manage perceptions,” one top DePuy sales official told a colleague in a 2008 e-mail. A DePuy executive, Andrew Ekdahl, who is now the unit’s president, was also told by a company consultant that the A.S.R. was flawed, according to another document.In mid-2008, DePuy apparently abandoned the redesign project, an internal document indicates. A company spokeswoman, Mindy Tinsley, declined to comment on the document.In the fall of 2009, the Food and Drug Administration rejected DePuy’s application to sell the resurfacing version of the A.S.R. in the United States, saying it was concerned about, among other things, “high concentration of metal ions” in the blood of patients who received it.DePuy executives soon started making financial estimates of when the company should stop selling the A.S.R., based on the time it would take to convert surgeons to another company implant, a document shows.Before the Los Angeles trial began on Friday, DePuy had settled a few other A.S.R. lawsuits.The plaintiff in the current case, Mr. Kransky, a former corrections official, is dying of cancer unrelated to his hip implant. He also has a number of unrelated illnesses."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/movies/breaking-into-movies-via-mixed-martial-arts.html,"In the fall of 2006 Ken Chamitoff was traveling around the United States for his company, which takes photographs at martial arts studios. In Bellingham, Wash., about halfway through a three-and-a-half-month stint on the road, the unending days of being away from his family and living in hotel rooms got to him.“I went a little nuts,” he said, and embarked on a shopping spree for martial arts movies, watching them over the next four or five days. “Afterwards I called my wife and said, ‘I’m going to make one.’ By Christmas I had the first draft of a script done.”The script, “Art of Submission,” sought to combine the virtues of traditional kung fu cinema with the street-savvy sensibilities of mixed martial arts, or M.M.A., as it’s widely known. At the time the sport was exploding. A decade earlier Senator John McCain had derided it as “human cockfighting,” but by 2006 it was a bigger television draw than boxing. In 2008 the sport’s premier governing body, Ultimate Fighting Championship, known as the U.F.C., was valued at more than $1 billion.Today “Art of Submission,” which had its theatrical debut in San Jose, Calif., in September, is part of the growing subgenre of what might be called fightsploitation films. Occasionally marketed in conjunction with mixed martial arts events and frequently turning a modest profit, these movies usually rely on the same ingredients: an underdog protagonist navigating a world of underground fight clubs, prison or professional mixed martial arts; a cast that features the sport’s stars alongside journeyman actors; plenty of scantily clad (or occasionally unclad) young women; and at least one scene involving high-performance sports cars. As Stan Wertlieb, a partner in the Grindstone Entertainment Group, responsible for several fightsploitation releases, put it: “It’s movies targeted at guys. We tried to capture the same audience M.M.A. were so successful with.”Mr. Chamitoff initially planned to spend $50,000 and film near his Palmdale, Calif., home. But as he traveled for his company, martial arts school owners expressed interest in investing in “Art of Submission.” The first chipped in $20,000, and as similar checks followed, mostly from school owners, instructors or students, the budget grew to $4.5 million, and the project’s scope changed, said Mr. Chamitoff, who would eventually direct the film with Adam Boster.The bigger budget meant being able to hire some recognizable actors, notably Ving Rhames and John Savage, as well as professional fighters like Frank Shamrock, a mixed martial arts star for more than a decade, and Gray Maynard, a contestant on Season 5 of the hit U.F.C. reality show “The Ultimate Fighter.”As the production proceeded in fits and starts over more than four years the film industry was simultaneously taking note of mixed martial arts’ growth. What began as a slow trickle of fightsploitation movies became a steady flow by 2009 with titles like “Blood and Bone,” “Hell’s Chain” and “Never Surrender.” Grindstone, which specializes in low-to-mid-budget action films and thrillers, and has a distribution deal through Lionsgate, released six mixed martial arts films in 2009 and 2010.“We saw the opportunity to catch the wave,” said Barry Brooker, Grindstone’s president. “U.F.C. as a brand was growing. Not only was it working domestically, but in the rest of the world M.M.A. was catching on.”Hector Echavarria, a former champion kickboxer and martial artist, has been a central figure in fightsploitation since its inception. He appeared in two of the earliest movies to feature mixed martial arts fighters, “Cradle 2 the Grave” (2003) and “Confessions of a Pit Fighter” (2005). In 2009 he wrote, directed and starred in “Never Surrender,” Grindstone’s first fightsploitation venture, and cast several of the sport’s stars, including Quinton Jackson a k a Rampage, and Georges St.-Pierre. Since then Mr. Echavarria has been the creative force behind four more titles, with another four in various stages of production.“I thought M.M.A. was going to be huge, so I started using fighters in the movies,” he said. “When they weren’t great actors, we’d just give them good fighting sequences.”In Mr. Shamrock’s view, mixed martial arts is actually good training for acting.“M.M.A. is about preparing for a moment, getting on the big stage and shining or crashing and burning,” he said. “The discipline necessary is the same discipline needed to learn lines, study inflections, understand characters and dig deeply into a script. I may have been one of the best actors in M.M.A., because I convinced the whole world I was a mean S.O.B. but really never wanted to hurt anybody.”Fightsploitation generally works within certain creative confines. As Daniel Zirilli, who wrote and directed two Grindstone releases, “Circle of Pain” and “Locked Down,” explained, his films were products made according to a strict formula: shot in 13 to 15 days on budgets of less than $1 million. “I liked ‘Locked Down,’ but a prison fight movie is only going to be so great,” he added. “ ‘Circle of Pain,’ there’s a good family story line. However, that was cut substantially. It was like: ‘Cut it. Get straight to the action.’ ”A few fighters have graduated to mainstream films, including Mr. Jackson, who starred in “The A-Team” in 2010, and Randy Couture, who co-starred in both installments of “The Expendables.” But so far most fightsploitation films have been aimed not at multiplexes but at the straight-to-DVD, video-on-demand and pay-per-view markets. Nonetheless, when these films are tightly budgeted, the popularity of the mixed martial arts stars alone practically guarantees a modest profit.The holy grail now is a full-fledged theatrical hit, though recent history suggests that fightsploitation may have hit a commercial ceiling. David Mamet’s 2008 film, “Redbelt,” was in and out of theaters before anyone noticed. “Warrior,” the 2011 film starring Tom Hardy and Joel Edgerton that is considered fightsploitation’s “Rocky,” was also a box office disappointment, earning only $23 million worldwide on a reported $25 million budget. Kevin James’s recent comedy, “Here Comes the Boom,” has done marginally better but is really a film that happens to include mixed martial arts rather than genuine fightsploitation.Mr. Chamitoff’s goal was always theaters, and to accomplish that he’s employing a novel grass-roots release strategy that involves staging mixed martial arts bouts around the country. At each fight clips from the film are shown, and most are followed with a screening that week at a local theater. The first event in September drew 800 people, and nearly double that turned out for the second one in October.The fights are being filmed and edited into hourlong television programs — complete with commercials for the film — that will be broadcast to a potential audience of 88 million viewers as part of a deal with cable and satellite TV providers including AT&T U-Verse, Comcast and DirecTV. Mr. Chamitoff’s plan is to generate enough money and buzz to leverage the film into wider release. He said “Art of Submission” — which follows fightsploitation’s basic creative template but without what he sees as the more exploitive “blood and porn” aspects — has a chance to spread the gospel of mixed martial arts’ more noble virtues.“Whatever time it takes between now and the wide theatrical release, I’m not in a rush,” he said. “My whole philosophy is: Let testosterone bring them in, then I’m going to send them out with a message.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/arts/music/new-cds-from-follakzoid-dawn-richard-and-aruan-ortiz.html,"FöllakzoidChilean psych-rockA few years ago a new psychedelic-rock scene emerged in Santiago, Chile, for the second time. Chile once had some great psychedelic- and progressive-rock bands, including Los Jaivas, Aguaturbia and Los Blops, before the military regime drove youth culture underground in 1973. A Santiago label, Blow Your Mind Records, has been sponsoring a return of that aesthetic, and if the acts on the label can be described in general terms, it’s pre-Pinochet hippie universality, plus the early-’70s long-form, motor-rhythm rock of the German bands Can and Neu, plus the ragged stomp and furtive pop instincts of the ’90s American band the Brian Jonestown Massacre. Always there’s a centering drone. It’s earnest and backward looking, this music, but vigorous; there is something special going on here.The American label Sacred Bones is releasing new music by two of Blow Your Mind’s bands: Holydrug Couple, a duo, and Föllakzoid, a quartet that builds danceable songs, either slow or brisk, out of long jams, with layers of echo, gathering washes of phase and rumble, and hazy, indistinct singing. Föllakzoid’s new album, “II,” is a winner. As songs like “99,” “Trees” and “Pulsar” unfold and gradually develop, they quickly force you to listen from a distance, to grasp the whole thing rather than its particulars.Jessika Kenney and Eyvind KangA Persian-Javanese updatingThe singer Jessika Kenney and the violist Eyvind Kang, a married couple in Seattle, seem to appear where vanguardism, sacred texts and improvised music come together in the Northwest. They have a continuing project of writing new settings for old Persian and Javanese music, and “The Face of the Earth” (Ideologic Organ) is their latest installment, a gorgeous record. One track is a prayer that Ms. Kenney sings in her clear, settled mezzo-soprano against a slow plucked string pattern; one is a strummed viola drone; one is a wordless long-tone song; one is multitracked polyrhythmic vocal and string patterns. On the vinyl release — recommended for this album’s depth — Side 1 sounds antiquarian and Side 2 experimental. But you may have a hard time deciding which side is more personal to the makers. It’s serious, refined music.Dawn RichardOddball R&BIn parallel to the protean aesthetic development of hip-hop, R&B has often seemed like the live-performance engine of black pop, in which the traditional and normative notions of talent and ambition were being served. But record industry money maintained those norms, and as more R&B artists develop themselves outside major-label budgets, they’re establishing their own. Yes, Frank Ocean, Miguel, the Weeknd, but also Dawn Richard, she of Diddy’s circle and the mid-oughts, all-female R&B vocal group Danity Kane, who is now releasing music without a label. It’s pretty weird. Last year she hooked up with the producer and songwriter Druski, and the results — songs collected on the late-2012 EPs “Armor On” and “Whiteout,” and now the full-length “Goldenheart” (Altavoz) — have been slow and messy and atmospheric, full of contemporary R&B’s customary ingredients (virtual strings, AutoTune, gold-plated emotion) but stretched out, heavy on atmosphere, light on hooks. “Goldenheart” is at times mawkish, plodding, self-obsessed, gothy, campy, filmic; it contains a two-step ambient version of Peter Gabriel’s “In Your Eyes.” Is it good? I don’t know about that. But it has the dissonant attraction of something ventured. And it’s confident enough to sound normal.Aruán OrtizA versatile Cuban-born pianistKeep an eye this year on Arúan Ortiz, a Cuban-born New York pianist who’s become a mark of quality on gigs and records, though you might miss half his work if you don’t listen broadly. Within the past year he has led a quartet on “Orbiting” (Fresh Sound), a flexible studio record of originals and standards, and appeared on “Banned in London” (Whirlwind) in a quintet he leads with the London bassist Michael Janisch. (It includes the alto saxophonist Greg Osby, the trumpeter Raynald Colom and the drummer Rudy Royston.) Both of those records are new jazz as we know it, the second one more versatile. But he also made “Santiarican Blues Suite” (Sunnyside), a meticulous classical piece for chamber orchestra, drummers and voices, written to honor the history of Afro-Haitian dance. And most recently there has been “Textures and Pulsations” (Ictus), a collaboration with Bob Gluck, a pianist and electronic musician of similarly diverse interests, partly improvised electroacoustic duets and partly two grand pianos virtuosically locking together on short, argumentative themes."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/arts/television/the-americans-with-keri-russell-as-a-kgb-agent.html,"“The Americans,” a new spy thriller starting Wednesday on FX, has a C.I.A. pedigree, is set in the geopolitical crucible of the cold war 1980s and stars Keri Russell playing against winsome type as a Communist hard-liner who is equally adept at seducing bureaucrats, kicking the heads of her enemies through walls or inserting a bit of propaganda into her son’s homework.It has plenty going for it as a cloak-and-dagger series, in other words, especially in a prime-time era defined by another espionage drama, “Homeland.”But it’s the metaphorical tension of the show’s domestic conceit — a pair of deep-cover K.G.B. agents are assigned to pose as husband and wife in the Washington suburbs — that the show’s creators hope will elevate it into something more than a pulpy diversion. The bet is that beyond the clandestine window dressing, viewers may find some deeper resonance in the story of two people thrown together by fate, who end up years later with two kids, a house in the ’burbs and a superficial marriage that they keep up for appearance’s sake.“Regardless of whether you’re spies, how much do you really know somebody?” said Ms. Russell, perhaps best known as the title ingénue in “Felicity,” which was shown on WB from 1998 to 2002. “How much do you really choose somebody?”Or as Joel Fields, an executive producer, put it, “What is marriage besides going through the motions?”“The Americans” was inspired by the 2010 arrest of a ring of actual Russian sleeper agents. The case, with its forged passports, coded messages and other details seemingly derived from a John le Carré novel, spurred Amblin Entertainment to contact Joe Weisberg, who was a case officer trainee at the C.I.A. in the 1990s before moving on to write for series like “Damages” and “Falling Skies.” The show he came up with moved the spy story to the 1980s and drew on his recollections of how working undercover affected the family lives of operatives he met at the agency.“Even in this show, which has a lot of fun with espionage, there were stories we could tell that could feel real,” Mr. Weisberg said. (Just not too real. As part of his C.I.A. nondisclosure agreement Mr. Weisberg must submit his scripts to the agency for approval.)“The Americans” begins in 1981, more than a decade after the show’s spies, played by Ms. Russell and Matthew Rhys, emigrated to the United States, had children and established a modest travel agency — all part of the cover — in Falls Church, Va. (The show is actually shot in and around New York City.) The election of Ronald Reagan, with his “Evil Empire” rhetoric, as president has intensified the hostility between the superpowers. Meanwhile the couple has come to a sort of emotional crossroads, torn between a long-standing loyalty to the motherland and devotion to their American family. Existentially charged high jinks ensue as the agents, known as Phillip and Elizabeth Jennings, negotiate both their own deepening relationship and a series of increasingly dangerous operations.The period details are relatively muted, aside from a soundtrack that features Pat Benatar, Juice Newton and the requisite “In the Air Tonight” by Phil Collins. “We tried to find a way of being true to the period without being slaves to it,” said Adam Arkin, a producing director for the series.But the time frame does allow the show to borrow actual historical tension and off-screen characters while spinning a yarn free of smartphones or online technology. When the agents bug the office of Secretary of Defense Caspar W. Weinberger, they use an analog microphone and a remote transmitter the size of shoe box.“It makes for better television because you’re not just looking at a computer screen,” said Mr. Rhys, a native of Cardiff, Wales.Ms. Russell added, “We have to drive by our drop spot — like, we’re looking under rocks for messages.”Often at odds within the series, the actors share an obvious rapport in person. Interviewed together in Ms. Russell’s trailer on the set in Gowanus, Brooklyn, they traded jokes about the series (Mr. Rhys: “I think she kills me in Episode 8.” Ms. Russell: “Then it’s just going to be called ‘The American.’ ”) along with more earnest musings about the challenges of creating a credible phony-but-maybe-becoming-real marriage while also occasionally beating people up.Ms. Russell’s trial by fire came in the pilot, she said, when her character was required to kick the head of a rival agent through a wall. The rattled actress was ultimately intimidated into action by a pep talk of sorts from David Vadim, the actor preparing to receive the blow.“He was putting in his mouth guard and he said, ‘Listen, do it right once, otherwise I’m going to be mad if we have to do it again,’ ” she said.Ms. Russell, who played vulnerable charmers in films like “Waitress,” acknowledged that subverting this reputation was “what was interesting” about taking on a K.G.B. agent.She was chosen by John Landgraf, the president of FX, a longtime admirer. He considered her hiring to be in line with the network’s tradition of surprising casting, which has revealed the grittier capabilities of Michael Chiklis in “The Shield,” Ted Danson in “Damages” and Katey Sagal in “Sons of Anarchy.”“I wanted to see Felicity’s dark side,” he said.A cynic might presume that Mr. Landgraf also wanted a spy drama on his schedule after the success of Showtime’s “Homeland,” suspecting that “The Americans” might represent the leading edge of a post-“Homeland” proliferation of covert thrillers.However, FX picked up “The Americans” before “Homeland” made its debut, Mr. Landgraf said.The producers draw a closer comparison with “The Sopranos,” which is perhaps not surprising. Who wouldn’t want to keep company with one of the most acclaimed shows in history? But the point, Mr. Fields said, is “you were drawn into this intense family drama that happened to be set in a very challenging world, and the same is the case here, we hope.”Occasionally the two sides overlap. In the premiere episode Mr. Rhys’s character dons one of his spy disguises before hunting down and throttling a brute who ogled his teenage daughter at the mall. While helping her son with a school project about American Moon landings, Ms. Russell’s Elizabeth notes, a tad defensively, that “the Moon isn’t everything, just getting into space is a remarkable accomplishment.”But these and other comic grace notes — like the juxtaposition of Ms. Russell plotting darkly while wearing Guess mom jeans and other ’80s ’burbwear — are exceptions to a generally taut, morally ambiguous tone that owes more to claustrophobic espionage tales like “Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy” than “Mr. & Mrs. Smith.” The couple chase targets through noirish city streets, sure, but they’re also visibly tormented after poisoning an innocent pawn.Not even the subdivision is safe when a F.B.I. counterintelligence agent, played by the veteran character actor Noah Emmerich, moves in across the street. Mr. Emmerich was drawn to his first television series by questions it raises about patriotism and “enemy” cultures, as reflected by its “ambiguity about who you’re supposed to be rooting for,” he said in his trailer.Coincidentally Mr. Emmerich was preparing to film a scene set on the day that John Hinckley Jr. tried to assassinate Reagan — an event that helped jump-start the modern gun-control movement through the wounding of James Brady — on the same afternoon that Wayne LaPierre, chief executive of the National Rifle Association, was speaking in Washington to discourage new gun regulations after the shooting in Newtown, Conn. “Sometimes the lens of history can give you a little distance and perspective,” Mr. Emmerich said, “to explore historical issues that are actually completely contemporary.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/fashion/chloe-grace-moretz-what-i-wore.html,"BORN IN ATLANTA but raised in Los Angeles, where she currently lives, Chloë Grace Moretz, who turns 16 next month, started acting a decade ago. She has several films coming out this year, including “Movie 43” this month, “Kick-Ass 2” in June and “Carrie” in October. Ms. Moretz was in Paris last week during the spring 2013 couture shows.MONDAY, JAN. 21I was staying at the Plaza Athénée — it’s just gorgeous. After walking around a lot the last few days, I had a lazy morning and wore just black yoga pants and a white T-shirt, kind of slouchy. Finally, I did get dressed for eggs Benedict downstairs and put on black fitted jeans from Aéropostale (I’m a brand ambassador there) that I rolled up to the ankles and a white, black and blue button-down shirt from Topshop. My shoes were black Burberry wedges with gripping soles that were pretty much made for the snow.I went back upstairs around noon, and did the whole hair and makeup thing to go to the Dior couture show. It’s my first couture show and I’m wearing the brand new pre-fall collection, but I didn’t want to go too old. I always try to think age-appropriate and all that, and I had just dyed my blond hair a darker color, which changes how you look in things, for the fun of it. I wore this navy zip-coat that had a rocker feel and an amazing high-waisted skirt: It had gathered fabric, but didn’t make you look pudgy. And I had on these pointy heels.With my stylist, we’ll look at runway collections for events — I always have my eye on Style.com — and we usually start planning outfits a couple months in advance. So for “Kick-Ass,” we’ll start in April, because sometimes you’ll have press days where you’re changing six times a day. For the “Movie 43” premiere in L.A. this week, we’ve had a Dolce & Gabbana black tuxedo jacket and high-waisted pants with a white shirt picked out weeks ago. And it’s just madness in L.A. between the Globes and the Oscars. I’ll be going to a couple events, because that’s part of the job, but I don’t really love after-parties. I’m 15; there’s not a lot to do.If I’m going to be on the red carpet, though, I tend to go for it. Why not? It’s about being glam and all that. In my daily clothes, I’ll mix it up more. It might be tomboy or kind of rugged, but I’ll always have one piece that looks put together. I noticed in Paris pieces are more structured and polished. It’s completely different from L.A. where the look is like you just rolled out of bed, which I don’t love. But British fashion is my favorite, not the really put together Brit, but more the broken-down kind of look: Alexa Chung mixed with Grace Kelly. I like to go back and look at the classics too. I’m in love with the ’40s and the ’60s, and I even love the ’70s and ’90s, but I could probably skip the ’80s.Anyway, of course, the minute I left the Dior show, I kicked off my heels and put on these Prada brogues to hang out in. They were black and they weren’t too boyish and had a funky wide bottom. And they were comfortable enough that I kept them on into dinner."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/arts/television/brett-butler-on-charlie-sheens-anger-management.html,"SUN VALLEY, CALIF. — She walked back and forth across a parking lot behind a converted-warehouse soundstage here on the industrial fringes of the San Fernando Valley. Brett Butler was smoking a cigar, her hair in curlers, practicing her lines — of which there were not many — over and over again.“You may not know this because you’re” an idiot, she said, in character as she paced. “But women who base their self-esteem on their looks are usually pretty insecure.”She only had one scene that late-December day. That’s all she ever has. Ms. Butler, whose role on the sitcom “Grace Under Fire” made her one of America’s biggest television stars in the 1990s, is not a cast regular on “Anger Management,” the Charlie Sheen comedy that just began its second season on FX, but is a recurring guest star. She plays a bartender, a character who appears only occasionally, usually to deliver a few plot-advancing lines, most of them laced with punch lines written by somebody else.“Actually I’m writing a book,” her character would say in that day’s scene, when asked why someone so smart was working at a bar. “It’s called ‘Conversations With Idiots.’ ”She delivered the line with just enough lilt to make it seem more amused than venomous, a put-down softened by her Georgia accent and dimpled but world-weary smile. It’s the same barbed-magnolia delivery that got her noticed as a stand-up comic in the early ’90s and became her trademark on “Grace Under Fire,” in which she played a sharp-tongued, blue-collar, single mom.That show, which ran on ABC from 1993 to 1998, was a Top 10 hit its first two seasons. Ms. Butler was nominated twice for Golden Globes and seemed destined to be the next Roseanne Barr. Then it all came crashing down, an ugly cascade of behind-the-scenes fights for creative control that spilled into on-set tantrums and threats. Crockery was thrown. Obscenities were shouted, sometimes with audiences in attendance. Ms. Butler, a recovering alcoholic who had been sober seven years when she got the show, descended into a Vicodin addiction that, by her own admission, made her unreliable, irrational and, at the end, unable to function.The show, by then slipping badly in the ratings, was canceled five weeks into production in 1998. Ms. Butler, her reputation and career ruined, retreated to her home in the Hollywood Hills and proceeded to fall apart. She was, at the time, 40 years old. She had survived a traumatic childhood, an abusive first marriage to an alcoholic husband and years of working as a waitress in run-down bars. But she couldn’t survive success.“I lost my husband, my job, the respect of people I admire greatly, everything,” she said during a lengthy interview at a coffee shop two nights before that week’s “Anger Management” filming. “But I still didn’t sober up for another six months. The closeness that I came to dying was really remarkable.”And now, 15 years later, Ms. Butler is slowly making her return to television. “She’s awesome,” said Mr. Sheen, who shares a manager, Mark Burg, with Ms. Butler. “Seriously, I think she’s forgotten what a comedic genius she is.” Sobriety, finally achieved after some attempts at rehab and what Ms. Butler regards as divine intervention, wasn’t the hardest part, she says now. It was coming to terms with the damage she’d caused, to others certainly, but mostly to herself.“I don’t recommend journeys of forced enlightenment,” she said. “I spent a long time trying to dig my way out of being unforgiven for how bad I’d been in Hollywood. I would meet people I’d never met before, and they’d say, ‘I hear you’re a monster.’ ”She spent the first few years after “Grace Under Fire” in what she calls a self-imposed exile, rarely leaving her house, rejecting the few offers of work that came her way.“I thought maybe by taking myself away from everything I was good at, or punishing myself, it would correct something in the universe,” she said. “But that didn’t help anybody.”She gained 100 pounds over the course of a few years and found herself more and more isolated. No longer drinking, smoking or taking drugs, it slowly began to dawn on her that she had another underlying problem.“I remember telling a therapist once, ‘I’m not depressed; I’m famous,’ ” she said. “I’m the kid that runs around saying the emperor’s naked. And now they’re all staring at me.”But depression, she finally realized, was at the root of much of her self-destruction. It ran in her family (“We drive at high speeds,” she said, “next to the wall”) and explained a lot of her behavior. “I tend to think of alcoholism and depression as an illness in someone else and a moral failing in myself,” she said. “I didn’t realize until about two years into it how depressed I was. I took a quiz online and basically, when I finished it, it said, ‘Go to the hospital.’ For a smart woman, I was really slow to pick up on it.”She took antidepressants for a few years, and in 2007, convinced she needed to get away from Hollywood, Ms. Butler moved back to Georgia, buying a farm 70 miles northwest of Atlanta, starting what she hoped would be a less stressful life. It didn’t work out that way.Because of circumstances she’d rather not discuss, other than to say “It was totally my fault,” Ms. Butler lost what was left of her once-substantial resources last year. The farm went into foreclosure, and she was, for a time, homeless. She was broke.But not, she says, despondent. Life on the farm had improved her physical and mental health. She lost most of the weight she had gained and also felt herself getting in touch with what she calls a psychic gift, the ability to connect with departed souls. And yes, she knows how that sounds.“No one rolls their eyes at this more than I do at this,” she said. “But it’s real. It’s what they call claircognizance, where I can be around people and information just sort of appears. I’m not sure what to do with it, but there’s going to be something. My dream would be to do some sort of traveling tent revival, but funny. And with no hellfire.”In the meantime, though, there were bills to be paid, which is why last March, traveling with four dogs and three cats, Ms. Butler, now 55, returned to Los Angeles. She jumped at the chance when Mr. Sheen asked her to be on “Anger Management,” in spite of the very small role.Mr. Sheen doesn’t deny that he saw something of himself in Ms. Butler’s story, a sitcom star self-destructing in public and being fired from her own show. He was dismissed from “Two and a Half Men” after his own meltdown in 2011.“Somebody we have in common tried to extinguish that flame,” Mr. Sheen said of Ms. Butler.  “And it didn’t work. That kind of talent never goes away, you know? I always tell her: ‘Don’t forget who you are. Don’t forget how good you are.’ ”So every few weeks Ms. Butler shows up and does a scene behind the bar, grateful for the chance to start over in Hollywood and hoping it might lead to something more.“I’m just trying to show up and be a good worker,” she said, asked if was difficult to be on a set of someone else’s sitcom, to know she’s no longer the star. “It does feel a little bit like being on probation, but that’s not necessarily a bad thing. I’m grateful just for the shot.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/arts/music/asap-yams-partner-to-hip-hops-asap-rocky.html,"THE STORY OF NEW YORK hip-hop’s 1990s championship years is in many ways the story of rapper-executive dream teams, pairings that shaped the sound of the city and, after that, the world. The Notorious B.I.G. and Puff Daddy, Jay-Z and Damon Dash, Ja Rule and Irv Gotti — all of these partnerships made the behind-the-scenes swami as crucial a hip-hop figure as the rappers they helped mold.For ASAP Rocky, the Harlem rapper whose debut album, “Long.Live.ASAP” (Polo Grounds/RCA), just made its debut at No. 1 on the Billboard album chart, that partner is ASAP Yams, his longtime friend, collaborator and co-owner of the ASAP Worldwide label.But you won’t find Yams behind the mixing boards in a studio, or in a corner office at a record label laboring over marketing plans, or huddled with designers creating a fashion line. Just 24 years old, he exerts his pull in extremely nebulous fashion. ”Rocky’s like Luke Skywalker, and I’m Yoda,” Yams said, cackling a bit, one recent afternoon in the South Bronx office that serves as a hangout space for the ASAP crew and where Yams lingers when not at the neat apartment he’s long shared with his mother in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. Rocky may be a natural star, one of the most charismatic figures in contemporary mainstream hip-hop and the one with the most expansive approach to his music. But his road to the top was paved with the help of Yams, who is a spirit guide, a muse, a curator of sonic ideas.Much of what you hear in Rocky — a fully assimilated take on hip-hop styles from across the country and from across time periods — can be traced back to Yams, who spent his formative years studying the genre, then learning how to transmit his taste to others. Hip-hop has long been obsessed with fealty to a specific place and time, and Yams’s vision of the genre as an open house, not a fortress, qualifies as a radical one.He’s happy, though, to exert pull in the shadows.“He don’t want to be Puffy,” Rocky said, recalling Puff Daddy’s late-1990s turn from music executive to frontman. ”He’s the mastermind behind the scenes.”OPEN TO AN OPEN HOUSEBorn to a Dominican mother and a Puerto Rican father, Yams, whose real name is Steven Rodriguez, grew up at the southern edge of Harlem, obsessed with hip-hop. By the time he was 11 he was spending all his free time either listening to the radio or searching for music online. “Even though I lived in the ‘hood, I was still on my Internety geek” stuff, he recalled, whether downloading obscure records off Napster or arguing in Yahoo chat rooms.Other than that, little held his interest. After spending time in four different high schools, he dropped out but managed to secure an internship with Diplomats Records, home of Cam’ron and Juelz Santana, and he also, at the age of 16, managed a few producers, helping them sell their songs to rappers. To make extra money he’d sell mixtapes on the side or steal from the till of the downtown Starbucks where he worked. Sometimes, when his mother kicked him out of the house over one of his “shenanigans,” he’d sleep in Highbridge Park, in Washington Heights.But Yams “always had a plan in his mind,” remembers Duke Da God, his Diplomats boss. At 17 he tattooed ASAP on his right arm; Yams had his eye on building a brand.Yams met Rocky in 2008 through mutual friends, when Rocky was still getting his sea legs as a rapper. Yams saw him as possessing a blend of Kid Cudi’s melodic sense and Mase’s Harlem flash. Rocky also had long, straight hair, pulled into a ponytail. “The good ‘Player’s Ball’ swag, definitely ‘So Fresh, So Clean’ swag,” Yams snickered, referring to some early Outkast looks. Rocky was seeking “somebody who could actually kind of direct to get to where we need to go, and that’s what Yams was. He was like the director.”That meant almost daily work in the studio: listening to records from all sorts of hip-hop scenes, trying out different rhyme patterns and melodies, seeing which sounded best on Rocky. Soon he was incorporating Houston’s woozy moods and the intricate double-time rhyme patterns of the Midwest. “Yams is the hip-hop encyclopedia,” Rocky said. “He’s no joke. That’s one person I can’t front on when it comes to music.” New York rap is typically hermetic, but they were not. For years New York was hip-hop’s center of innovation and its historical repository, so for a young rapper to look explicitly elsewhere for influence verged on heretical.The sound they arrived at for Rocky after two years of work included DNA from all of those other places, a platonic ideal of deeply schooled hip-hop.This is a thoroughly modern idea. The Internet has collapsed eras and places, and ASAP Yams spent most of his childhood downloading. That the first artist he molded would sound like the sum of his accumulated taste was no accident.“We wanted to become big,” Yams said, “but we didn’t want to do it by hopping on somebody else’s wave. We wanted to come in the game with our own wave.”By the beginning of 2011 Rocky had a batch of songs that were ready to go. Here again Yams had a plan. Since April 2010 he’d been running a Tumblr — the title is unprintable — which had become one of the most reliable hip-hop tastemaking sites on the Internet, trafficking in obscure gangster rap, scans from old hip-hop magazines, rare photos and all manner of insider jokes. It had a devoted following — it was historical, attitudinal and an alluring blend of street knowledge and nerd knowledge. “That’s what made” his Tumblr “special,” Yams said. “I really mixed both.”The Tumblr was entertainment, a map of modern hip-hop taste, and, for Yams, also a strategic gambit, “a setup.” Using Tumblr, a blogging platform that allows easy sharing of content, was a conscious choice: “It’s like advertisement.” He was building a reputation as an online tastemaker, spotlighting up-and-coming artists and advocating for a taste level that would be receptive to Rocky’s sound when it was unleashed. “I kept my whole affiliation separate,” Yams said. “I was writing about Rocky like I ain’t know him.”In April 2011 he posted “Purple Swag,” Rocky’s breakthrough song, a homage to Houston’s chopped-and-screwed music, to which Yams had heavily exposed Rocky. Within months Yams had gotten what he needed from the Internet: Rocky signed a major label contract and a distribution deal for ASAP Worldwide.That success was a validation not just of Rocky’s skill, but also of Yams’s vision and his ability to infuse it both into Rocky’s music and also into the ears of hundreds of thousands of fans, all without playing so much as a note of music. Yams had built the rapper, and also the audience. All that was left was to convince the mainstream.Or not. While working on “Long.Live.ASAP,” Yams observed as Rocky experimented with more mainstream sounds and producers, glossier songs that didn’t show off their influences as plainly. More often than not, the result was “not our type of thing,” Yams said.“He would never have me doing something corny,” Rocky saidThe album’s breakout single — which has an unprintable title, “Problems” for short — is an outlier in the Rocky ouevre. “If you listen to the album, there’s not really too many radio-friendly records on there,” Yams noted, “but I think the mainstream is going to change.”MOGULDOM, OF A SORTThe day after Christmas, Yams was at Brooklyn Bowl, in Williamsburg, for the first concert of ASAP Ferg, the crew’s next-in-line rapper. He arrived early, sipped Hennessey and Coke and generally had the manner of a victorious politician, cracking jokes with a huge coterie of friends and taking pictures with fans.On the way to Rocky’s breakthrough Yams himself has become something of a celebrity, thanks to cameos (at Rocky’s urging) in Rocky’s early videos, including “Purple Swag” and “Peso.” He has a distinctive look: short and stocky, heavily tattooed, with long hair that he wears loose or knotted into tight braids and with a large birthmark that sprawls across half of his right cheek. He hasn’t taken the train since September 2011. “I was hounded from like 59th Street to 168th Street,” he said with a sigh.About 32,000 people follow Yams’s Twitter feed, which is one of the funniest in hip-hop, full of lowbrow surrealist gems. He’s a reliable generator of new slang — say, using “cozy” as a boast — and is also the crew cut-up, with a magnetic, cheeky charm. For comedy he still leaves the occasional comment on hip-hop blogs. He’s one of the people moving hip-hop culture forward in ineffable ways, who before the Internet might have been untraceable.“They have a lot of value but to people outside the music industry you can’t place that value,” said Chace Johnson, one of Rocky’s managers.What has become widely clear, though, is that he is Rocky’s “rudder,” said Bryan Leach, president of Polo Grounds Music and the man who signed Rocky. Rocky can be eccentric in his fashion, especially as compared with the hip-hop mainstream, preferring high fashion to merely expensive designers, and in some circles his flirtations with other cities’ sounds were read as carpetbagging.For skeptics Yams is a valuable ambassador. “I play the diplomat,” he said. Whether that means reaching out to veteran and emerging artists in different cities or speaking on the phone with the widow of the influential Texas rapper Pimp C or dressing like he’s starring in a 1998 New York rap video, he is the solid center that anchors Rocky’s trips to the margins.But success has brought stress on Yams’s preternaturally relaxed shoulders. He sees people hoping to sever his bond with Rocky, even as Rocky insists, “I don’t let nobody come between me and Yams.”In this, as in all things, Yams is a student of history, and he’s trying to avoid the fates of teams like Jay-Z and Mr. Dash, who split at the height of their joint success. “Whatever they did to Jay and Dame, they already trying to do to us ‘cause they know what I’m capable of and they know what Rocky’s capable of.”He also has his own demons to quell. His stories of crazy tour escapades — like the night at the Coachella music festival when, high on Xanax and syrup, he almost choked on his own vomit in his sleep — are legion and largely unprintable. On his left arm is a tattoo that reads, “Black Out” next to Xanax bars. “Yams has a penchant for living on the edge,” Mr. Johnson admitted. “Black Out Boyz is very real.”Yams admitted: “I got to chill. It’s not a good look up there in the office. They’re not gonna have any faith.”The solution? Keep finding and developing young stars. After Rocky new challenges await. He’ll be working with the extended ASAP crew — the rowdy sing-rapper Ferg, the New York classicist Twelvyy and the rest — and also creating Yamborghini Records, a side label to work with artists outside the ASAP umbrella, like Dash, Vince Staples, Aston Matthews and Joey Fatts. None of these artists are Rocky clones. Yams’s main inspiration in moguldom, he said, is Irv Gotti, who during his tenure at Def Jam helped guide Jay-Z, Ja Rule and DMX, three very different artists, all of whom became platinum stars.“That’s how I’m branding myself,” Yams said, “so when labels see me, they already know off rip that I’m bringing a star into the building.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-mayhem-on-our-screens.html,"Is there a link between violence in the media and in real life?To the Editor:The National Rifle Association’s cynical exploitation of concerns about media violence to obfuscate the need for gun control trivializes a very real public health issue. Recent articles in The Times (“The Real World Forces Its Way Into the Gamers’ Universe,” Dec. 26; “Real and Virtual Firearms Nurture a Marketing Link,” Dec. 25) and elsewhere dismiss links between violent media and real-life violence, but the truth is far more complex.Research repeatedly demonstrates that, for children, exposure to violent video games, movies and television programs is a risk factor for becoming desensitized to violence, lack of sympathy for victims and aggressive behavior. Proponents for allowing purveyors of violent media unfettered access to children dismiss the research because it is correlational and not causal.But public health policy is often based on correlation between behavior and harm, and the correlation between media violence and aggression is almost as strong as the link between smoking cigarettes and lung cancer — and stronger than other acknowledged public health threats such as the links between not using a condom and sexually transmitted H.I.V., and early exposure to lead and lower I.Q. scores.Regardless of the role violent media played or didn’t play in the tragic Newtown shootings, children are harmed by frequent exposure to movies, video games, music and TV programs that glorify violence. We shouldn’t let the National Rifle Association’s smoke and mirrors, or the urgent need for gun control and effective, readily available mental health services, distract from the problem of media violence.We need to stop allowing children to be targets for marketing violent media, and to help parents understand its potential dangers and set limits on its consumption.SUSAN LINN Boston, Jan. 21, 2013The writer is director of the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and author of “Consuming Kids: The Hostile Takeover of Childhood.”Readers ReactAs one of the leading researchers on media violence, I am concerned that research data be correctly represented. There is a large pool of data on media violence and aggression, but the findings have been inconsistent and the studies tend to be deeply flawed.Further, as media violence has become more prevalent, societal violence, including youth violence, has declined to 40-year lows. Societies that share or exceed our media culture in violence, ranging from Canada to the Netherlands to Japan, have far lower violence rates even if you factor out gun violence (because of gun control laws).Our society has a tendency toward “confirmation bias,” noting media effects when perpetrators are young males and ignoring media effects when perpetrators don’t fit the stereotype. Together the evidence paints a picture pointing away from, not toward, media violence as a contributor to societal violence.We know that after societal tragedies, it is common to blame media in a cycle of moral panic. We know that advocacy groups, though well intentioned, are often a part of those moral panics. So too, unfortunately, are some scholars.But the evidence does not suggest that media violence contributes to a public health crisis — far from it. This is not only my conclusion, but the conclusion of recent independent reviews by the United States Supreme Court and government reviews by Australia and Sweden. I encourage readers to seek out the evidence themselves, read studies on both sides and make up their own minds.CHRISTOPHER J. FERGUSON Laredo, Tex., Jan. 23, 2013The writer is an associate professor of psychology and communication at Texas A&M International University.  Ms. Linn is right to call out the National Rifle Association’s disingenuous concern about media violence. The N.R.A. knows that there is a symbiotic relationship between media makers and gun manufacturers.The Times reported last May that using brand-name guns in movies drives sales. It began in 1971 when “Dirty Harry” made the .44 Magnum a household word — and made Smith & Wesson oodles of cash. The gun manufacturers make money twice: first when they license their weapon to appear in a video game or a movie, and again when the depiction drives sales.Our devotion to the First Amendment makes any attempt to contain media violence very tricky. But this isn’t really about free speech; it’s about money. Movie and video-game producers create violent media — boosting the sale of real guns — because it makes them boatloads of money, in the United States and in foreign markets because violence doesn’t require nuanced translation.That payday is hard to resist. But we can, and we should. Public health advocates have been pressuring movie producers to limit the portrayals of smoking to movies with R ratings because robust research has found that movies are the leading cause of smoking initiation among young people. As they say, smoking in movies kills in real life.We should insist that movie and video-game producers do the same thing: protect children by keeping violence out of children’s media.LORI DORFMAN Director, Berkeley Media Studies Group Berkeley, Calif., Jan. 23, 2013 As I read Ms. Linn’s letter, I was struck by how little she backed up her argument with concrete examples. She seems sure that violent media are being marketed to children, but what media exactly? When and how? I see a lot of media with violent elements, but it’s all marketed to adults, and teenagers where age-appropriate. If these are getting into the hands of young children, then that is a failure of parenting.There is nothing intrinsically bad about violent media or any other form of media; they all have a time, a place and an appropriate audience. I have enjoyed many forms of media that include violence and subjects inappropriate for the very young.I find gratuitous gore for its own sake in poor taste, but I would never consider restricting it legally. I simply vote with my dollars to promote what I consider better. We already have tools to prevent children from getting at things they shouldn’t: rating systems, TV channels for children, technological filters. The missing link in the chain is parents.I do sympathize with the challenges that parents face in our interconnected world, but looking to restrict the media landscape is not the answer.NATHAN SKRESLET Richmond, Va., Jan. 23, 2013 Ms. Linn is absolutely right that parents should be the ones setting limits on what their children see, hear and play. Unfortunately, however, the same arguments she deploys in the rest of her letter present the traditional prelude to calls for actual government censorship.Even if the scientific evidence on the issue were settled in the way she claims, which it is not, government restrictions on speech to limit what children see, hear or play will necessarily restrict far more speech than is necessary to address the perceived problem.Censorship, especially in the name of protecting children, is never surgical. It will always limit the legitimate free speech rights of adults and, in this case, children. Consequently, it must be resisted.GABE ROTTMAN Legislative Counsel/Policy Adviser American Civil Liberties Union Washington, Jan. 24, 2013 Ms. Linn’s impassioned argument against media violence — and against the National Rifle Association — is surely well intentioned, but several underlying assumptions weaken her case.Ms. Linn does not differentiate between forms of representational violence. In the same way that an actual gunshot to the face is significantly different from a punch in the nose, media portrayals of violence are not homogeneous, nor are their influences alike.She also states that children are the “targets for marketing violent media.” While this is undoubtedly true to some extent, her assertion does not account for the fact that children are more likely to be curious eavesdroppers, looking in on the representations of violence that are oriented toward older and arguably more mature audiences. Despite being relatively toothless, ratings systems across different media products are evidence of industry awareness that not all content is child-friendly.Finally, despite their tender age, children regularly demonstrate sophisticated interpretive skills pertaining to media, violence, and social attitudes and behaviors. Determining whether or not they are desensitized to violence is important work, but the majority of children who are exposed to media violence do not act out or mimic what they see. Let’s try to learn a bit more from and about them before imposing restrictive policies.MURRAY FORMAN Roxbury, Mass., Jan. 23, 2013The writer is an associate professor of media and screen studies at Northeastern University. Violent art, whether in audio, video or print, is simply an expression of the existing society. In other words, blaming the art is like blaming the mirror.WILLIAM OLIVEIRA Northborough, Mass., Jan. 23, 2013 Ms. Linn’s call to stop the marketing of violent media to children doesn’t go far enough.There can be no argument that frequent exposure to movies and video games that glorify violence harms children. Researchers at the University of Indiana Medical School found that such exposure changes the brains of heavy users, making them less able to understand the effects of actual violence. And we know that the military has used computer simulations for many years to desensitize soldiers and turn them into effective killers.Efforts to protect children from violent media have been thwarted by the courts, citing the First Amendment. We should take seriously the advice of John Howard, former prime minister of Australia, who described in a Jan. 17 Op-Ed column how his country effectively responded to a horrific mass murder. “Australia,” he wrote, “correctly in my view, does not have a Bill of Rights, so our legislatures have more say than America’s over many issues of individual rights, and our courts have less control.”We needn’t scrap our Bill of Rights. But we must consider how to stop the courts from giving constitutional protection to the marketers of extreme and realistic violent images that would have sickened the authors of the First Amendment.EDWARD MILLER Wellfleet, Mass., Jan. 24, 2013The writer is a former editor of the Harvard Education Letter and a founding partner of the U.S. Alliance for Childhood. While I am no fan of gun control, I am inclined to support Ms. Linn’s premise that the deluge of virtual violence to which our children are constantly exposed cannot be good for them. As a child in the 1950s I was exposed to on-screen violence, in westerns and films about World War II, but they always seemed to carry a moral message of consequences. We had our toy six-shooters and role-playing games, but there were always rules and consequences.There is no question that virtual training using digital simulators works well for the military and others. Digital simulators are really just very expensive video games. As in the computer games, if one crashes, the simulation is just reset and the student flies on, or, at worst, restarts the flight. Why would we expect the violent computer games to be any less effective at training the minds of our most impressionable to engage in violence while ignoring all personal and social consequences?While children with a broad spectrum of activities and good adult role models and guidance may handle these games without visible damage, it is not clear that those lacking guidance or suitable role models fare as well.TOM BALLOU Jr. Corpus Christi, Tex., Jan. 23, 2013The writer is a retired Navy captain. Ms. Linn argues that we must acknowledge the correlation between exposure to media violence and violent behavior. At Common Sense Media, we fully agree, and think that industry leaders must also acknowledge that violent movies and video games are being marketed to children from a very young age, and take steps to advertise more responsibly.The new normal in this country plays out every weekend: Parents take their children to a movie theater, or gather to watch a football game, and are almost immediately bombarded with trailers or commercials for films and video games rated for mature audiences. At Common Sense, we talk to parents every day who face this challenge.In a recent poll we commissioned with the Center for American Progress, 77 percent of parents believed that media violence, such as content in TV, movies, and video games, contributes to America’s culture of violence.The entertainment industry should behave responsibly when it comes to marketing violent movies and video games. That’s why we’ve asked the leaders of the major networks, the National Football League and the National Basketball Association to exercise restraint and responsibility in considering the advertisements they feature in their broadcasts. We also believe that the Motion Picture Association of America has a responsibility to ensure that movie trailers shown before films are of an equal or lesser rating than the films they precede.We don’t want to see media used as a scapegoat while ignoring the need for real action on access to guns and mental health. The solution to the problem of violence in our world is not an issue of either/or. The only way to ensure that our children grow up in a world that’s safe and filled with opportunity is to look at all the factors involved in our culture of violence. And in that mix, the marketing of violent content cannot be ignored.JAMES P. STEYER San Francisco, Jan. 24, 2013The writer is chief executive and founder of Common Sense Media, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the media and technology lives of children and families.  Ms. Linn is right. Children are constantly targeted by predatory companies that seek to exploit their innocence, as they’re not old enough to wisely respond to what they’re being sold. Marketing to children is unethical, and especially so with the marketing of violent media. Children deserve protection from the bully culture that can poison their minds and spirit.RAFFI CAVOUKIAN Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, Jan. 23, 2013The writer is the singer and founder of the Center for Child Honoring.The Writer RespondsThere’s no question that violent media are heavily marketed to children. I direct Mr. Skreslet to several Federal Trade Commission investigations detailing how extensively kids are targeted — including through media-linked toy and food promotions and advertising on children’s television channels.The rating systems he describes as adequate protection provide confusing and misleading information to parents. Research shows that movies that once would have been rated R for violence are now rated PG-13.As for Mr. Ferguson’s critique: After reviewing over 1,000 studies, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Psychological Association and other major public health organizations found that exposure to media violence is a risk factor for aggression, lack of sympathy for victims and desensitization to violence. The evidence continues to mount, including a meta-analysis of research on video-game violence by researchers from the United States and Japan that showed similar findings across cultures.Identifying children’s exposure to media violence as a public health problem and one of many factors contributing to societal violence doesn’t constitute a “moral panic.” It’s a common-sense response to powerful industries profiting from teaching kids that violence is a normal, even desirable, response to conflict.As Mr. Rottman suggests, it’s crucial that media companies be free from government censorship and able to create any content they please. But they shouldn’t have the right to bypass parents and advertise violent media directly to children.SUSAN LINN Boston, Jan. 25, 2013"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/movies/awardsseason/gatekeepers-oscar-nominee-has-muted-reaction-in-israel.html,"JERUSALEM — The Oscar-nominated documentary “The Gatekeepers” braids the recollections and reflections of six former chiefs of the Shin Bet, Israel’s internal security service, into a disturbing narrative of their country’s occupation of the Palestinian territories since 1967. In the United States the confessions of these tough terrorist hunters have startled and provoked audiences, fueling the criticism among Jewish liberals of the right-leaning Israeli government’s expansion of settlements in the West Bank.But one of the subjects of the film, Ami Ayalon — who followed his Shin Bet tenure with several years in Parliament — worries that the film will have less impact where it is most important, because “most Israelis who saw it are Israelis who are convinced.”“Most Israelis are not listening,” Mr. Ayalon, who ran the Shin Bet from 1996 to 2000, said in an interview. “When it is too tough, the easiest way to deal with it is to close our eyes and to close our ears.”The big question is whether the 97-minute, $1.5 million “Gatekeepers” will change that. It has already captured the attention of the world: at least 10 American film critics, including two from The New York Times, put it in their best-of-2012 lists, and Israel’s Foreign Ministry gets inquiries almost daily from its embassies about how to handle the reaction in countries where “The Gatekeepers” will soon be screened. (After an Oscar-qualifying run last year the movie opens in New York and Los Angeles on Friday.)Here in Israel the film has received positive reviews and praise by newspaper columnists since its festival premiere last summer and opening on Jan. 1 but has not exactly started a revolution. The issues it raises were not, for example, a factor in the elections on Tuesday. By last Sunday about 22,000 people here had seen the film — a lot for an Israeli documentary but still a tiny fraction of the population of nearly eight million.The message of “The Gatekeepers,” formed from the collective wisdom of the six living former Shin Bet leaders, is this: The occupation is immoral and, perhaps more important, ineffective. Israel should withdraw from the West Bank as it did from the Gaza Strip in 2005. And the prospect of a two-state solution to the Palestinian conflict diminishes daily, threatening the future of Israel as a Jewish democracy.(The film also confronts internal Jewish terrorism, including the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin in 1995 and a plot to blow up the Temple Mount in the 1980s.)While public opinion polls show most Israeli Jews still support the creation of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, increasing numbers have lost faith that it could happen in their lifetimes.“The question is whether those people who believe there is no one to talk with, nothing to talk about, and we are condemned to go on fighting and killing for the next 10 generations — and they are supported and empowered by our political community — whether they will be open to see the different view,” Mr. Ayalon said. “Probably it is too difficult.”Dror Moreh, the 51-year-old director of the film, said over coffee recently that its power is not so much the message as the messengers. He got the idea for “The Gatekeepers” while working on a 2008 documentary about former Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, whose chief of staff described a  2003 article in an Israeli newspaper that quoted Shin Bet leaders as critical in persuading Mr. Sharon, once called the father of the settlements, to evacuate those in the Gaza Strip. “The Fog of War,” Errol Morris’s 2003 documentary about the lessons that Robert S. McNamara, the former United States defense secretary, learned during Vietnam, was also a source of inspiration.One or two dissenters from the security establishment can be dismissed as having gone soft or having an ax to grind, Mr. Moreh said, but not all six former chiefs of the Shin Bet since 1980. They talk with a mix of pride and shame about brutal interrogations and deadly operations, with one referring to a particular assassination as “very clean and elegant.” They are not your typical peaceniks. (Though the film’s opening title card says the men had never been interviewed before, that is not technically true. Four of them broke their agency’s code of silence for the 2003 article, and the others have spoken out since.)“They know better than anybody else,” Mr. Moreh said of his subjects. “They have been there, they have done the work.” He added, “Any Israeli who is not corrupted ideologically, who when he looks in the mirror he doesn’t say the mirror is crooked, will have to listen eventually to what they are saying.”What are they saying? “In the war against terror forget about morality.” That’s Avraham Shalom, who resigned in disgrace in 1986 after ordering the killing of two Palestinians who had hijacked a bus. “You can’t make peace using military means,” says Avi Dichter, who ran the agency from 2000 to 2005 and is now home front minister.Mr. Ayalon: “You ask yourself less and less where to stop.”Mr. Shalom again: “There was no strategy, just tactics.”Yaakov Peri, who was elected to Parliament last week as a member of the new centrist There Is a Future party: “When you leave the Shin Bet, you become a bit of a leftist.”Mr. Moreh said that as a child in the tough Jerusalem neighborhood Kiryat Yovel he “used to run from school to a cinema that showed three movies in one sitting.”He devoured westerns, science fiction, and monster movies, he recalled, “just to forget about everything and go into this charm of being in the cinema and allow myself to be sucked into a completely new reality, a completely new world of whatever I wanted to see.”Yet when he became a filmmaker he turned his lens on the reality around him. “Look, I live in Israel,” he said. “To do movies like ‘Raiders of the Lost Ark’ and, let’s say, ‘The Hobbit,’ is something that you do out of pleasure. The troubles going on in Israel oblige you to create films that seem more, I would say, important.”Besides the Sharon documentary he also directed a 2003 documentary about an Israeli journalist in the Iraq war. He is turning “The Gatekeepers” into a five-part series for Israeli television and a book.“The Gatekeepers” is actually one of two Israeli films about the occupation to be nominated for the best documentary Oscar this year. The other, “Five Broken Cameras,” is a $250,000, intimate movie mostly of video shot by a Palestinian who spent years at weekly protests of Israel’s separation barrier encroaching on his West Bank village. Mr. Moreh’s, in contrast, is slick and makes rare documentary use of computer-generated imagery.As the Shin Bet directors describe operations, viewers often see a bank of monitors seemingly tracking the movement of suspected terrorists via drone cameras; they were created for the film. Ditto with the supposed Shin Bet file cabinets, dossiers and maps of collaborator locations. The video of the bus hijacking was invented digitally from a handful of still photographs shot by journalists that night.“I won’t tell you when it is real and when it is recreated,” Mr. Moreh said. “When you see the film nobody can tell.”The Israeli press has mostly praised the film. Uri Klein, film critic of the liberal daily Haaretz, called it “one of the most intelligent, mature and self-disciplined documentaries that have been made here recently.” Ariel Rubinstein, a professor of economics at Tel Aviv University and a longtime activist in the peace movement, described it in an essay in the newspaper Yediot Aharonot as “the dream document of those who wish to convince by the power of words just how devastating the occupation is.”But Aluf Benn, the editor of Haaretz, wrote in a recent column that the film is “convenient for the Shin Bet,” painting its chiefs as victims of the political leadership and going light on their own bending of the law. Palestinians, Mr. Benn complained, “are depicted in the film as stereotypes: an Arab and a donkey in black and white, youths throwing stones, a screaming mob running behind an ambulance.”Ofra Ben Yaacov, an official in the Foreign Ministry’s culture division, said she considered the movie a must-see for Israeli ambassadors and their aides abroad, despite its devastating criticism of government policy, if only so that they can engage critics.“Of course it’s a little problematic if you’re talking from the point of hasbarah,” Ms. Ben Yaacov said, using a Hebrew term for propaganda. “If we are trying to export our art in all different fields, the question is whether it will be better to take only things that are good to Israel, that don’t ask any questions, that don’t raise any dilemmas. From my point of view the answer is not — you have to be open and not be a censor.”A spokesman for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the prime minister had not seen “The Gatekeepers” and had no plans to. Mr. Moreh, whose dream “is to go to the White House and show the film to Obama,” said Mr. Netanyahu had also not sent a message of congratulations about the Oscar nomination.And if he wins?“I’m not expecting him to call me,” Mr. Moreh said. “I would ask him to go and see the film and to think over what is said in the film from the people who are most responsible for the security of the state of Israel.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/nyregion/kent-l-barwick-on-saving-grand-central-with-help-of-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis.html,"There was a woman on the phone claiming to be Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. Yeah, right. But Kent L. Barwick had his assistant put the call through anyway. Sure enough, it was herself, the breathy voice a dead giveaway. “We’d never met,” Mr. Barwick said, “but it was unmistakably her.”Thus, on a January day in 1975, began one of the more compelling journeys in landmarks preservation, with enduring consequences beyond the most immediate: saving Grand Central Terminal from a skyscraper that would have been plopped on top of it to ruinous effect.With the 100th anniversary of Grand Central being celebrated this week, it is a splendid moment to remember how this New York beauty was nearly destroyed, just as its crosstown sister, the old Pennsylvania Station, had been in the 1960s. Mr. Barwick was at the center of events back then.When Mrs. Onassis entered his life, he was executive director of the Municipal Art Society, a venerable New York institution that likes to think of itself as prodding the political class toward sensible development. Embrace the future and preserve the best of the past. What could be simpler? What, in a city of high-decibel disputes and litigation, could be more complex?Over the years, Mr. Barwick has held an assortment of civic titles. For a stretch, he was chairman of the city’s Landmarks Preservation Commission. He has been president of the Municipal Art Society three separate times, and at 71, is now a director emeritus. Should they ever install a revolving door at the building on West 57th Street where the society has its office, they might consider naming it after him.But back to that phone call. Where better to look back on it, Mr. Barwick suggested, than Grand Central itself? That led to dinner at Michael Jordan’s the Steakhouse N.Y.C., a restaurant with a mouthful of a name but also with a balcony commanding a grand view of the terminal’s main concourse below.First, some background may be in order:In January 1975 a state judge invalidated the city’s designation of Grand Central as an official landmark, thus removing the major obstacle to that proposed skyscraper. The administration of Mayor Abraham D. Beame was reflexively disinclined to appeal the ruling. The city was broke, and the company behind the building plans had threatened lawsuits if there was an appeal, with a potential cost to the municipal treasury in the millions. “In those days,” Mr. Barwick said, “millions of dollars sounded like money.”So the first order of business was to persuade City Hall to keep plugging away in the courts. That required political pressure. And so a committee to save Grand Central was formed, with the art society at its heart.Enter the city’s most famous East Sider, Jackie Onassis.“She said, ‘Can I help?’ ” Mr. Barwick recalled to his tablemate over pre-dinner glasses of Malbec, his voice competing on occasion with announcements of departing trains. He told her about the new committee and its planned unveiling at a news conference in Grand Central’s Oyster Bar. “She said: ‘I’m sort of around. Just let me know. I’m sure I can make it.’ ” That she did, and she kept showing up whenever needed.“She was smart,” he said. “She had a visceral sense of architecture and style and politics.” In short, “she was just a trouper.” Here is a measure of her importance: “It would have stayed a local story, I think, except for her. Over the course of the campaign, there was enormous interest built around the country. We used to get $5 bills sent in from Iowa. It had a transformative effect.”We needed to pause. The waiter was at his elbow.Actually, Mr. Barwick had preferred to go to the Oyster Bar, but the noise level there can make conversation difficult. A balcony table at Michael Jordan’s made for a fine substitute.He and his tablemate ordered off the Restaurant Week menu. He had the grilled Atlantic salmon. His companion chose the boneless rib-eye steak. Both started with a roasted beet salad, and finished with chocolate cake. The Malbec lasted them through dinner.“The story of how Grand Central was saved is an important story,” Mr. Barwick said, resuming the narrative.Soon enough, the city yielded to Mrs. Onassis and her colleagues, and agreed to appeal. As the case went to ever higher judicial levels, the landmark designation was upheld, ultimately by the United States Supreme Court in 1978.“It changed how America thought about historic preservation,” Mr. Barwick said. “By the time the case was over, all the other major cities had come in as amicus curiae. So it wasn’t just a victory for New York. It was a victory for Chicago and Los Angeles and everybody else. The Supreme Court decision established that cities had the right to protect the public environment.”The conversation turned to a few latter-day issues.Like post-Sandy New York. (“We’re now forced to take seriously the environmental consequences of how we build, but it would be insane for New York to turn its back on the water.”) Like Atlantic Yards in Brooklyn. (“The public should be at the table with a stronger hand in shaping the project.”) Like the mayor’s desire before the year is out to rezone the area around Grand Central for increased development. (“I don’t think something like that should be rushed into in the final hours of somebody’s administration.”)But the past dominated, including how Mr. Barwick got into this game.Back in the 1960s, he said, he “was hanging out at McSorley’s, posing as a writer.” That, of course, is the saloon on East Seventh Street, off Cooper Square, immortalized ages ago by Joseph Mitchell in The New Yorker.“I got involved in a Cooper Square renewal program,” Mr. Barwick said, “and I took courage in hand to call Joe Mitchell.” He continued, “In those days you could call The New Yorker and ask to speak to Joe Mitchell, and you could get him. Can you imagine? He took me to City Hall, and we waited in line for hours, and then we each had two or three minutes in front of the mayor.” That was Mayor Robert F. Wagner.Mr. Mitchell taught him about “failed projects and duplicitous deals” that sometimes pass for urban planning. One thing led to another, and he landed at the Municipal Art Society in 1969, six years before he found Jackie Onassis on the line.He has lived for decades in the area known these days as NoLIta — “we think we live in Little Italy,” he demurred — but Grand Central is often on his daily path.“The genius of this place,” Mr. Barwick marveled. “When I come into this building it never fails — ” He cut himself short to survey the terminal concourse. He spotted two women. They stood near the information booth, talking and pointing at the majestic ceiling. “There they are, those two,” he said excitedly. “Someone’s looking up, and someone else is explaining what all this is.“That means they own it. And that is such a pleasure to see.”"

Eventually joined by her son Michael Houston, she recounts what she knew about her daughter’s drug use, how she felt about her marriage to the R&B singer Bobby Brown and the real story behind her relationship with her best high school friend, Robyn Crawford. Her book “Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped” will be released Tuesday. “Remembering Whitney: The Oprah Interview,” a two-hour interview from “The Oprah Winfrey Show” in September 2009, in which Whitney Houston discussed her drug abuse and marriage, and performed “I Didn’t Know My Own Strength,” is rebroadcast at 8.6 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/arts/television/stanley-karnow-historian-and-journalist-dies-at-87.html,"Stanley Karnow, a Pulitzer Prize-winning historian and journalist who produced acclaimed books and television documentaries about Vietnam and the Philippines in the throes of war and upheaval, died on Sunday at his home in Potomac, Md. He was 87.The cause was congestive heart failure, said Mr. Karnow’s son, Michael.For more than three decades Mr. Karnow was a correspondent in Southeast Asia, working for Time, Life, The Saturday Evening Post, The Washington Post, NBC News, The New Republic, King Features Syndicate and the Public Broadcasting Service. But he was best known for his books and documentaries.He was in Vietnam in 1959, when the first American advisers were killed, and lingered long after the guns fell silent, talking to fighters, villagers, refugees, North and South Vietnamese political and military leaders, the French and the Americans, researching a people and a war that had been little understood.The result was the 750-page book “Vietnam: A History,” published in 1983, and its companion, a 13-hour PBS documentary, “Vietnam: A Television History.” Unlike many books and films on Vietnam in the 1960s and ’70s and the nightly newscasts that focused primarily on America’s role and its consequences at home and abroad, Mr. Karnow addressed all sides of the conflict and traced Vietnam’s culture and history.“Vietnam: A History” was widely praised and a best seller. The documentary, with Mr. Karnow as chief correspondent, was at the time the most successful ever produced by public television, viewed by an average of nearly 10 million people a night through 13 episodes. It won six Emmy Awards, as well as Peabody, Polk and duPont-Columbia awards.Six years later, Mr. Karnow delivered his second comprehensive book and television examination of a Southeast Asian nation. The book, “In Our Image: America’s Empire in the Philippines” (1989), was a panorama of centuries of Filipino life under Spanish and American colonial rule, followed by independence under sometimes corrupt American-backed leaders. It won the 1990 Pulitzer Prize for history.Narrated by Mr. Karnow, the three-part PBS documentary “The U.S. and the Philippines: In Our Image” traced America’s paternalistic colonial rule in the Philippines, the shared suffering of Filipinos and Americans under a cruel Japanese occupation in World War II, and Manila’s postwar independence under regimes nominally democratic but repressive, corrupt or indifferent to the miseries of its people.Mr. Karnow also wrote “Mao and China: From Revolution to Revolution” (1972) and was a co-author of or contributor to books based on his years in Asia, including “Asian-Americans in Transition” (1992), “Passage to Vietnam” (1994), “Mekong” (1995) and “Historical Atlas of the Vietnam War” (1995).Early in his career he lived in Paris for a decade, and in 1997 he published a memoir, “Paris in the Fifties.” A nostalgic reporter’s notebook of life among the cafe philosophers, bereted musicians and pseudo-revolutionary artistes, it danced with digressions about taxes, restaurants, the guillotine, Hemingway, Charles de Gaulle and the Devil’s Island penal colony.In its range, learning and appetite for fun, Bernard Kalb, the former CBS reporter and Mr. Karnow’s friend since Vietnam, told The Associated Press in 2009, the memoir was vintage Karnow. “Stanley has a great line about how being a journalist is like being an adolescent all your life,” he said.Stanley Karnow was born in Brooklyn on Feb. 4, 1925, the son of Harry and Henriette Koeppel Karnow. He grew up in a city with more than a dozen daily newspapers and decided early that he wanted to become a reporter. He served in the Army Air Forces in World War II. After graduating from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in 1947, he sailed for France, intending to spend the summer. He stayed for a decade.Mr. Karnow married Claude Sarraute in 1948. They were divorced in 1955. In 1959, he married Annette Kline. They had two children, Michael and Catherine, who survive him, along with a stepson, Curtis Karnow, and two grandchildren. His second wife died in 2009.He studied politics at the University of Paris in 1948-49, and from 1950 to 1957 was a Paris correspondent for Time magazine, covering Western Europe and North Africa. As Algeria’s war of independence shook France with increasing violence, Mr. Karnow was posted to North Africa in 1958.In 1959 Mr. Karnow moved to Southeast Asia, established a base in Hong Kong and traveled widely in a region rife with conflicts. He was not typical of the Western correspondents, most of whom worked for one publication, dropped into war zones or political hot spots, wrote a few articles and moved on. He often had more than one employer, including weekly newsmagazines and other publications without daily deadlines, and he was drawn to reporting in greater depth and longer, more analytical writing forms.Mr. Karnow was an Asian correspondent for Time-Life from 1959 to 1962, The London Observer from 1961 to 1965, The Saturday Evening Post from 1963 to 1965 and The Washington Post from 1965 to 1971. He was a diplomatic correspondent for The Washington Post in 1971 and 1972, and a special correspondent for NBC and an associate editor of The New Republic from 1973 to 1975.In his first book, “Southeast Asia” (1962), an illustrated Life World Library volume, he noted that Ngo Dinh Diem, South Vietnam’s authoritarian anti-Communist president, was in danger of being overthrown. In November 1963, President Diem was slain in a military coup that the Kennedy administration had tacitly endorsed.Besides reporting periodically from Vietnam, Mr. Karnow covered news events across the region, including President Richard M. Nixon’s historic trip to China in 1972, for The Washington Post. Although he was one of 87 news representatives chosen by the White House to accompany Nixon to China, Mr. Karnow was also on the White House “enemies list” made public by the Senate Watergate committee in 1973.As China emerged from decades of isolation, Mr. Karnow’s book “Mao and China” examined the nation’s history from the Communist revolution through the Cultural Revolution, and also looked at Chairman Mao’s often conflicting roles in the period.After the Vietnam War Mr. Karnow was a columnist for King Features from 1975 to 1988, wrote for the French newsweekly Le Point from 1976 to 1983 and for Newsweek International from 1977 to 1981, and was an editor with the International Writers Service from 1976 to 1986.He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1958 and was a recipient of many awards, including the Shorenstein Prize for reporting on Asia."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/media/south-park-creators-fortify-their-content-empire.html,"When it comes to success stories in the entertainment world, it doesn’t get much better than the one about a pair of regular guys from Colorado, Matt Stone and Trey Parker, who took cutout paper dolls, animated them and triumphed on cable television, on the Web, at the multiplex and on Broadway.Last week, Mr. Stone arrived at a coffee shop in the Chelsea neighborhood of New York so bundled up that he resembled Kenny, who always shows up on “South Park” encased in a big orange parka. He was leaving the next day for London, where the fourth production of “The Book of Mormon” will soon begin a run.Over the course of 16 seasons and 237 episodes, “South Park,” an assault on good taste built on the misadventures of four crudely animated and crudely spoken boys, has entered every pore of the culture. In the meantime, the two creators have helped put Comedy Central on the map, made four feature films, produced a sitcom and landed a Broadway hit with “Book of Mormon,” produced by Scott Rudin and Anne Garefino and created along with Robert Lopez.Now Mr. Stone and Mr. Parker are about to finish a video game version of “South Park,” and they recently announced that they were forming a production company called Important Studios, valued at $300 million.The success of “South Park” is a stark lesson in the fundamentals of entertainment: if you tell stories that people want to hear, the audience will find you.This is true no matter how fundamentally the paradigms shift, or how many platforms evolve.“We’ve been doing it long enough to figure out that content will ride on top of whatever wave comes along,” Mr. Stone said.You might think that after all they’ve accomplished, they would be ready to step back a bit, and this is essentially true. Don’t worry, they aren’t going to actually kill Kenny, who for years was done away with in every episode. But “South Park,” which generally has been produced in two batches of seven episodes for a total of 14 every year, will be cut back to a single run of 10 episodes, beginning on Sept. 25.“Why did we do seven and seven to begin with?” Mr. Stone said. “We just sort of made that up. And we are switching to 10 for the same reason. It just sounded like a good number, and we won’t break up the year so we can more easily do other stuff.”The change sounds casually tossed off, but there is nothing unformed about the thinking that drives their choices.“There is no appointment viewing anymore,” Mr. Stone said.“In our first season, you had to show up on Wednesday nights at 10 p.m. on the comedy channel to catch the show. Now, I don’t even know where or how people watch our show. We sort of don’t really care about ratings. It’s more important to come up with work that will add to the library in a way that we’re proud of and will make people want to catch the show wherever they want to.”That could happen on Netflix, on iTunes, on an ad-supported streaming format on Hulu, or hosted by the servers in the Los Angeles offices of Mr. Stone’s and Mr. Parker’s company.The two men had the prescience to negotiate a 50-50 split on all digital revenue with Comedy Central, and part of the reason they remain so engaged is that they have real participation in the “South Park” enterprise.“We have always owned our stuff or acted like we do,” Mr. Stone said as he worked his way through a late lunch. He pointed to Louis C. K., the comedian who took his last comedy special directly to fans on the Web, as an example of an artist moving to the sweet spot of the business that she or he creates.“Owning your own stuff means that you control not only the content, but the life you are living while you are producing it,” he said.“And then, if things go well, you can be part of the upside.”Mr. Stone thinks it’s silly for creators to rely only on outside financing. Why drop years of sweat equity into creating something but not invest any cold hard cash?“It took us four years to work out ‘Book of Mormon,’ and when you think of the opportunity cost of that — other projects that we walked by — it would be sort of silly not to put money in,” he said.As a result, they have a big stake in “The Book of Mormon,” which is about to clone its fourth version in London — following New York, Chicago and a touring production — and has combined gross income approaching $5 million a week. That’s part of the reason that they were able to create a studio.“Disruption is overrated,” he said. “If you tell good stories, the platforms are sort of beside the point. We made the most analog thing you can think of, a play at the Eugene O’Neill Theater, and it worked out as well as anything we have ever done.”He went on to suggest that each time new a distribution avenue opens, it has become a window of opportunity for their content.In a week when Netflix broke through to report a profit and Apple seemed to bump up against the upper limits of the hardware that delivers entertainment, the “South Park” guys are proving anew that content will maintain value.“Nobody even cared about DVD rights when we got started,” Mr. Stone said. “There was nothing there. But we started with shows on half-inch tape and people bought them, and then it was DVDs, and then the Web, now iPads and Netflix. Each time, it worked out.”Doug Herzog, president of the Viacom Entertainment Group, which owns Comedy Central, echoed that sentiment. “ ‘South Park’ has yet to meet a platform it hasn’t been able to conquer,” Mr. Herzog said. “We’re happy to take as many or as few as they can produce. Frankly, I’m surprised it took them this long to get to a schedule like this.”Reached by phone, Mr. Parker, a musician as well, said “South Park” ran like a rock band. “Now instead of putting out two albums a year, we are only going to do one, which is more manageable and ensures that it will be something we are proud of.”Given the loyal and frantic fan base for “South Park,” the creators’ decision to cut back on the number of annual episodes would seem risky, except they have been right about a lot of things and have the artistic and financial independence to show for it.“We want to keep ‘South Park’ going for a long time to come, and given what is going on in television, I don’t think it matters as much how many episodes you have,” Mr. Stone said.And just in case I didn’t grasp the level of devotion that Mr. Parker and Mr. Stone inspire, a young man suddenly stepped up to our table with his shirt off. He began speaking rapidly about the impact of “South Park” on his life. He explained that he took off his shirt so we would not forget him, but later Mr. Stone could not remember his name.“He will forever be ‘shirtless dude’ to me,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/us/politics/ryan-says-obama-ignores-fiscal-woes-to-fight-gop.html,"Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the former vice-presidential candidate, said on Sunday that President Obama was ignoring the nation’s problems and was choosing instead to focus on the “political conquest” of the Republican Party.“When you saw his speech, say, at the inauguration, it leads us to conclude that he’s not looking to moderate, that he’s not looking to move to the middle,” Mr. Ryan said in an interview on the NBC News program “Meet the Press.” “He’s looking to go farther to the left, and he wants to fight us every step of the way politically.”In his first major interview since the November election, Mr. Ryan also warned that more partisan gridlock was in store as lawmakers prepared to renew the debate over balancing the budget and raising the country’s debt limit. His remarks echoed those of other Republican leaders, including Speaker John A. Boehner, who said last week that Mr. Obama was seeking to “annihilate” the Republican Party.Republicans were put on the defensive after Mr. Obama’s inauguration speech, in which he laid out a starkly liberal vision for his second term, declaring his support for same-sex marriage, gun restrictions and changes in immigration laws.With his stature increased within the party, Mr. Ryan, who is the chairman of the House Budget Committee, will increasingly be expected to set the tone for Republicans, particularly on fiscal issues.In a rebuke to the president on Sunday, Mr. Ryan said that if Hillary Rodham Clinton had beaten Mr. Obama in the Democratic primaries in 2008 and had gone on to win the presidency, “we would have fixed this fiscal mess by now.”“I don’t think that the president thinks that we actually have a fiscal crisis,” he said. “He’s been reportedly saying to our leaders that we don’t have a spending problem, we have a health care problem. That just leads me to conclude that he actually thinks we just need more government-run health care.”But Mr. Ryan acknowledged that the Republican Party needed to reach out to more Americans, and he signaled a willingness to compromise on some issues.“We obviously have to expand our appeal,” he said. “We have to show how our ideas are better at fighting poverty, how our ideas are better at solving health care, how our ideas are better at solving the problems that arise in people’s daily lives.”On immigration, he said he was hopeful that legislation could be passed this year, if Mr. Obama did not “play politics.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/media/from-barbasol-shaving-advice-across-the-generations.html,"A BRAND born in 1919 is joining the parade of products hoping to define what it means to be a man today.Barbasol shaving cream, sold by Perio Inc., is to begin a cheeky campaign on Monday that carries the theme “Shave like a man.” The campaign includes commercials on television and radio; advertisements online; the Barbasol Web site, barbasol.com; promotional T-shirts with sayings that include “It’s like America on your face”; and a presence on social media sites like Facebook and Twitter.In fact, behavior on social media is among the subjects that the campaign tackles. To make the message seem less scolding or preachy, the TV commercials take an offbeat tack: manly archetypes of the past — a pioneer on the Oregon Trail in 1854, a baseball player in 1920, a G.I. fighting in 1944 — talk directly to their current-day male descendants.The commercial featuring the soldier begins with the actor speaking to the camera. “Oh, hey, buddy, your great-granddad here,” he says. “In case you haven’t noticed, I’m kind of busy here fighting for your freedom in the Second World War.“But now, you’re using that freedom to hurl insults at celebrities on Twitter?” he says. “Listen, hashtag, if you’re not going to fight like a man, at least shave like a man.”The spot ends with the soldier barking, “And stop L.O.L.’ing everything.” The other television commercials mock 21st-century habits like channel-surfing and juice cleanses.The ads are to run on cable channels with large male audiences, like AMC, the Big Ten Network, CBS Sports, ESPN, the MLB Network and Spike.The campaign is the first work for Barbasol by its new creative agency, GSD&M in Austin, Tex., part of the Omnicom Group. Plans call for ad spending to be increased significantly from recent years, when Barbasol ran an earnest campaign that carried the theme “Close shave America.”Barbasol is not alone in using a wry, wink-wink tone to comment on the state of modern man in a nonconfrontational way.Other companies taking a similar approach include Brut, with a campaign carrying the theme “Let your man out,” and Old Spice, with ads that entreat the target audience to “Smell like a man, man.”It is no coincidence that Brut, Old Spice and Barbasol are all venerable brands that want to sharpen their appeal to younger men while at the same time holding on to current customers.“We have such a good, core group of older, loyal fans, and we didn’t want to alienate them,” said Ken Waldron, vice president for advertising at Perio Inc. in Columbus, Ohio.The device of the “ancestors” speaking to viewers “plays into our heritage and works for the older generation,” he said, and the humor of the improbable intergenerational advice appeals to men in their 20s and 30s.Many younger consumers prefer advertising aimed at them to be humorous, and are more likely to “like” funny ads on social media and share them with friends, Mr. Waldron said.“But humor is hard to do,” he said — and that is one of the reasons Perio chose to work with GSD&M. Mr. Waldron cited the agency’s work for a longtime client, Southwest Airlines, whose campaigns carry lighthearted themes like “Wanna get away?” and “You are now free to move about the country.”Duff Stewart, chief executive at GSD&M, said the agency’s efforts for Barbasol began with this question: “How do you take a historic brand, with all that heritage, and make it relevant today?”“There’s a nostalgia for the traditional concept of manhood,” Mr. Stewart said, and a desire for “getting back to what’s real.”But if the ads had expressed those ideas in an overly serious manner, he said, some people might have found them antagonistic.Instead, said Jake Camozzi, creative director at GSD&M, the agency sought “a unique way to poke a little fun at the cultural trends that are happening today,” without seeming to mock viewers or make them the “butt of the joke.”The goal was to produce something that men would respond to by saying, “It has a little bit of irreverence to it, but it’s the truth,” Mr. Camozzi said.Thus was born what Mr. Camozzi called the hook of the campaign: “the guy from the past telling you to shape up.”“It came from a familial truth,” he said, likening the discussion to “an uncle at the table talking to the younger generation” — in a good-natured manner, not scolding.Barbasol is also “a brand with humor in its heritage,” Mr. Camozzi said. For instance, a vintage print ad with a photograph of a beaming bald man carried the headline, “I like Barbasol so well I shave all over.”The primary competitors for Barbasol are Edge, sold by Energizer Holdings, and various Gillette products, sold by Procter & Gamble, including Gillette Foamy, Gillette Fusion ProGlide and Gillette Series.Perio spent $3.7 million to advertise Barbasol in major media in 2011, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP, compared with $2.7 million in 2010 and $2.9 million in 2009. The total for the first nine months of last year was $2 million."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/sports/basketball/celtics-topple-heat-but-lose-rondo-for-season.html,"BOSTON — The official word did not come until the second half, but when it did, the prospects for the Boston Celtics’ season, already shaky at best, took an even darker turn: Rajon Rondo will not play again this season.Rondo, the Celtics’ All-Star point guard, was a late scratch from Sunday afternoon’s nationally televised game against the Miami Heat with what the team called a hyperextended right knee. He was taken to a hospital, where a magnetic resonance imaging test revealed a torn anterior cruciate ligament. Rondo will have an operation and miss the remainder of the season.After Friday night’s double-overtime loss to the Atlanta Hawks, Rondo told the Celtics he had hurt his knee in the fourth quarter but thought it was nothing serious. He played in both overtimes of that game without noticeable discomfort. After the M.R.I., he returned to TD Garden and watched some of the Celtics’ 100-98 double-overtime victory over Miami seated at a table near the team’s locker room, greeting his teammates as they came off the floor after the game.Sunday’s game was the sixth that Rondo has missed this year, three of them because of league-imposed suspensions. Boston is 3-3 in those games.Celtics Coach Doc Rivers said he received the news about Rondo before the game but decided not to tell the players. At that point, Rondo was still expected to be in the starting lineup. He had already participated in the team’s pregame walk-through.“I just didn’t think it was any time to tell any of our guys that,” Rivers said. “I told them after the game. Pretty emotional in the locker room.”Rivers continued: “I like the team, still. Obviously, this is a blow. It’s a huge blow for us. When something like this happens, someone that’s already in our locker room is going to play terrific. And I have no idea who it is.”The loss of Rondo on Sunday did not immediately affect a resilient Celtics team. Miami Coach Erik Spoelstra said the Celtics, who had lost six in a row heading into the game, “played like a desperate team without their engine.” He was not aware that Rondo was going to miss the rest of the season.After the game, Miami’s Dwyane Wade said of Rondo: “You never want to see anyone go down with any kind of injury, especially a season-ending injury. So it’s very unfortunate. He’s a great player, and he really is the leader of their team. Obviously, guys are going to have to step up.”Wade and Rondo were to have been the starting backcourt for the Eastern Conference in the All-Star Game on Feb. 17.Rondo’s injury overshadowed the other compelling story line of the day, the return of the former Celtics All-Star Ray Allen to Boston. As had been the case with other players from their 2008 team, the Celtics played a video tribute to Allen during a first-quarter timeout. There were some boos at first, but then the capacity crowd gave Allen a standing ovation, which he acknowledged.“When you see something like that, all the emotions come out and go back to the great things we did here,” Allen said. “I’ve always said that there is always going to be a part of me that’s a Celtic.”Allen finished with 21 points, 2 shy of his season high, while playing more than 38 minutes. He hit a 3-pointer near the end of regulation that helped the Heat send the game into overtime. He was also booed during the game when he had the ball, which he called “interesting.”“I didn’t expect that,” he said.But even after their stirring victory over the defending N.B.A. champion Heat, the Celtics (21-23) remain in eighth place in the Eastern Conference and face an uncertain future over their final 38 games. The loss of Rondo will make it much more difficult for them to contemplate a serious run at the Knicks or the Nets for the Atlantic Division title, which they have won for the past five years. There is no designated replacement for Rondo; his backup duties fell to Courtney Lee or Leandro Barbosa.Rivers said: “Well, you can write the obituary. I’m not. We’re going to stay in there.”Paul Pierce will also take over some of the playmaking duties. He did that Sunday, recording a triple-double (17 points, 13 rebounds and 10 assists). Barbosa, coming off the bench, had an energetic game (9 points, 4 assists, 3 rebounds), as did Jeff Green.But Rondo is almost irreplaceable, given his confidence and comfort at the position, his role as a team leader and his singular style and game.Asked about the loss of Rondo, Allen said: “It forces a team to circle their wagons. It puts the onus on the guys on the bench and everyone has to reprioritize. It shows what kind of team you really are.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/media/tivli-puts-streaming-tv-on-campus.html,"At Harvard, resident students do not have to borrow their parents’ HBO GO passwords to watch “Girls” and “Game of Thrones” online. They can log in with their own college credentials, getting in the habit of having a cable subscription at an early age.This ability, provided by a start-up called Tivli, may be part of the answer to a conundrum for the television industry. Young people watch less TV than they used to, and some say they do not see the point of an expensive cable or satellite subscription. That could chip away at the profits of cable companies like Comcast and programmers like HBO.But Tivli is an attempt to adapt to the ways young people increasingly want to watch TV — through a computer or tablet or video game console — while keeping the existing cable model intact.Residents at Harvard and, as of last week, Yale, can use the service to stream local TV stations, a couple of dozen cable channels and the universities’ own in-house channels to their devices anywhere on campus. The service is free for the students, since it supplements the university’s existing cord-in-the-wall cable system.Tivli will need to sign up dozens if not hundreds more universities to make a dent in television consumption. But Tuan Ho and Nick Krasney, its two Harvard-educated founders, and the company’s 10 employees have a vision for how so-called TV Everywhere systems could be rolled out in environments like campuses, hotels and hospitals.“We think people just want TV delivered to them in a convenient way, whether it’s in their dorm or on computers, tablets and mobile,” said Christopher Thorpe, the company’s president. “People who are getting what they want won’t cut the cord.”To date, the promise of TV Everywhere — that paying customers could stream live and on-demand TV shows to all manner of devices — has only partly come true, because of technological challenges, conflicts over contracts and concerns that online viewing will come at the expense of the old-fashioned TV set.It can be hard to log in and even harder to know which channels allow what shows to be streamed. Many customers have not even tried. When GfK, a market research firm, surveyed 1,000 paying cable customers last September, 64 percent said they were aware of the TV Everywhere services supplied by programmers, and 52 percent said they were aware of the services supplied by cable companies. But only a third of those customers had actually streamed something by logging in, a process the industry calls authentication.Knowing the necessary user names and passwords is “one of the biggest barriers,” said David C. Tice, who oversaw the research for GfK.Some programmers, like HBO, which is owned by Time Warner, are further along than others. HBO GO, a streaming Web site with a companion app, is widely considered the best in its class, making the company’s cooperation a coup for Tivli.Historically, HBO “hasn’t been available as widely as we’d like” in dorm rooms, said Bernadette Aulestia, its senior vice president for domestic network distribution.Most universities outsource their wired cable systems to the local cable company, a satellite provider or a reseller. By and large, the distributors have not come up with ways to authenticate TV Everywhere apps for students, though many are trying. This has given rise to password-sharing by families and — worse, from HBO’s perspective — pirating of shows.“Gone are the days of the cachet of ‘I have a TV in my room,’ ” said Ms. Aulestia. “These students now have mobile devices instead.”With them, they are forming new media habits. So HBO was intrigued when it took a call from Tivli about eight months ago. “From a technological standpoint,” Ms. Aulestia said, “it’s very impressive what they’ve been able to develop.”Tivli links up with a student’s university ID and Facebook account, making the login process somewhat smooth. Its interface is a channel guide much like that of Aereo, the much-talked-about service backed by Barry Diller that pulls local stations’ signals out of the air and repackages them for Internet viewing.Aereo is being sued by several station owners that claim the service is illegal because it does not pay for the right to retransmit the signals. Tivli takes a different tack: it carries the channels that a university already provides, then adds content like HBO.Mr. Ho and Mr. Krasney graduated from Harvard in 2009. In a joint e-mail message, the said that they created an early version of Tivli because Harvard did not have cable TV service for residents. Mr. Thorpe said that when it was made available to others in 2011, more than half the resident population registered for it in the first few weeks. At Harvard, viewership tends to spike around live sports on Sundays and breaking news events like election nights.Along with Yale, tests of the service are under way at the University of Washington and Texas A&M. “We’re excited about the growth opportunities in other multidwelling environments like hotels and hospitals, where we can take advantage of the fast data networks and high-density populations,” Mr. Thorpe said.Students cannot take Tivli home with them, since it works only on the wireless network of the institution providing it. But by the time students move off campus, the theory goes, they will be hooked on cable — and may expect TV Everywhere to fully exist elsewhere too."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/business/media/mattel-gives-max-steel-action-figure-new-lease-on-life.html,"Not many toys get a second shot at success. Once interest wanes, toy makers often are quick to move to the next franchise.So when Mattel decided to revive its dormant Max Steel line of action figures in the United States, it had a rare opportunity to re-examine the old marketing strategy for the brand. In doing so, it decided this time to shift its focus to multimedia, and let the toys follow.“We have put focus and discipline around franchise development and content development,” said Tim Kilpin, the executive vice president for global brands at Mattel, the world’s largest toy company based on revenue. Plans for the Max Steel brand include an animated television series, a live-action short movie, an online hub, mobile games, graphic novels and, eventually, toys and other products.“If there is a new normal, it’s that there is not just one way to reach an audience,” Mr. Kilpin said. “You’ve got to reach them and engage them through all that’s available.”When Max Steel was introduced in 1999 as a line of boys’ action toys, it found modest success in the United States. But after the terrorist attacks of 2001, it drew scrutiny from its parent.“There were some themes that we were very concerned about,” Mr. Kilpin said, “so we did not pursue the range of opportunities in the United States.”Max Steel faded away in this country, but it continued to sell in South America, where it eventually became a blockbuster hit, outselling Mattel’s top lines, Hot Wheels and Barbie. More than a decade later, when Mattel was looking for a new line to start in the United States, it found one in the back of its own closet.“We stepped back and looked at why it was so successful in Latin America,” Mr. Kilpin said. Mattel found that boys loved the idea of someone who could unlock his potential and become a hero. Mattel tweaked the original concept, making the character Max younger and easier for boys to relate to, and it began to plot a campaign to bring the brand back to the United States.But times have changed, and children are much more media-wise than they were in the late ’90s. To market the revived brand, Mattel took a page from its Monster High franchise, which was introduced in 2010 as a line of fashion dolls, with an emphasis on multimedia, including young adult novels and a Web site that used videos and games.Mattel’s focus on multimedia is no surprise, said Sean McGowan, an analyst at Needham & Company. “Mattel is a pioneer for creating toys with media property,” he said, citing He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, a boys’ action franchise Mattel started in the 1980s.Other toy companies have established similar strategies. Hasbro, the No. 2 toy maker, created a production studio in 2009 and worked with Discovery Communications in 2010 to start a cable television channel called the Hub. Last year, the toy maker Jakks Pacific worked with a subsidiary of Dentsu, the Japanese advertising giant, to produce its first animated television series, “Monsuno,” which was supported by a line of toys and other products.Toy makers are looking for ways to shore up their revenue. Retail toy sales in the United States declined slightly last year, to $16.5 billion from $16.6 billion the year before, according to the NPD Group, a market research company. Mattel is scheduled to report its fourth-quarter earnings on Friday.Mattel would not reveal the marketing budget for the reintroduction of Max Steel, but Mr. Kilpin said it was “significant.”“The best way to put perspective around the scale of it is to say it is a major new franchise launch for the company, much like Monster High was,” he said.Like Monster High, Max Steel will start with a Web site, maxsteel.com, which will begin at the end of February and include games, character biographies and other features. The campaign will include an animated TV series, Mr. Kilpin said, because Max Steel is better suited to episodic television than was Monster High.In FremantleMedia Enterprises, Mattel found an experienced producer of children’s television entertainment that it said could generate excitement for Max Steel around the globe. The show will have its premiere on March 25 in the United States on the Disney XD channel. Then it will be introduced in more than 100 markets.The intent of the wide distribution is to create viral marketing on social networks, said Bob Higgins, the executive vice president for children’s and family programming at Fremantle. “Around the world, kids will start hearing about this,” he said. “Kids want to do what their friends do. If they are watching Max Steel, they want to be a part of that party.”The marketing campaign will also include graphic novels, which help immerse boys deeper into the storytelling, said Elizabeth Kawasaki, senior editorial director at the animé publisher Viz Media.“There has been always traditional publishing with media tie-in stuff,” she said, but children’s properties once consisted primarily of early reader books and sticker books. “The market has really changed now.”Other consumer products will follow, including toys that will appear in stores in August. By then, Mattel said it hopes the brand will be embedded in the hearts and minds of boys.“The first way that they are going to experience the brand is through those storytelling mechanisms,” Mr. Kilpin said. “Marketing ground zero for this franchise will be maxsteel.com.”“We believe we are experts in play, not just in making toys,” he said. “That’s what our job is today.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/movies/joel-coen-on-inside-llewyn-davis.html,"SANTA MONICA, Calif. — What if a folk singer got beat up outside a Greenwich Village nightclub in 1961?Six, seven, or, maybe, eight years ago, as Joel Coen remembers it, that seemingly idle question about an unlucky singer in a hypothetical encounter at what used to be a real club called Gerde’s Folk City started bothering Mr. Coen, who writes and directs off-center movies with his brother, Ethan.Next week some music industry insiders and perhaps a few potential buyers will finally see, and hear, the resulting film at a private, pre-Grammys screening in Los Angeles.It is called “Inside Llewyn Davis.” And it promises to be quintessential Coen brothers fare — but different.For starters, Joel Coen explained, speaking recently over a bowl of oatmeal at the Fairmont Miramar Hotel here, “Inside Llewyn Davis” has a certain kinship with “Les Misérables.”In it almost all the principal actors — Oscar Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake — sing. “There are lots of duets and trios,” Mr. Coen said.While not quite a musical, he added, “Inside Llewyn Davis” is built around full-length performances of folk songs that were heard in the grubby cafes of the Village in a year when Bob Dylan, who kind of, sort of shows up in the movie, had just appeared on the scene.As for plot, Mr. Coen said, there isn’t quite as much as is usual for the brothers, who in the past have written and directed elaborate crime stories like “Fargo” and “No Country for Old Men.” This time they present the travails, over maybe two weeks, of a struggling folk singer, Llewyn Davis, who is portrayed by Mr. Isaac.For the record Llewyn Davis doesn’t really resemble, or sound like, Dave Van Ronk, whose posthumous 2005 memoir, “The Mayor of Macdougal Street,” written with Elijah Wald, served as source material for the film.“The character is not at all Dave, but the music is,” said Mr. Wald, who spoke by telephone last week after having been given an early look at the film with Van Ronk’s widow, Andrea Vuocolo Van Ronk.He said he did not know for years that the Coens were behind an option for film rights to the book, which he based on Van Ronk’s reminiscences, compiling them after his death in 2002. (Mr. Wald had spent years listening to Van Ronk’s stories and got some pages from him before he died but otherwise did the writing.)Mr. Wald said he “thoroughly enjoyed” the movie.But he cautioned that the world of “Inside Llewyn Davis,” having been devised by the Coens, is “less innocent” than one inhabited by Van Ronk, Mr. Dylan, Paul Clayton, the Rev. Reverend Gary Davis, Joni Mitchell, Tom Paxton and the myriad other singers who are invoked in the film. Its story bounces through actual places like Gerde’s, the Gaslight Café and the Gate of Horn in Chicago without explicitly portraying real artists or folk music powers like the impresario Albert Grossman.If the film has had a slight air of mystery in recent months, that is partly because the Coens, working with the producer Scott Rudin, their collaborator on both “True Grit” and “No Country for Old Men,” made the film with backing from the French company Studio Canal but with no predetermined American distributor.After shooting in New York City and elsewhere last year, Mr. Coen said, the brothers finished the movie at their own pace. They could have rushed it into the Oscar season but didn’t. Instead a public debut at the Cannes film festival in May is possible, he said. And by then, assuming that buyers like it as much as Mr. Wald did,“Inside Llewyn Davis” may have an American distributor, an army of publicists and a release date.Working with the musician Marcus Mumford, Mr. Coen said, T Bone Burnett produced the music for “Inside Llewyn Davis.” Mr. Mumford, he added, sings in the movie. Mr. Burnett had earlier provided the old-time music for “O Brother, Where Art Thou?,” a Coen brothers caper that was based loosely on “The Odyssey” and was released in 2000 after a Cannes debut. “This hillbilly music’s going to be big,” Mr. Burnett told the brothers at the time.They were skeptical. But the soundtrack was a hit and has sold roughly eight million copies in the United States.For “Inside Llewyn Davis” Mr. Burnett has helped to re-create the brief flowering of a folk scene that in the early ’60s made Washington Square and its environs an unlikely crossroads for musical influences from Appalachia, the Deep South, the Far West, New England — almost anywhere but New York’s neighborhoods, from which some of its heartiest practitioners, and Llewyn Davis, arrived.It was that cultural disconnect, Mr. Coen said, that lured him and his brother — long fans of folk music — to look for the movie in all of it. Van Ronk, the raspy balladeer of “Cocaine Blues,” which is heard briefly in the film, and “Both Sides Now,” which is not heard, was born in Brooklyn. Similarly, the itinerant singer Ramblin’ Jack Elliott, Mr. Coen said, was actually Elliot Adnopoz, from Brooklyn as well.Over all the music, including the traditional ballad “Dink’s Song,” is drawn from the songbook of the early 1960s. But some slight anachronisms creep in, Mr. Coen said.In life the poseurs and musical poets made things lively for a few short years, before electric instruments, changing tastes and an exploding counterculture left the folkies behind.By the mid-1970s, Mr. Wald noted, Van Ronk, who was a kind of godfather to the scene but never enjoyed the superstar status that fell to Mr. Dylan or Ms. Mitchell, was grumbling that he should have stayed in the merchant marine.When we catch up with Llewyn Davis in 1961, Mr. Coen said, he appears to be suffering frustrations of his own. While Mr. Coen did not say how the Gerde’s beating fits in his story, a Web link associated with invitations to the pre-Grammy’s screening shows the singer-hero getting bounced onto a parked car and pounded in a dark alley.“He’s trying to get some traction in his career and in his life,” Mr. Coen said.“How good you are doesn’t always matter,” he added. “That’s what the movie is about.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/golf/tiger-woods-wins-75th-career-title-8th-at-torrey-pines.html,"SAN DIEGO — There is a shop in the village of La Jolla, Second Act West, where people flock to find vintage clothing. Seven miles away, Tiger Woods rooted around in the past on Monday and dug up his designer game from a few years back, turning Torrey Pines into his second act, west.In winning his PGA Tour season debut for the first time since 2008, Woods was equal parts technician and trick-shot artist. Torrey Pines, the site of 8 of his 75 tour victories, is where Woods’s imagination takes flight, as was made plain down the stretch of his closing 72, which propelled him to a four-stroke victory in the Farmers Insurance Open over the defending champion, Brandt Snedeker (69), and Josh Teater (69). Woods now stands seven victories behind Sam Snead’s record 82.“Does it feel good?” Woods said. “Yes. Does it give me confidence? Absolutely. This is a nice way to start the year.”Woods, who finished at 14-under 274, was ahead by eight strokes with five holes left. On a brisk, windy day marked by snail-like play because of the fog-delayed shotgun finish, Woods lost his concentration and his accuracy off the tee but never his lead, which was four at the conclusion of Sunday afternoon’s third round.“I started to lose my patience out there a little bit with the slow play,” Woods said, “and that’s when I made a few mistakes.”Not that he was worried. “I had an eight-stroke lead,” he said. “So I just needed to stay upright and I was going to be fine.”Woods, 37, has won this tournament seven times. After five of his previous six titles, he has gone on to win at least one major.Does Woods have his aura back? “I won this tournament by four shots, so that’s something I’m proud of,” he said, adding, “I would like to win eight, nine times a year.”It took Woods’s threesome nearly four hours to complete its final 11 holes. Until the wind and the waiting wore him down, Woods’s play harked back to his performance here during his injury-shortened season in 2008, when he won his sixth tournament title with a record eight-stroke victory against Ryuji Imada. Five months later, he won the United States Open on the same course.As was the case in Woods’s glory days, he pulled away from the pack on the par 5s. Snedeker played the par 5s in minus-6. Woods played the same holes in minus-12, which was reason enough for him to smile despite his finish: bogey, double bogey, par, bogey, par.“Pretty much did everything well this week and built myself a nice little cushion,” Woods said. “I had some mistakes at the end, but all my good play before that really allowed me to afford those mistakes.”If there was a single shot Monday that signaled that the Woods of old was back, it was his second on the par-5 ninth.On the tee box, Woods backed off his ball after hearing the click of a camera, a common sound in any Woods gallery but particularly so on this day, when the gates were opened to the nonpaying public.After glaring at the offending photographer, Woods set up again for his shot and blocked the ball with a swing so loose his driver flew out of his hands. “Thank you,” he said in a comment directed at the photographer, who had wisely moved on.“It was not a good time to do that,” Woods said later.He was still steaming as he walked off the tee, muttering an expletive under his breath as he walked toward his ball, which was right of the cart path, in a fenced-off area near a temporary tournament tent.After receiving a free drop, Woods took his 3-iron and hit a 217-yard cut shot that landed on the fairway, 85 yards from the pin. He hit onto the green and two-putted for a par that was routine only in his world.When he arrived at No. 15, a 480-yard par-4, Woods was seven strokes ahead of Snedeker, the leader in the clubhouse. He hit his drive into a hazard to the left to set up a two-putt from 13 feet for a double bogey.Woods hit five fairways in his fourth round after finding 12 of 14 in his second. In his best years, Woods was never the straightest off the tee. His genius was evident in his recovery shots, like the one he hit out of the bunker on the par-3 11th that curled to within inches of the cup.“My short game was back to how I know it can be,” Woods said.He added, “That allowed me to save some pars, save some birdies and move my way up the board.”The resumption of the fourth round at 11:10 a.m. local time prevented any of the tour rookies who did not finish Sunday from taking part in the Monday qualifying for this week’s event, the Waste Management Phoenix Open.Among those affected was Brad Fritsch, who began the fourth round in second place and needed to finish in the top 10 to earn a place in this week’s field. Playing in the group directly ahead of Woods, he got off to a spectacular start, sticking his tee shot at the par-3 eighth while Woods watched from a few feet away.“My heart rate was up a little bit on that shot,” said Fritsch, who joked that he appreciated the large gallery, including Woods, turning out to watch him hit.Fritsch missed the birdie putt but squeezed into the next tournament with a 75 that left him in a tie for ninth, seven strokes behind Woods, who, like Fritsch, left the grounds excited about the rest of the year."

(13, 49) HENRY FORD “American Experience” chronicles the life and times of Ford, from his childhood on a Michigan farm in the 1860s and his dream of becoming a machinist in Detroit to his pursuit of racecar driving, the winnings from which allowed him to incorporate his Ford Motor Company. The result was the revolutionary Model T, a lightweight, durable and fast automobile that cost $850 at a time when the average car sold for more than $2,000. Soon the company was producing 1,000 cars a day. Taking its cue from the meatpacking industry, the company established the first automobile assembly line and controlled nearly half of the American car market. Ford, above with the Model T, also paid a $5 daily wage to reduce turnover, with strings attached. Immigrant workers had to attend the company’s English-language schools, and inspectors from the “sociological department” would delve into their private lives. As Ford became one of the richest men in the world, he found his hatred for the wealthy elite increasing; he allied himself with the common people. But as his ego expanded, so did his anger. Ford blamed Jews for the country’s problems, bullied those who worked for him and displayed withering cruelty toward his only son, Edsel, who died at 49 — a death many blamed on the unrelenting stress of trying to please his father.11 A.M.

Yet, he added, the film is “a dexterous and absorbing visual re-creation of the lighting and the look that Vermeer achieved in his work.”6:40 P.M. (Starz) MONEYBALL (2011) Brad Pitt, below, received an Oscar nomination for his portrayal of Billy Beane, the general manager of the Oakland Athletics who transformed the team — one of the poorest in baseball — into a contender against wealthier franchises by rethinking everything he’d been taught about the game in this fictionalized adaptation of the book by Michael Lewis. Jonah Hill, also nominated, plays Peter Brand, a computer whiz with an economics degree from Yale who’s a disciple of Bill James, the statistician who devised a new way to interpret baseball data. And Philip Seymour Hoffman is the team’s manager, Art Howe, who isn’t about to buy into the approach that his boss and his protégé insist will create a winner. Manohla Dargis, writing in The Times, said that the director Bennett Miller “takes all this seemingly dry, dusty, inside-baseball stuff and turns it into the kind of all-too-rare pleasurable Hollywood diversion that gives you a contact high.”6:50 P.M.

Frances McDormand portrays William’s protective mother, a college professor; Zooey Deschanel plays his rebellious older sister; Philip Seymour Hoffman is the critic Lester Bangs; Billy Crudup is Russell Hammond, the lead guitarist of the band Stillwater, to whom William is especially drawn; and Kate Hudson is Penny Lane, the ringleader of a troupe of liberated groupies who call themselves the Band-Aids. “We don’t have intercourse,” she says. “We inspire the music.” Mr. Crowe “may be the least cynical director working in Hollywood today,” A.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/arts/video-games/dmc-is-the-new-devil-may-cry-game-from-capcom.html,"Action movies illuminate the anxieties of their age. Their villains represent our fears, or at least those that the filmmakers presume we have. These bad guys are the evil-of-the-moment that we might most want to see punched in the face: Soviet masterminds, drug dealers, Silicon Valley moguls, terrorists, media barons.Action video games seem to have an advantage over movies here. Audience members don’t just watch. They press buttons. They have, via game controllers, a chance for catharsis.But many mainstream games, steering clear of almost all social commentary, have remained preoccupied with the hell of war, the coolness of aliens and the ever-present danger that someone out there might want to kidnap Super Mario’s girlfriend, Princess Peach. Real-life anxieties are rare. It is apparently hard to concoct an experience that enables players to punch the global economic downturn squarely on the jaw. The new game DmC at least tries.DmC’s opening moments stand out. A barrel-chested bald man in a general’s uniform completes a cellphone call with a president he has just threatened to blame for the ruin of the economy. We’ll eventually know the bald man as Mundus. He surveys an array of monitors that show offshore drilling platforms. He turns to a haggard, skimpily dressed woman and boasts: “Soon I will own everything worth owning. I will control the world through debt. I have absolute power.” We will later learn that he controls his own 24-hour news channel. What’s more blood-boiling these days than that?This guy, in this game, is going to be punched. By you. That’s the implicit promise of the medium and the genre.DmC is the latest video game in the Devil May Cry series born on the PlayStation 2 in late 2001. As before, its playable protagonist is a man named Dante, who needs to kill demons for some greater good, this time in a modern city possessed by them.To someone only watching them, Devil May Cry games seem like a teenage boy’s profane hormonal vision of what the most fantastic adulthood might be like: the adventures of a carefree, impossibly coifed man who enjoys the admiration of sexy women, has easy access to pizza and wields the weapons needed to eliminate the many devils infesting our world.To those who play them, Devil May Cry games are virtual violence as jazz, with points for variety and deductions for doing the same thing repeatedly. Players have a character to control and demonic enemies to dispatch using an extraordinary mix of sword- , ax- and gun-based maneuvers. The games’ creators have mapped dozens of strikes, shots, parries and evasions to different combinations of button presses on a controller. As fingers stretch, reach and tap with purposeful changes in timing, you might guess that this is what a master trumpet player’s hands feel like.To those fingers, the new DmC is familiar, though less stressful than its predecessors. Like so many modern games, it is easier than those before it. Our hero is tougher, and survival through the game’s 10 hours is all but guaranteed. Going unhit, however, remains a challenge that will be met only by those players swift of reflex and interested in improv.To the eyes and ears, the new DmC has just a little more to do with things that might matter to an adult. The debt-obsessed master villain ensures this. Dante himself remains a fantasy of puberty, opening this game in bed with two attractive women before reluctantly assuming responsibility for fighting an evil only he, of course, can defeat to save the world. But what wakes him feels more real. There’s a report blaring on the Raptor News Network, the game’s fake Fox News, about supposed terrorist threats that turn out to be the exhortations of the in-game version of Occupy activists or Anonymous hacktivists. Bob Barbas, who is Raptor’s Bill O’Reilly, grumbles about these people and then wishes aloud that someone would shoot them. The game assumes you might have an opinion about this. That’s new for this series.It doesn’t take long to deduce that DmC’s main economy-wrecking bad guy is a demon king, and that Bob Barbas is a demon minion. That is its own kind of simple, blame-absolving fantasy. DmC isn’t asking us to think too much.Players spend most of the time fighting street-level demons who neither invite nor evoke any social commentary. The eventual confrontation with Mundus feels disappointingly less like recession revenge and more like a clip from a monster movie, though the scene preceding it — a climb up the floors of a skyscraper in which employees have been motivated with the slogans “Sell More Debt” and “Greed Is Great” — will fit a time capsule well.The showdown with Barbas is more specific and perhaps contains a bit of acting out against news media that have had so much to say about violent games. Dante plunges into a city’s reflection in a river and approaches an inversion of the Raptor News tower. He walks on the underside in this flipped cityscape; at this moment, the whole scene is upside down. The player and Dante find Raptor’s core, where a huge digitized version of Barbas’s head taunts and attacks with cackles and energy beams. It’s Dante’s demon-fighting skills versus an avatar of punditry.Mr. O’Reilly isn’t the only possible target here and maybe not even the most apt. But while DmC may tease and then fail to deliver the satisfaction of giving those responsible for the great recession a hearty wallop, it offers this consolation prize. In DmC we can’t vicariously slay that which would destroy real society, but we can at least have a showdown with an entity whose contributions are dubious: a television talking head.DmC, developed by Ninja Theory and published by Capcom Entertainment, is available for the PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It is rated M (Mature) for gore, intense violence, nudity and strong language."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/sports/baseball/dodgers-sweet-tv-deal-will-taste-bitter-to-fans.html,"In Los Angeles, the number of teams remains constant. It’s just the number of regional sports networks that grows.Not long ago, there were two: Fox Sports West and Prime Ticket, also a Fox channel.Now there are six, in large part because of the aggressiveness of Time Warner Cable. In 2011, it lured the Los Angeles Lakers from Fox Sports West to its new English and Spanish language networks at an estimated price of $3 billion over 20 years.On Monday, Time Warner Cable announced what has been expected for a while, saying that in a deal worth up to $8 billion over 25 years, it will carry Dodgers games on the newfangled SportsNet LA starting in 2014 when the team leaves Prime Ticket.Add to that the regional channel created by the Pacific-12 Conference. While all this money being exchanged might be great for the teams, it’s lousy for the fans. With one team, SportsNet LA alone could add up to $5 a month to the costs of cable, satellite and telephone companies. They in turn pass much of those costs onto subscribers. The two Lakers channels charge $4 a month. And the two Fox channels together cost $5.40 a month, according to SNL Kagan.The Dodgers’ deal shows a company simultaneously at work in two roles: Time Warner is the largest cable television operator in Southern California and a regional sports network creator. In its first role, it wants to avoid, if it can, going through a middleman to buy the rights to marquee sports teams. By creating a network to showcase the Dodgers, it can guarantee that all of its subscribers get that network, while also extracting steep subscriber fees from AT&T, Verizon, Cox, Charter, DirecTV and Dish Network.The new Dodgers ownership — playing out the vision of the disgraced former owner, Frank McCourt — will take in a huge amount of cash just for putting a team on the field 162 times a year. Time Warner will pay the team $7 billion to $8 billion over 25 years.But only a portion of that staggering sum, about $84 million a year, which will rise at 4 percent annually, is designated as the team’s market-value rights fee and taxable at a 34 percent rate for Major League Baseball’s revenue-sharing pool.This is quite nice for the Dodgers if baseball upholds it. The remaining billions it will get — from odd sources like branding rights for Time Warner Cable and buying time on the channel for other Time Warner Cable programming — also rises at 4 percent a year. And that would not be subject to revenue sharing. Sweet indeed; a terrific tax shelter.Once they get a hold of the contract, baseball officials will see if what is slated to be untaxed should really be taxed and available to share. If the money is guaranteed, and not at risk, it should be taxed. Guggenheim Partners, the financial services giant that backed last March’s $2.15 billion purchase of the Dodgers, might reluctantly have to share more than it wants.“Throughout, it seems clear that Guggenheim was eager to minimize the bite that revenue sharing would take,” said Lee Berke, a media consultant who specializes in regional sports networks. “It seems a way to thread the needle to achieve a substantial upside. It’s a complex way around revenue sharing.”The Dodgers-Time Warner Cable deal is the culmination of a tense drama inside baseball that began when McCourt, financially struggling and prohibited by Commissioner Bud Selig from extending his deal with Fox, put the team into bankruptcy. (That deal included a $385 million upfront sweetener.) In a process overseen by a federal bankruptcy court judge, McCourt sold the team last March to Guggenheim.Even at his most nakedly desperate, McCourt knew how much more valuable the Dodgers would be as a television product once the team could negotiate on the open market. That opening occurred late last year when Guggenheim let prospective bidders know that it would make a deal only for a regional sports network. All Dodgers all the time. Fox’s offer, evidently not as enticing or willing to hit the tripwires of baseball’s revenue-sharing system, included giving the Dodgers some ownership of Prime Ticket.The vast sums promised to the Dodgers might lead, on one level, to more Dodgers programming that only Tommy Lasorda might be able to tolerate. But that bounty also seems a precursor to higher costs for sports fans in Los Angeles and everywhere else."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/booming/if-you-like-a-taste-of-honey.html,"If you hated disco back then, chances are you might stop reading. But if there is even a tiny possibility of reconsidering, I ask you to stick with me and give this week’s post a chance. According to an online biography of the group, the opening line of A Taste of Honey's 1978 hit song, ""Boogie Oogie Oogie,"" was inspired by an especially tough and unresponsive audience at an American military base. Hazel Payne, one of the singers, yelled to the hostile crowd: ""If you're thinkin' you're too cool to boogie, boy oh boy have I got news for you! Everybody here tonight must boogie, let me tell ya, you are no exception to the rule!""  In that same no-exception-to-the-rule spirit, I'd like to introduce you to a new-age dance band, Little Dragon, an electro-pop act that NPR says ""makes pop music for folks who think they hate pop music."" A TASTE OF HONEY All I remember is we wore polyester, platforms and paisley. And danced, danced, danced — in long lines of people stepping in unison, pointing index fingers in the air and twirling as one. Everyone took part, regardless of ability. The music brought us together. For the truly brave there was partnered disco dancing (à la ""Saturday Night Fever"") — a flashier version of the swing where the dance floor opened up and the crowd surrounded the pair. It could get dangerous, dodging each other's feet and getting tangled in twirling or twisted arms, beneath one of those blinding, spinning disco balls. I'm glad to report that it was just a phase, but a fun one.A favorite act of the era was A Taste of Honey,   a funk/disco/R&B band from Los Angeles led by two guitar-toting divas. The band was formed in 1971 by the friends Janice Marie Johnson (vocals, bass, songwriter), Hazel Payne (guitar, vocals), Perry Kibble (keyboards) and Donald Ray Johnson (drums). The name came from Herb Albert & the Tijuana Brass's song of the same name. After the group was signed by Capitol Records in 1978, their debut album produced ""Boogie Oogie Oogie,"" which soared to No. 1 on the Billboard pop charts for three consecutive weeks, sold more than two million copies and earned them a Grammy Award for Best New Artist. By 1980 the four had become a duo consisting of Ms. Payne and Ms. Johnson, who produced one more hit, a cover of the beautiful Japanese ballad ""Sukiyaki,"" which topped the R&B and pop charts. Despite their disco roots, they resisted pressure from their label to turn this slow song into a dance number. In the early 1980s they parted ways to pursue solo careers, but in 2004 reunited to take part in a PBS Special, “Get Down Tonight: The Disco Explosion.”LITTLE DRAGONWhen I first heard the Swedish electro-pop band Little Dragon, I didn’t know whether to dance to their music or chill to it. I've discovered that others felt the same way. A favorite XM/Sirius D.J. of mine, Jenny Eliscu, describes the band at RollingStone.com as ""richly textured and highly vibe-y electronic music that could soundtrack both the dance party ('Night Light,' 'Little Man') and the chill-out room ('Crystalfilm,' 'When I Go Out')."" Adam Rathe of Spin.com wrote that their newest album, ""Ritual Union,"" is ""equal parts chill-out room dreamy and club-friendly fierce.” The effect was intentional. The band's drummer, Erik Bodin, told Spin, ""It's an album for multitasking,"" adding, ""Our aim is to make music for people to escape into or dance to.""The band was formed in 1996 in Gothenburg, Sweden, by several high school friends: Yukimi Nagano, a Japanese-American singer who also did percussion, Mr. Bodin (drums) and Fredrik Kallgren Wallin (bass), who often got together to jam after school. ""We were weirdos,"" Ms. Nagano told Spin.com, ""but we found each other and could be in a bubble together."" They added Hakan Wirenstrand (keyboards), supporting themselves with side jobs as they developed their sound. Finally, at a friend's urging, they released their first single, ""Twice,"" in 2007, and they were off. Their music hybridizes genres, being variously described as electro trip-hop, downtempo, synth-pop, indietronica, dream pop and neo soul; iTunes uses words like ""beds of crackling, pulsing synthesizers, and crispy percussion underlying Nagano's plangent vocals; a plethora of ideas and talent."" Their albums ""Little Dragon"" (2007), ""Machine Dreams"" (2009) and the highly acclaimed ""Ritual Union"" (2011) are accompanied by music videos perfect for projecting on club walls, and several tracks have been used on TV shows like ""Grey's Anatomy,"" ""The Vampire Diaries"" and ""Gossip Girl."" Little Dragon has been invited to collaborate with other top artists like Gorillaz, Jose Gonzalez, SBTRKT, DJ Shadow, Erykah Badu and Raphael Saadiq.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/arts/music/new-albums-by-trixie-whitley-and-kris-kristofferson.html,"TRIXIE WHITLEY“Fourth Corner”(Strong Blood)Pain, desire, rage, sorrow, determination and loneliness course through Trixie Whitley’s bluesy moan on her debut album, “Fourth Corner.” She’s haunted in ways both elemental and cerebral.Ms. Whitley, 25, is the daughter of Chris Whitley, the hard-living Texas bluesman who died in 2005; she grew up hearing him perform in studios and onstage. But Ms. Whitley, whose mother is Belgian, also spent years as a member of theater and dance troupes in Europe before moving to New York City in her teens.After she made an EP Ms. Whitley joined Black Dub, the producer and guitarist Daniel Lanois’s group, which released an album in 2010. The group’s smoldering grooves and reverberant guitars were a perfect fit for Ms. Whitley’s own instincts, but she’s even more radical on her own.Her mercurial, dramatic songs aren’t tied to the standard forms or plain rhetoric of the blues or pop. Her melodies hop and swoop asymmetrically, and most of them ride choppy patterns of distorted guitars, played and layered by Ms. Whitley, that circle and seethe until she’s sung all she needs to say.“Hotel No Name” has the buzzing, roaring guitar of Neil Young and Crazy Horse; while “Silent Rebel Pt. 2” hints at Eastern modes. “Need Your Love” ticks and claws like a Radiohead track, reaching its pleading chorus — “I need your love/I need to feel with you right now” — by way of considerably less clear-cut verses:Living in the depths of our constellationWith saviors I’ve dared not seeI’m living off of deprivationTomorrow may not be.Now and then, when guitars give way to keyboards (played by Ms. Whitley’s co-producer, Thomas Bartlett), she has a more straightforward soul side, approaching Alicia Keys territory. Steady keyboard arpeggios and a moody backdrop of strings carry the album’s first single, “Breathe You in My Dreams,” a confession of solitary longing that crests in an urgent call and response.Last year Ms. Whitley released solo versions of four songs from the album on an EP, “Live at the Rockwood Music Hall.” But in the studio she and Mr. Bartlett have made them darker and eerier; strings, electronics and percussion add new shadows and implications. Her are as much philosophical as personal: “Condemned in the eye of a sleeping mind/Wearing out the window of time,” she sings in “Fourth Corner.” Yet even when she’s inscrutable, she’s passionate. JON PARELESKRIS KRISTOFFERSON“Feeling Mortal”(KK Records)Kris Kristofferson is 76, and he’ll be the first to tell you what that means. “Wide awake and feeling mortal” are the first words on the first song of his new record, “Feeling Mortal.” Soon afterward he sings, “I’ve begun to soon descend/like the sun into the sea.” Well, he deserves respect. Let him use a cliché if he wants to. What counteracts the cliché is that no big lessons about existence follow:Pretty speeches still unspokenPerfect circles in the sandRules and promises I’ve brokenThat I still don’t understand.Over the last 20 years or so a well-signed late-career path has been built for musicians like this: typically male, English-language, wriggly-persona singer-songwriters born between the mid-1930s and late ’40s, role expanders and wild cards. (Among others, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson, Bobby Bare, Nick Lowe.) They’re making senior-outlaw records. They can strip off layer after layer until they’re basically releasing demos; dress their productions up in slick period sounds or invented aesthetics; interpret songs from wherever.There are labels ready to market this music, clubs ready to book it, a reliable stable of musicians to play it and almost standardized arrangements and production techniques — fiddles, accordions, acoustic bass, brushed drums. The requirement of the central figure is that he must intimate a grave consciousness about aging.It’s a game, but Mr. Kristofferson plays it well. He had a croaky voice in his 30s and even then was writing well about death drives and shaky mornings. (He’s been writing explicit old-man reflections for a little while now; his album “This Old Road,” from 2005, contained a song called “Thank You for a Life” that seemed like a preparation for disappearance.) On “Feeling Mortal,” produced by Don Was, with a band including the pedal-steel guitarist Greg Leisz and the violinist Sara Watkins, he sounds so relaxed that he’s practically supine, but there’s work and thought going on inside him.You’ll want a lyric sheet. Mr. Kristofferson’s voice wavers, indicating general pitch areas rather than specific notes, and he doesn’t use it artfully to stress images or ideas as he rolls through the words. Some of those lyrics, though, can be dense and strong, working inside and outside the styles and structures of his best years.For the most part he’s looking at himself. There’s a song in which the songwriter compares himself to a boat with torn sails. There are some second-person songs that are really altered first-person: “Just Suppose,” aimed familiarly toward a guy who’s preparing to chase an old girlfriend; and “Stairway to the Bottom,” which is an almost classical mid-1960s-style country-music interior monologue. (“I watch you climb that stairway to the bottom/every evening, in that mirror on the wall.”) And “You Don’t Tell Me What to Do,” the album’s fullest track in sound and word, comes from the point of view of the songwriter’s inner spirit, which might be different from the songwriter himself.But its most outwardly shaggy song, with buzzing guitar strings and a couple of places where Mr. Kristofferson laughs at himself while singing, turns out to be its most stable and wise: “The One You Chose,” directed at a mate, ends with lines that contain wisdom in their great uncertainty.Holding on to something that keeps holding us togetherStronger than the circumstances tearing us apartI’ve just got a feeling, if I’m wrong you can correct meI believe I just sang my way back into your heart.Those aren’t the album’s closing lines, but they should be.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/arts/music/leroy-bonner-of-the-ohio-players-dies-at-69.html,"Leroy Bonner, the frontman of the Ohio Players, a funk band whose influence lasted well beyond the string of hits it had in the mid-1970s, died on Saturday in Trotwood, Ohio, near Dayton. He was 69.His death was announced by his family on the Facebook page of Sugarfoot’s Ohio Players, a spinoff band that he had been leading. No cause was given.Mr. Bonner, a singer and guitarist better known by his nickname, Sugarfoot, teamed in the 1960s with core members of a group called the Ohio Untouchables to form the Ohio Players. The group became known for its brassy, bottom-heavy dance music — as well as its flamboyant outfits and provocative album covers — and reached both the pop and rhythm-and-blues charts with “Love Rollercoaster,” “Fire,” “Skin Tight,” “Funky Worm” and other songs.From 1973 to 1976 the Ohio Players had seven singles in the Billboard Top 40. Both “Fire” and “Love Rollercoaster” reached No. 1.Although the band’s heyday was four decades ago, its sound has been kept alive by others.“Love Rollercoaster” gained new fans through a 1996 cover version by Red Hot Chili Peppers. “Funky Worm” has been sampled by many hip-hop artists.Born in Hamilton, Ohio, about 20 miles north of Cincinnati, in 1943, Leroy Bonner grew up poor, the oldest child in a large family. Information about his survivors was not available.After running away from home at 14, he wound up in Dayton, where he connected with the musicians who would form the Ohio Players. The band’s lineup changed over the years, but its instrumentation and sound remained basically the same: a solid, driving groove provided by guitar, keyboards, bass and drums, punctuated by staccato blasts from a horn section.Vocals were a secondary consideration. “We were players,” Mr. Bonner told The Dayton Daily News in 2003. “We weren’t trying to be lead singers.” The core members of the band did not originally sing, he explained, but “we got so tired of having singers leave us that we decided we’d just do the singing ourselves.”“I used to play with my back to the audience in the old days,” he added. “I didn’t want to see them because they were distracting. Then the first time I turned around and opened my mouth, we had a hit record with ‘Skin Tight.’ That’s amazing to me.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/business/global/dispute-with-antigua-and-barbuda-threatens-us-copyrights.html,"WASHINGTON — A long-simmering trade conflict between the United States and Antigua and Barbuda appears to be boiling over.Antigua and Barbuda, which has a $1 billion economy, is planning on getting legal retribution from the United States’ $15 trillion economy over its refusal to let Americans gamble at online sites based in the Caribbean nation — perhaps by offering downloads of American intellectual property, like Hollywood films, network television shows or hit pop songs. On Monday, the World Trade Organization gave its go-ahead for Antigua and Barbuda’s tentative plan.“The economy of Antigua and Barbuda has been devastated by the United States government’s long campaign to prevent American consumers from gambling,” Harold Lovell, Antigua’s finance minister, said in a statement. “These aggressive efforts to shut down the remote gaming industry in Antigua have resulted in the loss of thousands of good-paying jobs and seizure by the Americans of billions of dollars belonging to gaming operators and their customers.”The conflict’s roots are a decade old. The World Trade Organization said that the United States had violated its trade agreements by preventing Americans from betting at sites based in Antigua and Barbuda. Because Washington is unwilling to make the betting legal, the countries have been locked in a dispute over what constitutes fair trade practices and fair compensation.The online gambling industry was at one point the second-largest employer in the Caribbean country, its government has said, and economists estimated its worth at $3.4 billion. Gambling employment has dropped to fewer than 500 people from more than 4,000 as a result of the United States’ trade policy, it said.On Monday, a dispute settlement body in Geneva gave Antigua and Barbuda the nod to, in essence, violate American intellectual property rights to make up its losses, calculated at $21 million a year.It remains murky just how the Antigua and Barbuda government might go about it. But trade watchers suggested it might set up a site where viewers could pay a pittance to watch a film or television show with an American copyright. The United States might not be able to shut the site down under international law.“We are disappointed with Antigua and Barbuda’s decision to abandon constructive settlement discussions,” Nkenge Harmon, a spokeswoman for the United States trade representative, said in an e-mail. “As recently as Friday, our two countries held high-level discussions on possible settlement options that would have brought real benefits to Antigua’s businesses and people.”The Obama administration said that the proposed plan might further hurt trade relations between the two countries.“If Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft of intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua’s own interests,” Ms. Harmon said. “Government-authorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major impediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries.”Trade experts said that Antigua and Barbuda’s plan for retribution seemed designed to provoke American filmmakers and recording artists into pushing for Congress to allow foreign Internet gambling sites to serve American customers.They also noted that it was the United States that had pushed for the unusual “cross-retaliation” mechanism at the W.T.O., where trade violations that hurt one industry could be countered with trade actions against a completely different industry.“The irony is rich, rich, rich,” said Lori Wallach, the director of Global Trade Watch at Public Citizen, a Washington-based consumer advocacy group.“The practical question is, Is there a majority in the House and Senate to vote to revoke the ban, and would Congress do it because the W.T.O. told them?” she said, saying it was unclear how the two countries would proceed."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/29/arts/dance/miami-city-ballet-in-liam-scarlett-work-at-kravis-center.html,"WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Miami City Ballet, one of America’s most beloved dance companies, is in an interim condition. Its repertory for the 2012-13 season was chosen by its departed artistic director, Edward Villella, but the company is led by his successor, Lourdes Lopez. While it’s too early to tell how the change in leadership will affect the company’s style, a recent visit showed the dancers in fine fettle.Last weekend I caught the final performances of the second program of its season at the Kravis Center here. Gary Sheldon conducted the Opus One Orchestra well; though Alla Krolevich’s solo violin was sometimes squeakily thin, Francisco Rennó was an excellent solo pianist. A quadruple bill titled “Tradition and Innovation,” it consisted of two Balanchine ballets (the Mozart “Divertimento No. 15” and the Stravinsky “Duo Concertant”), one attributed to Marius Petipa (the “Don Quixote” pas de deux) and a world premiere (“Euphotic”) by the British choreographer Liam Scarlett. The program’s title seemed to suggest that Petipa represents tradition, Mr. Scarlett represents innovation and Balanchine includes both.Certainly in Balanchine you see tradition and innovation marvelously wed. The curtain no sooner rises on the tableau that starts “Divertimento No. 15” than the audience applauds an ideally harmonious and Mozartian world. But the way these women then step off balance and stretch their bodies up to the fullest exposure subverts genteelly conventional ideas of Mozartian decorum. “Duo Concertant” surprises its audience even more: Balanchine leaves parts undanced, like a radical painter who knows where to leave the canvas untouched, sketches in other parts with what feels like utter spontaneity, and then confounds expectation with an astonishing male-female drama indicating love, inspiration and devotion.Many New Yorkers know these ballets well. It’s heartening to watch them, though, amid audiences unfamiliar to them, often exclaiming out loud at their twists. In “Divertimento No. 15” the Miami women — scintillatingly musical — perfectly show how Balanchine combined womanliness with youthfulness; they’re both fresh, like buds, and decisive. The men’s lucid elegance is also a pleasure.The “Don Quixote” number, however, is just a cartload of ballet clichés, most of which were certainly added long after Petipa’s death. And is “Euphotic” innovative?Certainly you can see how the 26-year-old Mr. Scarlett has so quickly achieved a reputation as an important choreographer. He smartly handles shifting large-scale geometries, he responds to music with taste, and he matches energetic full-orchestra conclusions with excitingly fast-changing formations that fill the stage. These are no small accomplishments. Yet much of this choreography is just skilled bluster.The title “Euphotic” refers to the layer of a body of water that receives sufficient sunlight for photosynthesis. The costumes and backdrop (designed by Mr. Scarlett himself), mixing blues and yellows, and John Hall’s part-murky lighting may suggest some kind of aquarium. This doesn’t, however, get us far.Mr. Scarlett has been trying very different idioms in his recent work with the Royal Ballet, so it’s disappointing that “Euphotic” is stylistically close to the ballet he made last year for these Miami dancers, “Viscera,” and musically even closer. “Viscera” was set to Lowell Liebermann’s first piano concerto; “Euphotic” is to his second. Mr. Hall’s lighting for both puts dancers sometimes into silhouette, sometimes into shade.“Euphotic,” like “Viscera,” is large-scale and insistently heterosexual: it has three lead couples, four supporting couples, and a corps of 10 women and 4 men. A central problem is that, like “Viscera,” “Euphotic” depends on overpartnering, with women being continually and meaninglessly manipulated by men. Whenever male-female partnerwork is involved, why does Mr. Scarlett (like Christopher Wheeldon, plainly a strong influence on him) make his men grip, twist, lift and spin his women nonstop?Turn from “Euphotic” to the two Balanchines, even to the “Don Quixote” number, and you see men and women making expressive use of intervening space in duets, men serving women without controlling them, and men and women dancing side by side like affectionate colleagues with mutual respect. But once a Scarlett man has a woman in his sights, he doesn’t dance, he merely manhandles.Mr. Liebermann’s concerto has four movements; onstage, each of the first three features a different woman. In the first, the ballerina gets hauled around by one man, in the second, one soloist receives more intense treatment from four men (the way they flip, throw and drop her is particularly disagreeable), and in the third, a second female soloist is continually manipulated by two men.“Euphotic” is structured so that its principal couple appears only in the first and fourth movements. Only the fourth movement brings everyone together, hierarchically and symmetrically, but the pattern that finally amalgamates these submissive women and these controlling men is more about choreography than dancing.And what of its dancers? From three casts I learned only that most (not all) of these men partner as well as Mr. Scarlett demands and that these women are very game at being their playthings. Yet you learn more about any of them from any five seconds of the Balanchine ballets.The irresistibly engaging Jeanette Delgado danced three of the program’s four lead roles, sometimes two in the same program. Mary Carmen Catoya, who shared with her the lead roles in “Divertimento No. 15” and “Don Quixote,” proved her equal in coloratura footwork and, in “Don Quixote,” showed even more relish for bravura. Among the many junior dancers on show, my eye dwelt with special gratitude on Emily Bromberg, Jennifer Lauren, Nathalia Arja and Chase Swatosh in various casts of “Divertimento No. 15” and Kleber Rebello in “Duo Concertant.” It’s always a delight to revisit the company; these dancers flood the auditorium with warmth, finesse and pride in their work."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/theater/bloomberg-the-musical-hes-not-calling-the-tunes.html,"BEGINNING on Wednesday, Encores! is bringing back “Fiorello!,” the Pulitzer Prize-winning 1959 musical about Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia, to celebrate its 20th season. “Fiorello!” was the first show to be revived at City Center in a concert staging, the Encores! format that has become a New York cultural fixture. Why that show? “La Guardia saved City Center from the wrecking ball,” explained Jack Viertel, the program’s artistic director.But it’s no coincidence that the musical is returning during the last year of Michael R. Bloomberg’s administration, he added. Like La Guardia, who led New York from 1933 to 1945, Mr. Bloomberg “is a man of short stature who casts a very long shadow,” Mr. Viertel said. “These kinds of political heroes are hard to find these days.”While “Fiorello!” is the most successful Broadway musical about a New York mayor, it’s not the only one. “Jimmy,” about La Guardia’s predecessor Jimmy Walker, had a short run in 1969, as did “Mayor,” about Edward I. Koch (sample song: “How’m I Doin’ ”), in 1985.Could Mr. Bloomberg be next? We asked three musical-theater composers to imagine song-and-dance numbers from the life of our current three-termer.‘THE LANES’Lyrics by Lynn Ahrens, who won the Tony Award for “Ragtime” and received two Academy Award nominations for “Anastasia.” Most recently she wrote lyrics for “Rocky,” which had its premiere in Hamburg in November.(Mayor Bloomberg skims through mail on his desk. One letter in particular catches his attention. As he reads, lights come up on Letter Writer No. 1, a tightly wound New York native. Can be played by a man or a woman of any age. It’s attitude that matters.)LETTER WRITER NO. 1Dear Mayor Bloomberg,Since I’m feeling somewhat betterI am writing you this letter‘Cause I thought you ought to knowYou’re my favorite politician,I support your every missionAnd I listen to 1130 on my radio.You became a triple termer.Did I ever make a murmur?No!

Mayor Bloomberg shakes his head sadly, crumples the letter and tosses it in his trash can. Lights out.)‘REQUIEM FOR THE BARFLIES’Lyrics by Joe Iconis, a winner of the 2007 Kleban Prize for Musical Theater, and the author of “The Black Suits” and “Bloodsong of Love.”Imagine an encounter between Mayor Bloomberg and the owner of a dive bar who believes that the smoking ban ruined his business. Bloomberg would wander into the bar on its last night, wanting to connect with the people of his city, but the old man who owns the bar recognizes the mayor and holds him captive.It would play like a pulpy action thriller, the kind that was shown at the grindhouses that no longer exist on 42nd Street because of the sterilization of Times Square. Perhaps another bar patron, The Large Can of Sugary Soda, would enter the bar and sing an “And I Am Telling You I’m Not Going”-style anthem of rage. The show would be a portrait of a man struggling with the effects he’s had on the people of the city he dearly loves, but disguised as a trashy musical.At this point in the musical, Ed the Salty Bar Owner has just engaged in an elaborate fight sequence with Bloomberg. Ed has regained control, and Bloomberg is once again tied up, with the wire from a broken Pabst Blue Ribbon neon sign. Ed crumples at Bloomberg’s feet and sings of faded glory:The ciggy machine in the cornerIs now but a dust collectorThe jukebox selection is strange and datedThe leather banquettes have disintegratedThe waitress turned frumpy, the rats are all jumpyIn fear of the health inspectorSo pour out the whiskeyAnd put me on iceIt’s all just a horrible jokeIt wasn’t my faultBut I’m paying the priceMy life has gone up in smokePoof! in a cloud of secondhand smokeSo cash in your mommy And padlock your popTheir legacy suffered a strokeI try to extinguishThe flames never stopNow my life has gone up in smokeSo pour out the whiskeyAnd put me on iceIt’s all just a horrible jokeIt wasn’t my faultBut I’m paying the priceMy life has gone up in smokePoof! in a cloud of secondhand smoke‘HAIL TO THE ALMOST-FIRST-LADY’Lyrics by Marcy Heisler, a winner of the 2012 Kleban Prize for Musical Theater and writer of the book and lyrics for “Ever After” and lyrics for “The Great American Mousical.” Romantic comedy should be on everyone’s agenda, mayoral and otherwise. Along those lines, lights come up on the press room, where members of the mayoral staff are having a spirited discussion about what to call the mayor’s girlfriend, Diana L. Taylor:STAFFER 1 Main squeeze?STAFFER 2 Girlfriend in chief?CHIEF OF STAFF Come on, people — we can do better than that.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/dining/king-cakes-abound-in-new-orleans.html,"NEW ORLEANS — Other cities might be trudging through cabbage season at this point in winter, but New Orleans is eating cake. From Twelfth Night to Mardi Gras, which is Feb. 12 this year, daily consumption of king cake — a round of sweet dough glazed with purple, gold and green sugar — is more or less compulsory. It’s a clue that although this city’s rémoulades and gumbos and Sazeracs are renowned, there is also a world of sweet treats to explore.“New Orleans is a sugar town, always has been,” said Dwight Henry, the owner of the Buttermilk Drop Bakery and Cafe in the Seventh Ward, who has been baking here for more than 30 years. The region has been coated in the stuff since the 18th century, when spectacular fortunes were amassed on French- and British-owned sugar plantations worked by African slaves all along the River Road between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. Women called pralinières stood streetside in Jackson Square selling pralines, creamy rounds of brown sugar studded with local pecans. When slavery ended, thousands of immigrants from Sicily took jobs in the cane fields, bringing gelato and granita and marzipan to the region.Today, the remnants of the Louisiana sugar trade are preserved here on menus, in home kitchens and in the memories of citizens whose loyalties to certain bakeries remain part of their local identity. “Whether you get your king cake at Haydel’s or Gambino’s is determined at birth,” said Amanda Hebert, a New Orleans transplant who lives in Los Angeles, referring to two longstanding rival bakeries.Seven and a half years after Hurricane Katrina devastated the city, its cuisine is thriving again, with many of the old institutions reopened — and lots of new places where the mix of French, Spanish, West African, Sicilian and German influence that formed the local palate is being deliciously reinterpreted.Because of the city’s unique culinary mix, certain sweets evolved and exist only here, the way lemurs are found only on the isolated island of Madagascar. There are 17-layer cakes called doberges, sugar-dusted rice fritters called calas and Sicilian ice creams in archaic flavors like gelsomino (jasmine) and torroncino (sugared almonds and cinnamon). There are cheap storefront pleasures like sno-balls, scoops of fluffy shaved ice soaked in only-in-New Orleans syrup flavors like nectar, pink squirrel and cream of ice cream. There are famous desserts like bananas Foster, invented at Brennan’s in 1951, and Mrs. Leah Chase’s dense peach cobbler and praline pudding at Dooky Chase; and under-the-radar diner treats like griddled pie at the Camellia Grill, where the cooks push aside burgers cooking on the flat-top to sear slices of pie in the salty fat that remains.And because New Orleans is quickly becoming one of several delicious laboratories for chefs exploring the past and future of Southern food, there are also pastry chefs making playful hybrids of these deep-rooted desserts, like the bananas Foster-flavored king cake at Domenica, king-cake-flavored macarons at Sucré, and the lemon doberge king cake at Cochon Butcher. “But only from Epiphany to Mardi Gras,” said Rhonda Ruckman, the New Orleans native who oversees the desserts there and at Cochon and Herbsaint with the chef Donald Link. “We are definitely observers of tradition.”Doberge cakes (pronounced DOUGH-bash) look ordinary — until you cut into one and reveal its many tablet-thin layers of cake and custard, stacked into a delectable mass. The cake was invented during the Great Depression by Beulah Levy Ledner, a local matron who started selling home-baked Dobos tortes to make extra money. She adapted the filling to the Louisiana climate by using custard instead of buttercream, changed the name to appeal to the region’s culinary Francophilia, and became a local legend.No momentous birthday party or bridal shower in New Orleans is held without a doberge cake, usually filled with chocolate, lemon or caramel. Mrs. Ledner eventually sold her recipe to Joseph Gambino, whose descendants still make the classic, but a new artisan doberge company is now making waves with flavors like Bloody Red Velvet and Sweet Potato Pancake.“I don’t want to do anything else but cake,” declared Charles Mary, the co-owner of Debbie Does Doberge, a tiny cottage business run by Mr. Mary with his girlfriend, Charlotte McGehee. Ms. McGehee, who has described herself as “a little O.C.D.,” has made the doberge even more complex, with eight layers of cake, pudding and fruit filling, and glass-smooth icing that enrobes the outside. The pair are just the kind of young, endearingly single-minded food entrepreneurs commonly spotted in Brooklyn and Portland, Ore., who carry a torch for tradition but yearn to express their creative urges.Arthur Brocato, who runs the ice cream and pastry business started by his grandfather Angelo Brocato in 1905, is a keeper of the Sicilian flame. In his Mid-City shop, he still makes spumoni, lemon granita, gelati and cannoli as Angelo did in Palermo, where he apprenticed as a teenager and became a master gelataio. (Arthur used to make marzipan, too, but Hurricane Katrina’s floodwaters ruined the plaster-of-paris molds that Angelo used.) St. Joseph, the patron saint of Sicily, is also the patron saint of confectioners, and St. Joseph’s Day, March 19, is a citywide holiday here, with home altars holding sweets like Mr. Brocato’s cucidati, fig cookies sprinkled with rainbow nonpareils, and biscotti regina, coated with sesame seeds.Variations on fried dough are beloved here. According to local legend (and Krispy Kreme official history), the yeast-raised beignets of New Orleans are the likely source for the “secret” Krispy Kreme doughnut recipe.At Mr. Henry’s bakery in the Seventh Ward, the main trade is in yeast-raised doughnuts and buttermilk drops, cake doughnuts the size of a baby’s fist, fried to a tobacco brown and sugar-glazed. He also makes an old-school shoe sole (a flat piece of cinnamon dough the size of a piece of paper), and he’ll even deep-fry an entire king cake to order, a style that has become popular around the city.Recently, Mr. Henry has been forced to leave his bakery occasionally — under protest, he says — to hit the film awards circuit, because of his starring role as Wink in “Beasts of the Southern Wild.” (The filmmakers became regulars at the Buttermilk Drop when shooting was under way and eventually cast him in the role, for which he won the Los Angeles Film Critics Association prize for best supporting actor.) Through the movie business, Mr. Henry met the New York City restaurateur Richard Notar, who plans to reopen the much-mourned Lenox Lounge in Harlem this spring; if all goes according to plan, Mr. Henry will open a branch of his bakery next door.So for New Yorkers and other novices, here are some king cake basics: It is a sweet ring of brioche dough streaked with cinnamon, like a coffeecake. (A note for pastry nerds; it is not descended from the buttery northern French galette des rois, but more likely from the colorful southern French gâteau des rois.)King cake is popular all over this region, but in New Orleans it is always striped with green, gold and purple sugar — the colors that represent faith, power and justice in the complex symbolism of the Mardi Gras, decreed by parade clubs or “krewes” here in the 19th century. The most traditional cakes are braided, but they can be filled with cream cheese, fruit filling, pudding or all of the above. (A local actor, Lawrence Beron, stars in a series of YouTube videos mocking the competitive excess of king cake bakeries.)Since almost no one bakes king cake at home, bakers say a solid annual trade has helped keep them going after Katrina.Today, the city has a host of variations. At Sucré, the chef Tariq Hanna has tamed the cake’s undeniable gaudiness, draping it in pastel shades of spray sugar; his filling is also one of the best in town. At Cochon Butcher in the Warehouse district, Ms. Ruckman makes fat individual cakes filled with a fresh apple compote and house-made Creole cream cheese — a fluffy, farmer-style local specialty. This year one of the largest krewes, Zulu, has designated an official king cake of its own, filled with coconut.Most important, each king cake conceals a bite-size figurine, usually of a baby that traditionally represents Jesus. (The year after Katrina, Haydel’s Bakery made them in the shape of a FEMA trailer.) Whoever finds the baby in his slice has to hold the next party and buy the next cake — thus, the continuity of king cake season is preserved. “My mama would get so mad at us if we got the baby,” Mr. Henry said, smiling as he remembered his childhood in the Lower Ninth Ward. “King cake was expensive back then.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/sports/hockey/rangers-beat-flyers-and-move-to-500-on-the-season.html,"It was not pretty, as Michael Del Zotto attested after he scored one goal and set up another in the Rangers’ 2-1 victory over the Philadelphia Flyers at Madison Square Garden on Tuesday. But, as he added, the Rangers found a way to win.Finding a way to win was something the Rangers “did a great job of last year,” Del Zotto said. True. It was also true that this one was not pretty.The Rangers barely escaped with the win and lost their captain, Ryan Callahan, with an undisclosed injury to his left arm or shoulder. They also took “way too many penalties,” as Coach John Tortorella put it, giving up six power plays but killing five.Tortorella seemed more concerned with the excessive penalties than with how the Rangers killed them off. “I focus on the dumbness of Hagelin,” Tortorella said, adding that while he played a great game, it was “washed out by dumbness.”The reference was to forward Carl Hagelin, who led the Rangers with four shots on goal but who also caused a too-many-men-on-the-ice penalty in the third period.The victory lifted the Rangers to 3-3 and put them at .500 for the first time this season. It also avenged a listless 2-1 loss in Philadelphia last Thursday.But it could come at a cost. Callahan missed the last 15 minutes of the game. He skated off the ice clutching his left arm after wrestling with the Flyers’ Max Talbot in a pointless post-whistle scrum, for which both players received roughing penalties.Earlier, Callahan scored a goal for his 200th career point.Del Zotto was superb over the game’s first 40 minutes. He scored in the first, his second goal in two games, added an assist on Callahan’s goal and continued his emergence as the Rangers’ best attacking defenseman.“There’s no question Michael’s biggest asset is joining the rush,” Tortorella said before the game. “He’s tending to stand still a little bit with the puck — we want him moving with the puck also. But he’s had a good start. He’s still just a very young kid in this game.”Del Zotto did not stand still much Tuesday. He shrugged off a tremendous body check from Zac Rinaldo and calmly skated away with the puck, drew a key penalty, ran smooth breakouts from the Rangers’ end and jumped into the attack consistently.Del Zotto opened the scoring 1 minute 57 seconds into the game. Philadelphia defenseman Andreas Lilja practically handed the puck to Benn Ferriero in the Flyers’ end. Ferriero passed it back to Del Zotto, whose slap shot from 57 feet, low and along the ice, beat Flyers goalie Ilya Bryzgalov to the near post.“It’s not like the shot was a bomb or anything,” Del Zotto said. “It was a seeing-eye shot — nice when they go in.”It was Del Zotto’s second goal of the season. He was belatedly credited with the Rangers’ fourth goal in the 5-2 victory against Toronto on Saturday night, a goal originally credited to Brian Boyle.It was also Ferriero’s first point as a Ranger, in only his second game with the club.At 11:31 of the second period, Del Zotto assisted on Callahan’s goal, a rare man-advantage strike for the Rangers. Their power play, which started the game at 2 for 22, is now at 3 for 24.Del Zotto was the Ranger who created the power play when he was tripped by Talbot at 11:02.But the Flyers drew to within 2-1 on a power-play goal from Kimmo Timonen at 7:09 of the third period, after the Rangers were caught with too many men on the ice because of Hagelin’s gaffe.Over all, though, the Rangers’ penalty killers played well. That included killing off 1:17 of a two-man advantage in the second period. Despite never clearing their zone once during that stretch, the three penalty killers — Ryan McDonagh, Dan Girardi and Jeff Halpern — allowed only two shots on goalie Henrik Lundqvist, who stopped 26 in all.“I’m getting more and more comfortable,” said Lundqvist, who boosted his season save percentage to .905 from .893. “I’m getting there.”With Callahan gone for the final 15 minutes, the Rangers hung in and staved off the Flyers, whose record fell to 2-5.“A guy like Cally does everything so well, especially blocking shots, and leads by example,” Del Zotto said. “The guys did a good job of gathering themselves after he went off with that injury.”The Rangers’ shutdown defensemen shone in the third period. Girardi played almost 11 minutes. McDonagh played almost 12 and led all players with 30:09 for the game.It was enough to save the win for the Rangers."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/world/africa/nigeria-money-promised-to-clean-up-lead-that-killed-hundreds-of-children.html,"President Goodluck Jonathan promised this week to release $4 million to clean up villages where hundreds of children have died in the world’s worst outbreak of lead poisoning.Health activists applauded the move, saying it could save thousands of lives. More than 400 children have died from lead released by wildcat gold-mining in seven villages in Zamfara State, according to Doctors Without Borders, one of several agencies working there. An additional 1,500 children have high lead levels, which can cause brain damage and other problems.Local gold-bearing rock is also high in lead, which gets into the air, soil and water when villagers grind it and melt it. Many villagers took up mining as the price of gold soared to $1,800 an ounce last year, although the government has banned home mining.The cleanup money has been blocked since 2011; the decision to release it “could be lifesaving for countless children,” Jane Cohen, a researcher from Human Rights Watch, said in a statement."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/business/media/vegetables-in-winter-served-family-style.html,"BIRDS EYE, the frozen vegetable brand, will introduce new TV advertising for its Steamfresh Chef’s Favorites side dishes on Feb. 4, the first work by its latest ad agency, BBDO.Timed to coincide with peak consumption of frozen vegetables, the new campaign comes during a period of flat growth for the category.According to the SymphonyIRI Group, dollar sales of all frozen vegetables in United States supermarkets, drugstores and mass market retailers grew only 0.05 percent in the year ending Dec. 30, 2012, to $3.02 billion, compared with 3.3 percent growth in dollar sales in the year ending Jan. 1, 2012.Dollar sales of Birds Eye, which generated almost one-quarter of all 2012 dollar sales, declined 1.1 percent last year, compared with a 3.4 percent drop in dollar sales by Green Giant, which generated 18 percent of all dollar sales, the SymphonyIRI Group also said.Birds Eye, a brand of Pinnacle Foods, previously worked with the New York office of TBWA, part of the Omnicom Group, which last year created new advertising that depicted a vegetable harvest at a picturesque farm in the midst of a snowstorm, urging viewers to “discover the wonder of Birds Eye.”The latest campaign, by the New York office of BBDO, another Omnicom unit, shows how mothers — in this case, mothers of dolphin, wolf and bear families, brought to life through the use of voice-overs — complete family meals by serving Steamfresh Chef’s Favorites side dishes. These dishes contain bite-size pieces of foods and are aimed at families with children age 6 to 11.Rodrigo Troni, senior vice president for marketing at Birds Eye, said the brand — which was bought by Pinnacle Foods, owned by the Blackstone Group, in 2009 — had decided to switch to BBDO, which also works with Pinnacle Foods’ Duncan Hines and Vlasic brands, “to consolidate with one major agency.”Although the TBWA campaign “helped the category show how relevant it is, that it’s always vegetable season,” Birds Eye now wants to “connect with consumers in terms of usage,” Mr. Troni said.To that end, the three new 15-second TV spots are based on research by Birds Eye that found that “moms have an everyday dinner dilemma,” Mr. Troni said, adding they “want to serve a complete meal more often, a meal that’s nutritionally better, tastes great and is emotionally satisfying for the mother, who doesn’t have time to cook.”To illustrate this concept, Tim Bayne, an executive creative director in the New York office of BBDO, said the agency had decided that instead of depicting a human family at a dinner table, “watching them react to delicious vegetables, which we’ve seen a thousand times, we thought we’d just have fun with the family part. We needed carnivores that had a little cuteness to them, the kid animals had to be cute.”One spot depicts a dolphin family underwater, with the mother saying she was considering serving rotini and broccoli with cheese sauce with fish for dinner.In another spot, a bear family fishes for salmon in a river; the mother says she will serve Asian medley with it for dinner. A third spot features a wolf family, in which the father asks the mother what she is serving with chicken at dinner that night; she replies potatoes and green beans.All spots end with the announcer urging viewers to “turn vegetables you want to serve into vegetables they want to eat. Birds Eye, now dinner’s complete.”They will appear, starting on Feb. 4, on cable networks like the Food Network, the Cooking Channel, Lifetime, OWN, TBS and TNT. Similar digital advertising will break in March.Mr. Troni said the budget for the new campaign would exceed $10 million through 2013. According to Kantar Media, the brand spent $17.6 million on advertising in 2011, and $6.4 million in the first nine months of 2012, compared with $11.4 million in the same period in 2011.Green Giant spent $13 million in the first nine months of 2012, up from $9.8 million in the same period in 2011, Kantar Media said. Green Giant introduced a major new campaign late last year.Birds Eye’s advertising received mixed reviews from industry observers.Patti Williams, an associate professor of marketing at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania, called the campaign a continuation of the brand’s recent efforts to promote healthy eating by children through an agreement with Partnership for a Healthier America and collaboration with “iCarly,” the Nickelodeon show.Birds Eye, she said, is recognizing that “parents know they need to make healthier food choices for their children and that they continue to find that a challenge.”Tom Meyvis, an associate professor of marketing at the Stern School of Business at New York University, said he doubted that “parents would find the ads credible” because “kids are not so excited about eating steamed vegetables.”He added: “A better approach would be to connect to reality at the beginning of the ad, with kids bored with their vegetables. They could then show a meal complete with vegetables, now with the kids excited.”Larry Finkel, director of food and beverage research for MarketResearch.com, said that although the new spots “pepper in a kid-pleasing product, with characters with funny voices, the agency did an amateurish job in execution.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/arts/dance/audience-ready-to-play-your-part.html,"For Claude Wampler, subterfuge isn’t a fashionable artistic device. She needs it.An artist who specializes in visual art and performance, Ms. Wampler shrouds her work in mystery in order to defy audience expectations. At the Kitchen in 2006 she unveiled “Performance (Career Ender),” in which rock musicians, whose images were projected onto the stage through a haze of fog, rehearsed while planted audience members reacted with deranged glee. For Ms. Wampler choreography doesn’t just mean movement — though it’s there — but also the arrangement of a highly detailed series of events.Even though “Career Ender” was met with critical acclaim, Ms. Wampler thought the production would be the end of her theatrical affair. “It just felt like I had worked something out as far as why live performance works or doesn’t work,” she said in a recent interview. “It completed something for me.”But she had a change of heart. “Making performance is like creating Christmas for your kids,” she said. “I realized, if I think about performance as manufacturing memories, then I’ve got some more work to do.”Ms. Wampler, 46, may have called “Career Ender” her farewell to performance — in the title the word “performance” was crossed out — but she actually never stopped putting on shows. In her most recent sculpture series, she displayed pedestals and shadows, but no objects.“I’m removing the art to see how far I can go to make something appear without the materiality of the thing itself,” she said. “If I can create the image of the sculpture in the mind of the audience, without the sculpture actually being there, that’s much more interesting than just showing the sculpture.”For that show, Ms. Wampler used the tools of performance. Audience plants discussed the objects as if they were there, and museum guards pretended that the sculptures existed.“I don’t manipulate an audience in a negative sense,” she said. “I manipulate an audience in the best way possible, which is to assist them in the act of looking, of observing.”Starting on Thursday, she’s back at the Kitchen with “N’a Pas un Gramme de Charisme” (“There Is Not One Gram of Charisma”), which she describes as a collaboration with the filmmaker and performer Amelia Saul. John Tremblay will contribute set pieces; Antonius Wiriadjaja is the show’s technical wizard. Her title is taken from a French magazine’s review of Katie Holmes’s performance as Jacqueline Kennedy in the 2011 television mini-series “The Kennedys.”“I think it’s quite an achievement to not have one gram of charisma,” Ms. Wampler said. “How does she do it? And then I watched it, and it’s true. She’s like Keanu Reeves in that way — she’s a very attractive placeholder for the character. I love Keanu because of that. Somebody who could have such a career and be completely and utterly free of talent is so awesome.”Ms. Wampler said she was thinking about absence  in the work. “The new piece is an exploration of what do people want in the moment of performance, and what are they bringing to it that informs how they watch it?” she asked. “I’m trying to understand the audience before they get there.”One way to clear the mind of an audience is to say nothing about the piece. Another way is to reveal a lot. But Ms. Wampler has devised a third possibility.“You can’t buy tickets: you have to be invited or recommended,” she said. “We’re going to give people what we’re calling ‘leaks of material’ before they get to the show itself.”Prospective audience members may request an invitation by visiting the Web site pascharisme.com. After purchasing a ticket, they will receive the leaks — whether video, audio or something else —  via e-mail. The leaks are a way for Ms. Wampler to try to manage how the audience experiences her show.“It’s a way to plant seeds so that they sprout in the right way,” she said. “We’ll see how it works. It’s all experimentation.”And, as in her previous works, Ms. Wampler is in complete control. “The Wampler secrecy even extends to me, and I’m the closest collaborator,” Ms. Saul said. “She’ll tell me to do things: copy that, learn that song, watch this, read that. And I’ll do all them and be incredibly inspired, and then nothing will come of it.”Recently Ms. Wampler told Ms. Saul that she had written out the final version of the show. Ms. Saul was excited, until she read through it; in one section the word “movement” was written with no further details.“She is still holding back,” Ms. Saul said with a sigh. “Great. I love movement I can move.”Ms. Wampler, raised in Pennsylvania, may not call herself a choreographer but she does think choreographically. From age 8 to 16, she studied ballet and the Graham technique. After focusing on theater, she moved to Japan to study Butoh with Yoko Ashikawa, a muse of Tatsumi Hijikata, who was one of that dance form’s founders.There, Ms. Wampler’s life took a crazy turn. Upon her arrival at Ms. Ashikawa’s company, she says she was locked in a room. “They were afraid that I was going to steal their information if I was let in on any of it.”In the end, she did manage to stay and was trained, lasting for two and a half years, and she is grateful for something Ms. Ashikawa passed on.“She taught me not to be all matchy-matchy,” she said, referring to pairing compatible tones or styles. “America is so matchy-matchy. With her work, we would be doing these movements, and she would play ‘Sunshiny Day,’ and you immediately start opening up and becoming all Western and reachy — and then you would get smacked. The broom would come down.”She laughed and continued, “I realized this movement doesn’t have to go with that — separate events can happen simultaneously.”That twisted sensibility continues in her own work.Yet “N’a Pas un Gramme de Charisme” is a new adventure, and for it she is resisting her usual technique of incorporating audience plants. “I can’t really do that anymore,” Ms. Wampler said. “What’s fun is that I don’t even have to put them there anymore, because everybody gets this paranoid feeling that the person next to them is a plant. Everybody becomes visible in a way that they weren’t before.”Ms. Wampler paused for a moment. “Well, actually, there’s one plant that I’ve always used whenever I show my work in New York, and that’s RoseLee,” she said, referring to RoseLee Goldberg, the performance-art writer and director of the Performa biennial. “I’m not going to fire her for this one.”But that could be another Wampler trick."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/arts/music/butch-morris-dies-at-65-creator-of-conduction.html,"Butch Morris, who created a distinctive form of large-ensemble music built on collective improvisation that he single-handedly directed and shaped, died on Tuesday in Brooklyn. He was 65.The cause was cancer, said Kim Smith, his publicist and friend. Mr. Morris, who lived in the East Village, died at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Fort Hamilton.Mr. Morris referred to his method as “conduction,” short for “conducted improvisation.” He defined the word, which he trademarked, as “an improvised duet for ensemble and conductor.”He would often begin a performance by setting a tempo with his baton and having his musicians develop a theme spontaneously and then seize on the musical ideas he wanted to work with, directing the ensemble with a vocabulary of gestures and signals. An outstretched upward palm, up or down to indicate volume, meant sustain; a U shape formed with thumb and forefinger meant repeat; a finger to the forehead meant to remember a melodic phrase or a rhythm that he would summon again later.He introduced this concept in 1985 and at first met resistance from musicians who were not willing to learn the vocabulary and respond to the signals; he was often in a position of asking artists to reorient themselves to his imagination and make something new out of familiar materials. But he demanded to be taken seriously, and he was. After 10 years he had made enough recordings to release “Testament,” a well-received 10-disc set of his work. After 20, he had become an internationally admired creative force, presenting conductions at concert halls worldwide and maintaining regular workshops and performances at the East Village spaces Nublu, Lucky Cheng’s and the Stone.Mr. Morris, who also played cornet, began his career as a jazz musician in Los Angeles. After settling in New York in the early 1980s, he took his place among both the downtown improvising musicians of the Kitchen and the Knitting Factory and the purveyors of multidisciplinary, mixed-media art flourishing in the city.Though the bulk of his conductions were with those trained in jazz or new music, many different kinds of performers could take part, as long as they had learned his method. (Five days of rehearsal was his preference.) Conduction No. 1, “Current Trends in Racism in Modern America,” was performed in 1985, at the Kitchen, with a 10-piece ensemble including the saxophonists John Zorn and Frank Lowe, the turntablist Christian Marclay and the composer Yasunao Tone. Others were for full classical orchestras; electronic instruments and music boxes; dancers, actors and visual artists; and gatherings of 19 poets (No. 27) or 15 trumpets (No. 134).Mr. Morris occasionally used written music or texts, by himself or others — he did this with the saxophonist David Murray’s big band and octet in the early 1990s, and in more recent years with the group Burnt Sugar, an ensemble influenced by his methods, for which he conducted a version of Stravinsky’s “Rite of Spring” — but most often he used no written material at all.In decades of workshops around the world, and for a stretch, from 1998 to 2001, at Bilgi University in Istanbul, he taught his signals and gestures. Some of these were common to all conductors; some were adapted from the California jazz bandleaders Horace Tapscott and Charles Moffett, whom he had known early in his career (he also cited Sun Ra, Lukas Foss and “Four Improvisations by the Orchestra’' recorded  by the New York Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein’s direction as influences); many were his own.He said he didn’t care whether people thought his music was jazz or not, although he himself saw it as derived from jazz but not beholden to it. “As long as I’m a black man playing a cornet,” he reasoned, “I’ll be a jazz musician in other people’s eyes. That’s good enough for me. There’s nothing wrong with being called a jazz musician.”Lawrence Douglas Morris was born in Long Beach, Calif., on Feb. 10, 1947, and grew up in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles. The son of a career Navy man, he played trumpet in school orchestra, and after high school copied big-band arrangements for a Los Angeles music studio. In 1966 he served in the Army, as a medic in Germany, Vietnam and Japan. Once back home, he joined Mr. Tapscott’s big band, a creative and social hub in the Los Angeles experimental-jazz scene.After studying music at Grove Street College in Oakland, Calif., he briefly moved to New York. In 1976 he left to play and teach music in France and the Netherlands. In 1981 he relocated permanently to New York, not long after his brother Wilber, the bassist through the 1980s and early ’90s in David Murray’s octet, did.Wilber Morris died in 2002. Mr. Morris is survived by a son, Alexandre; a brother Michael; and a sister, Marceline. His marriage to Therese Christophe ended in divorce last year.Conduction, with all its logistical complications and no institutional system to support it, was never a steady source of income. Mr. Morris also taught and sought commissions; he wrote music for dancers, including Min Tanaka, Diane McIntyre and Yoshiko Chuma; he worked as musical director for the short-lived ABC crime series “A Man Called Hawk”; he wrote original music for Ntozake Shange’s play “Spell #7” and for the Wooster Group and the Folger Shakespeare Theater in Washington.One of his projects, in the early 1990s, was writing music for windup music boxes, for which he asked visual artists he knew — including David Hammons, A. R. Penck, Betye and Alison Saar, and Michael Hafftka — to create the outer shells. But he insisted that the artists not think of them as music boxes. “I tell them, ‘I don’t want to think in terms of boxes,’ ” he explained. “I want to think of them as resonating containers.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/arts/music/christine-andreas-in-bemused-at-54-below.html,"“Bemused,” the title of the singer Christine Andreas’s deliciously tangy show at 54 Below, is one of the most misused and hard-to-pin-down words in the English language. As Ms. Andreas reflected on its meanings at Sunday evening’s opening-night performance, one synonym, “thunderstruck,” stood out.For her, she said, it evokes the explosive chemistry when a singer or composer and the right song collide. That would describe Judy Garland and “Get Happy!”; Ethel Waters and “Happiness Is a Thing Called Joe”; Astrud Gilberto and any song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim; Richard Harris and the songs of Jimmy Webb; and “those very bad boys” Frank Sinatra (with, in her words, his “Jack Daniel’s-soaked heart”) and Jimmy Van Heusen.The show’s least-known magical connection was Vivienne Segal and two Rodgers and Hart songs, “To Keep My Love Alive,” from the 1943 revival of “A Connecticut Yankee,” and “Bewitched, Bothered, and Bewildered,” from “Pal Joey.” “To Keep My Love Alive,” the confessions of a serial murderer as to how she dispatched several flawed husbands, Ms. Andreas delivered with a mischievous glee. Her extremely sexy version of “Bewitched” revolved around the words “I’m a rich, ready, ripe juicy plum again.”Ms. Andreas, 61, might be described as a recovering ingénue. The days are long gone when she starred on Broadway in revivals of “My Fair Lady” and “Oklahoma!,” but her beauty and radiance remain undimmed. Her bright, shiny soprano, with its wheeling vibrato and metallic edge, conveys a high-strung emotionality that is sharpened by her acting skills.Her musicians, the pianist Don Rebic and the bassist Dick Sarpola, maintained a low profile in refined pop-jazz arrangements that encouraged Ms. Andreas to fly as far and wide as she wished. As the evening progressed, her phrasing became increasingly emphatic and at moments almost feisty.Of all the connections Ms. Andreas made, the most exciting, if unlikely, was with Édith Piaf in a Parisian section that began with “I Love Paris,” declaimed as an anthem. There was nothing demure about her full-bodied renditions of “Milord” and “La Vie en Rose.” She might as well have been standing at the barricades."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/30/books/whose-toes-are-those-by-sally-symes-and-more.html,"GOOD NIGHT!By Benoit Marchon.Illustrated by Soledad Bravi.40 pp. HMH Books. $7.99. (Board book; ages 0 to 3)SPOONFUL!By Benoit Marchon.Illustrated by Soledad Bravi.38 pp. HMH Books. $7.99. (Board book; ages 0 to 3)Published in France in 2006, these two delightful die-cut books are a most welcome import. Both pursue a simple repetitive theme. Each page in “Good Night!” bids an evening farewell to a different creature, and each page in “Spoonful!” offers a mouthful of food (unspecified) to a person or animal. Bilingual families and Francophile parents will especially enjoy the cultural illuminations, often inadvertent, rendered by the translation. “Good Night” presents typical French terms of endearment, including some not used by American parents. We do not, for example, commonly refer to our little ones as “fleas” (translated here as “little bug”). Neither do we call our children “cream puffs” (here labeled “dumplings”; though the drawing of a scrumptious, sugar-laced choux, doesn’t quite correspond).Not that it matters. Simple, tactile and clever, these delicious little books will appeal to babies grappling with their many colorful cut-out pages — and there are many; the books are considerably longer than most American board books — as well as to 3-year-olds snuggling down with a parent at bedtime.THE NOISY BOOKWritten and illustrated by Soledad Bravi.116 pp. Gecko Press. $16.95. (Board book; ages 0 to 4)Rich and original (two words not typically associated with the often merely-a-downsized-picture-book genre), this gem will delight parents as much as it does young children, partly because it’s not as simple as it looks despite the straightforward this-sounds-like-that format. Many of the pages do indeed follow the usual formula: “The bee goes buzzzzzzz.” “The goat goes maaaaa,” “The dog goes woof woof.” But there are unexpected pairings as well: A picture of a tissue box sits next to “The cold goes aachoo.” An open can of greens: “The spinach goes yuck yum.” A gastropod: “A snail does nothing but move its elegant feelers.” And, in case there’s any doubt: “The power outlet goes NO!”Soledad Bravi, the gifted illustrator behind “Spoonful!” and “Good Night!,” conjures not only noise, but also movement: “The blocks go clackerty clack” as they fall down. “Mother goes kiss kiss” while planting her lips on a smiling baby cheek. Animals are shown mid-flight and galumph. Bells tremble, a hand loudly claps and a raindrop goes “plop.” In places the translation, from the French, yields onomatopoetic effects that depart from our own. But even as they throw the reader off a bit, they also make the sounds new (and in some cases, improved). Nothing is static in this lively not-so-little book.SNOW RABBIT, SPRING RABBITA Book of Changing Seasons.Written and illustrated by Il Sung Na.24 pp. Alfred A. Knopf. $6.99. (Board book; ages 2 to 4)This picture book by Il Sung Na (“A Book of Sleep”) is well suited to the board book format. While some visual detail gets lost on the smaller pages, the minimal text and simple seasonal story are just right for the board book’s audience. As we noted in a review in 2011, when the book was first published, “‘Whimsy’ is a word that runs rampant in the description of children’s literature, but Il Sung Na’s picture books certainly merit the label.” Here, “each page’s pictures advance the spare text, which is geared toward toddlers and young preschoolers, though the visuals may yet inspire an artistically minded kindergartner. Textures are embellished with paisley patterns, woven into a bear’s fur. Turtle shells are embossed with curlicue doodles. The bunny’s cheeks are colored with a thumbprint of blush, her inquisitive eyes rimmed in the palest pink.” It’s a lovely way to welcome in spring.SPOT THE ANIMALSA Lift-the-Flap Book of Colors.Written by the American Museum of Natural History.Illustrated by Steve Jenkins.16 pp. Sterling. $6.95. (Board book; ages 2 to 4)Jenkins is a prolific author and illustrator of children’s nonfiction, most notably books about science and nature (he has illustrated both a New York Times Best Illustrated Book and a Caldecott Honor winner). He may be the ideal fit for this series, produced in conjunction with the American Museum of Natural History. The lift-the-flaps with peekaboo die-cuts in unexpected shapes hint at the animals beneath, glimpsed in their natural habitats .Using vibrant, seemingly fantastical hues, Jenkins rarely resorts to the generic animal or the usual cast of characters. His animals are accurately depicted, neither cartoonized nor cutesified. They are refreshingly specific, too: A crab is no mere crab but instead a “ghost crab,” a bright-red creature that hides behind a phalanx of beach grass. A bug is a “giant stink bug.” And a fish is a “yellow tang.” Handsomely designed and durably sturdy, this is a book nature-loving children will snatch out of the hands of their younger siblings, eager to study the rainbow of creatures featured in its highly tactile pages.NOT THAT TUTU!By Michelle Sinclair Colman.Illustrated by Hiroe Nakata.20 pp. Robin Corey Books. $7.99. (Board book; ages 2 to 4)Every season is the same, no matter how many glorious Mini Boden ensembles or Hanna Andersson play dresses you buy. A little girl wants to wear what she wants to wear — again and again and again. (The author of “Urban Babies Wear Black” plainly has a child of her own who has moved on to the next stage.) So it is with weary recognition that parents will read the first page of this board-book original: “Taylor loved her tutu. She wore it everywhere.” (Substitute Cinderella costume/sparkly pink top/purple pullover here.) Taylor wears her tutu to school and to swimming, to sled and to bed, to the chagrin of everyone else in her family. Hiroe Nakata’s illustrations are bright and appealing and the little swatch of tulle on the cover will impress Fancy Nancys in training. In the end, Taylor does take her tutu off — but what comes next isn’t quite what her parents intended.THANK YOU TREES!By Gail Langer Karwoski and Marilyn E. Gootman.Illustrated by Kristen Balouch.12 pp. Kar-Ben Publishing. $5.95. (Board book; ages 2 to 4)This charming celebration of Tu B’Shevat marries Jewish tradition with contemporary environmentalism in a celebration of trees, reflecting the way the winter holiday is celebrated today in much of Israel. “On Tu B’Shevat/We thank each tree/For all it gives/To you and me.” The art and the rhyming text are carefully pitched to a very young reader. Even the youngest will glean new appreciation for and respect of the environment: “Recycle paper,/ show you care./Weed and water./Do your share.” Kristen Balouch’s jolly collage-like illustrations, done in a vaguely ’70s palette, have lots of orange, olive and faded blue. The backgrounds are a faux wood grain, which reinforces the book’s celebratory tree-hugging.POLAR BEAR NIGHTBy Lauren Thompson.Illustrated by Stephen Savage.32 pp. Cartwheel Books. $8.99. (Board book; ages 2 to 5)Timed with the release of a follow-up picture book, “Polar Bear Morning,” this board version of the first polar bear story from Thompson and Savage has a pleasingly soft cover, its contours well tailored to the comfy bedtime story told inside. Janet Zarem, reviewing it in 2004, wrote, “Perhaps the biggest challenge for a bedtime story is to teach children that darkness can be a friend. ‘Polar Bear Night’’ meets that challenge. During the long arctic winter a cub leaves the coziness of her den. Curious and fearless, she explores ‘the snow and sky and sea and ice.’ She discovers a world of frozen beauty and contented sleepers — seals, whales and a walrus — sheltered by shadows and falling stars.” Zarem went on to note: “In a world becoming ever noisier, ever more distracting and awash in artificial light, silence and darkness are gifts we can give to ourselves and our children. ‘Polar Bear Night’ celebrates these valuable gifts and offers us yet one more, embodied in its final word: ‘home.’” Happily, neither art nor readability is sacrificed in this attractive new edition.LICK!Written and illustrated by Matthew Van Fleet.14 pp. Paula Wiseman Books. $9.99. (Board book; ages 2 to 5)A follow-up to “Sniff,” Matthew Van Fleet’s latest mini-interactive book has the high quality of his splendid pop-ups for older readers. Each page features a lineup of animals, emphasizing tongue and taste accompanied by touch-and-feel elements like a tacky surface for a frog’s fly-catcher: “Tiger tongue scratchy, Bear tongue slick, Hippo tongue squishy, Frog tongue sticks!” The cardboard is sturdy enough to endure repeated jerking by toddler hands, and the construction capable enough to ensure that tabs function smoothly. (Not a minor issue when it comes to easily frustrated 3-year-old readers.) The photographs in Van Fleet’s books for older readers (“Dog,” “Moo”) have been replaced with simple, lightly cartoonish illustrations — each of them age-appropriate and amiable. Despite the subject’s potential gross-out subject matter, there’s little to dislike in this introductory sensory experience.WHOSE TOES ARE THOSE?By Sally Symes.Illustrated by Nick Sharratt.22 pp. Candlewick Press. $4.99. (Board book; ages 3 to 5)“Whose tail? Whose toes? Whose twitchy nose?” These questions won’t be too hard to answer when the parts at stake are peeking out behind a big chunk of cheese. But children, so used to being flummoxed, feel good when they know all the answers. Each spread features a fold-over flap with three questions hiding an animal somewhere within an eye-poppingly bright background. While the responses to this particular guessing game may be predictable, it shouldn’t lessen the fun or satisfaction. Easy rhymes and simple repetitive text make this second book by Symes and Sharratt, who worked together on “Yawn,” a predictable preschool winner. There’s nothing especially new here, but it’s well executed. And it ends, sweetly, with a baby — tails are replaced with fingers as the book comes round, full circle, to the reader."

Helen Mirren, left, portrays Rachel Singer, a celebrated Mossad operative who, with two other agents; her ex-husband, Stephan Gold (Tom Wilkinson); and David Peretz (Ciaran Hinds), captured and killed the Mengele-like Nazi fugitive Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen). Eventually the accepted account of Rachel’s actions begins to erode. Jessica Chastain, Marton Csokas and Sam Worthington play the agents as young adults. “The claustrophobic, unspoken bonds and rivalries that link Rachel, David and Stephan in their younger and older incarnations are overshadowed by Vogel and everything he represents, and a finely observed study of desire under duress gives way to a breathless and pedestrian globe-trotting thriller,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times. “Not a bad one, it should be said.”7 P.M.

The malfunctioning batteries were sent to the airline’s maintenance department for service — not to the maker, GS Yuasa. (The battery from the plane involved in an emergency landing earlier this month was, however, sent back to GS Yuasa.)•An article on Tuesday about the royalties paid by streaming music companies like Spotify gave an incorrect estimate of the potential earnings of a song on Spotify’s paid tier. Spotify generally pays 0.5 to 0.7 cent a stream for the paid tier, which results in $5,000 to $7,000 per million plays, not $5,000 to $8,000.

While he is a leader of the party and its candidate for chancellor, he is not the head of the party. (That person is Sigmar Gabriel, the party chairman.) The article also described voting procedures in Germany incorrectly. Voters in most German states — but not all — cast two votes in local elections, one for a candidate and the second for a party.NEW YORKAn article in some editions on Monday about the arrest of a New Jersey man accused of possessing stolen goods, including a century-old artifact from Seoul, misstated part of the history of Korea in some copies.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/arts/music/sharon-clark-at-the-metropolitan-room.html,"You can’t underestimate the transformation of what seems like an ordinary song when an interpreter like Sharón Clark, a Washington-based jazz and soul diva, tears it apart and peers inside. A prime example in her show “Blame It on My Youth,” at the Metropolitan Room on Monday evening, was her ruminative interpretation of the old Carpenters’ hit, “Rainy Days and Mondays,” supported by Chris Grasso on piano, Tony Jefferson on drums and Neal Miner on bass.This wistful, breezily-paced car-radio hit from the early 1970s suddenly became a contemplation of chronic depression and the friendship that provides tentative consolation. Even more probing was a version of “Don’t Misunderstand,” from the 1972 movie, “Shaft’s Big Score,” whose fatalistic narrator warns a casual lover, “We are only strangers on our way to somewhere else.” Had Billie Holiday lived long enough, I would like to imagine she would have seized it.Ms. Clark’s sound, however, evokes not Holiday but rather a less operatic Sarah Vaughan fused with the more animated side of Shirley Horn, a singer who also liked to take her time. Ms. Clark’s voice is rich, her phrasing unfussy, her jazz embellishments minimal.The lighter numbers in this program of songs that Ms. Clark heard while growing up, included hits for the Beatles (“And I Love Him,” “Do You Want to Know a Secret?”) and Herman’s Hermits (a swinging “I’m Into Something Good”). A current of salty humor infused unlikely selections like “Give a Little Whistle,” from “Pinocchio,” in which that whistle became a sly sexual invitation, and best of all “Handy Man,” in which she took the role of a neighborhood stud using his equipment “24 hours a day” to fix broken hearts."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/movies/awardsseason/animation-basks-in-oscar-spotlight.html,"LOS ANGELES — At one minute 45 seconds, with credits, “Fresh Guacamole“ is the briefest film ever nominated for an Oscar. It’s a stop-motion short in which that popular avocado dish is remade with different ingredients, starting with a grenade in place of the avocado. The short, made by an animator known as PES, is a sequel of sorts to “Western Spaghetti,” a stop-motion recipe of pickup sticks pasta and Rubik’s cube garlic. It’s the first film PES, born Adam Pesapane, submitted for Oscar consideration, a process that presented some challenges for a filmmaker whose work usually lives on YouTube.“You have to jump through some hoops” to get a theatrical screening, as required by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, Mr. Pesapane said in an interview on Tuesday from his home in Santa Monica, Calif. The film, commissioned by Showtime, had its premiere before “The Artist” at a Hollywood theater last year and was programmed by the Laemmle Theaters, an art-house chain here. Despite its brevity and deceptively simple concept the short took four months, upward of $50,000 and a team of technical experts to create. “The guys who did ‘The Dark Knight Rises,’ the Bane mask, painted all the stuff for this film,” Mr. Pesapane said.With a career as a commercial director, Mr. Pesapane, 39, who is working on a feature-length project or two — an adaptation of the Garbage Pail Kids series may get off the ground first — said he hoped the Oscar nomination for his micro-opus would help him gain Hollywood momentum. Thanks to a recent rule change this year the entire membership of the Academy is invited to vote on entries in the short-film categories. (The Oscar-nominated shorts, animated and live action, open theatrically on Friday.)“You can’t get any higher award for making short films, let alone minute-and-40 second films,” PES said. In place of the usual “For Your Consideration” ads that studios run touting their films, he and his wife and collaborator, Sarah Phelps, had another slogan idea: “For Your Amusement.”While no one was looking, this year’s Oscars have become a hotbed for animation lovers. For starters an animator, Seth MacFarlane, a creator of “Family Guy” and “The Cleveland Show,” is hosting the ceremony on Feb. 24. There are 5 nominees for best animated film — usually there are three — reflecting a record 21 such features up for consideration this season. (There were also more contenders in the shorts categories.) Collectively the full-length Oscar hopefuls have made more than $542 million at the box office, mostly thanks to Pixar/Disney’s “Brave,” a rebel princess story with a bow-and-arrow-shooting heroine, and “Wreck-It Ralph,” a pop culture mash-up of retro video games and cartoons. The other three nominees are done in stop-motion, an old animation form that rarely crops up so frequently in one year.“When we did ‘The Nightmare Before Christmas’ in 1993, a stop-motion feature was pretty much unheard-of,” said Tim Burton, whose “Frankenweenie,” using the same technique, is a nominee this year. It is based on a live-action short he made in 1984, when he was briefly an animator at Disney. “Though even in the ’80s Rick Heinrichs,” his production designer, “and I pitched it as a stop-motion film,” Mr. Burton wrote in an e-mail. “It seemed the perfect medium for the feature. There’s something tangible and so beautifully textured about stop-motion. I’ve always loved it.”And Mr. Burton helped inaugurate a generation of artists: Chris Butler worked on “Corpse Bride” (directed by Mr. Burton and Mike Johnson), a nominee in 2006, before going on to write and co-direct “ParaNorman,” another stop-motion nominee this year. Though the stop-motion films earned a fraction of the ticket sales of their fully digital compatriots, their triple recognition acknowledges “the craftsmanship and the art that goes into these things,” Mr. Butler said. “We always say it’s like making a live-action movie in miniature at a glacial pace.”In a joint phone interview on Tuesday, Sam Fell, the other director of “ParaNorman,” about a boy who can communicate with ghosts, added that “quite often it’s the stop-motion movies that are more out there,” adding, “They’re a little quirkier, they’re a little harder to pin down.”“Frankenweenie” is a horror-inspired take on a boy who reanimates his dead dog, with gleefully, ghoulishly Burtonian results. Mr. Burton said that film is “about how people question the value of science and art in this world, the creative mind in general, and accepting someone who thinks differently.”Another nominee, “The Pirates! Band of Misfits,” directed by Peter Lord, is a resplendently silly tale that joins Charles Darwin, Queen Victoria and a formally clad chimp on the high seas.With “ParaNorman,” “Frankenweenie” and “The Pirates! Band of Misfits” in production at roughly the same time, there was even a shortage of stop-motion experts. “We had to find a whole bunch of people, the next generation even, young people who just made a short film in their bedroom,” Mr. Fell said. “It really grew the community this year.” With the lengthy production process, “one movie in this medium is long enough for someone to really progress from being very inexperienced to having a real handle on the medium,” he said.Since the animated feature category was introduced at the Oscars for 2001 productions, the Academy’s short film and feature animation branch, which includes career cartoonists as well as designers and filmmakers, has regularly included stop-motion and hand-drawn fare — the work on which many in the field cut their teeth. The nominees are chosen by a volunteer group of 100 to 125 Academy members, half from the animation branch and half not, who must watch at least three-fourths of the eligible films, all on the big screen, said Jon Bloom, a governor and the chairman of the branch. This has led to some grumbling that the committee is a self-selected group, perhaps retirees, whose tastes might skew to the pre-computer graphics era.“The category is likened to foreign film and best picture, meaning that what we’re instructed to vote on is the entire achievement,” Mr. Bloom said. “We’re not voting on the best animation but the best animated film in its totality, and that means story and performance and animation and everything.”The feature winners are chosen by the Academy over all. The animation industry’s version of the Oscars, the Annies, will be handed out on Saturday; all five Oscar nominees are contenders there too, with other studio films like DreamWorks’ “Rise of the Guardians” and Sony Pictures’ “Hotel Transylvania.” “Brave” won the Golden Globe for animation but awards watchers are split on whether it, “Frankenweenie,” “ParaNorman” or “Wreck-It Ralph” lead the field at the Oscars. Clark Spencer, the producer of “Wreck-It Ralph,” whose art direction spans the evolution of video games, from the earliest eight-bit to the complex digital multiplayers today, said that as audiences have been primed by all different styles of animation, they are eager for more, whether that is a retro stop-motion look or a cutting-edge 3-D scene. “You tell a great story, but people always want to know what’s going to be unique about it visually,” he said.And the Academy, Mr. Bloom said, is acutely aware of the role that blockbuster animated films play in the telecast. That’s why the award is usually presented early during the ceremony. “The Academy is hoping to get interest in the Oscars from young viewers who may be going to bed soon afterward,” he said, “trying to indoctrinate a new generation.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/fashion/no-substitute-for-ryan-seacrest-noted-red-carpet.html,"IT’S EASY TO MAKE FUN of Ryan Seacrest — for his ubiquity on the show business landscape, for his overweening ambition, for his role in unleashing the Kardashian clan on America and for his relentless pursuit of celebrities as they head into award shows (captured most memorably a few years ago when he was shown on camera practically chasing Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie down the red carpet as they seemed determined to avoid him and his E! camera crew).But at the Screen Actors Guild awards on Sunday night, when the network turned to its B-team, Giuliana Rancic and Ross Matthews, to ask the all-important question — “Who are you wearing?” — of celebrities, many viewers of the network’s red carpet coverage might have been hit by a an unexpected sensation: a longing for the return of Mr. Seacrest.Whether it was forcing Hugh Jackman into a duet, talking baby weight with Claire Danes or telling Ben Affleck yet again about her obsessive crush on George Clooney (a cringe-worthy confession that seemed to embarrass even Mr. Affleck, no stranger to the inane celebrity interview during his “Bennifer” days), Ms. Rancic became increasingly difficult to watch as the night wore on.And when a giggling Ross Matthews asked Nicole Kidman if she hadn’t become a successful actress, would she ever have considered auditioning for “American Idol” (her husband, Keith Urban, is now a judge on the show), the look on the Oscar-winner’s face was one of “Who is this person and why am I talking to him?”In between commenting on the gowns displayed on the red carpet (thumbs up for Jennifer Lawrence and Anne Hathaway; mixed reactions to Julie Bowen and Julianne Moore), many members of the Twittersphere seemed taken aback by what they were watching.“This E! coverage is horrifying. Horrifying!” the fashion bloggers Tom & Lorenzo wrote. The comedian Ali Waller tweeted, “Which is most miserable: watching an interview with Giuliana Rancic, being interviewed by Giuliana Rancic, or being Giuliana Rancic?” The television blogger Daniel Fienberg wrote, “One of these red carpets, E! will replace Ross Matthews with an animated talking chipmunk and nobody will notice.”Come back Ryan. All is forgiven. "
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/fashion/front-row-ralph-lauren-gets-a-jump-on-fashion-week.html,"A few designers are getting a jump on the Fashion Week festivities by showing their fall collections now, either in small showroom presentations, or very big ones, as did Ralph Lauren with his men’s wear on Tuesday.Stepping onto the ninth floor of a glass office building on Madison Avenue was like stepping onto a movie set, or a very fancy department store with extremely good-looking customers. Mr. Lauren and his visual team do not skimp on a presentation.More than 30 models were spread throughout a showroom almost the size of a football field. Some posed in vitrines of tailored suits, with a notable emphasis on double-breasted looks, thick wools and the snug fit of recent James Bond wear.Farther on, the floor was decorated to look like the inside of a sporting club, with models in Polo chinos, tailored jackets and Fair Isle sweaters, mixed in with RLX puffer vests and eagle-motif knits. Some were hard to make out amid the array of taxidermy, vintage fishing gear, leather club chairs, fur pillows, hiking poles, a Prairie four wheeler and two kayaks hanging from the ceiling. A set like this really draws you in.A colleague plucked what he thought was a new Ralph Lauren accessory from one outfit. It was a duck call.A Juicy ControversyOffering fashion models a discount at a company whose products include a popular line of juice cleanses, in the name of good health, certainly sends a mixed message.Last week, the Council of Fashion Designers of America found itself at the center of an unexpected dust-up when it announced a 50 percent Fashion Week discount for models at Organic Avenue, a juice and health-food retailer with at least eight stores in the New York area. The discount is but one aspect of the council’s six-year-old health initiative for models and was intended to help them access “food that is both nutritious and convenient,” according to a release.But eating disorder specialists and model advocates did not see it that way. Several of them raised concerns that Organic Avenue is also known for its substantial business in juice cleanses. In one example of the outraged reaction, the model Whitney Thompson, an ambassador for the National Eating Disorders Association, told ABC News that “sending a model to a juice cleanse place is like sending an alcoholic to a bar.”What were they thinking?In an unusually pointed response from the council, which is normally as docile as Switzerland, Steven Kolb, its chief executive, was outraged by the outrage.“The controversy had more to do with the way it was reported, rather than us doing something inappropriate or wrong,” Mr. Kolb said. “Every season, someone throws a rock at us, and we are trying to do something good.”Mr. Kolb blamed the media for being sensationalistic and critics for distorting the efforts of the council, which he argued were well intended. Models who have participated in the health initiative have repeatedly complained about the absence of healthy food options at Fashion Week, and many of them are fans of Organic Avenue’s juices and raw food offerings.Executives at Organic Avenue, which promotes itself as a healthy lifestyle company, said they were disappointed that the partnership was portrayed as pushing models toward juice cleanses to lose weight.“That is entirely and completely inaccurate,” said Jessie Gould, the company’s senior vice president for retail. “Not only is that not what the partnership is, it was never even contemplated.”The problem for the fashion council is that this was not the message received, not amid larger concerns about the benefits of juice cleanses, which are popular among models.Sara Ziff, the founder of the Model Alliance, a labor group for models, noted a study last year on its Web site that showed that 64 percent of models who responded had been asked by their agents to lose weight and nearly half of the respondents had done cleanses. She said that 31 percent said they had suffered from an eating disorder.“Although I’m pleased to see the C.F.D.A. acknowledging that there is a health problem in the modeling industry, it’s worrying that their choice of partner happens to be one that profits from precisely the sort of restricted diets, including juice cleanses, that are part of the problem,” Ms. Ziff said.Mr. Kolb argued that the partnership was being misrepresented, noting that both the council and Organic Avenue would offer assistance to any model who asked. Making an issue out of it, he said, “often muddles our effort.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/business/during-trial-new-details-emerge-on-dupuy-hip.html,"When Johnson & Johnson announced the appointment in 2011 of an executive to head the troubled orthopedics division whose badly flawed artificial hip had been recalled, the company billed the move as a fresh start.But that same executive, it turns out, had supervised the implant’s introduction in the United States and had been told by a top company consultant three years before the device was recalled that it was faulty.In addition, the executive also held a senior marketing position at a time when Johnson & Johnson decided not to tell officials outside the United States that American regulators had refused to allow sale of a version of the artificial hip in this country.The details about the involvement of the executive, Andrew Ekdahl, with the all-metal hip implant emerged Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court during the trial of a patient lawsuit against the DePuy Orthopaedics division of Johnson & Johnson. More than 10,000 lawsuits have been filed against DePuy in connection with the device — the Articular Surface Replacement, or A.S.R. — and the Los Angeles case is the first to go to trial.The information about the depth of Mr. Ekdahl’s involvement with the implant may raise questions about DePuy’s ability to put the A.S.R. episode behind it.Asked in an e-mail why the company had promoted Mr. Ekdahl, a DePuy spokeswoman, Lorie Gawreluk, said the company “seeks the most accomplished and competent people for the job.”On Wednesday, portions of Mr. Ekdahl’s videotaped testimony were shown to jurors in the Los Angeles case. Other top DePuy marketing executives who played roles in the A.S.R. development are expected to testify in coming days. Mr. Ekdahl, when pressed in the taped questioning on whether DePuy had recalled the A.S.R. because it was unsafe, repeatedly responded that the company had recalled it “because it did not meet the clinical standards we wanted in the marketplace.”Before the device’s recall in mid-2010, Mr. Ekdahl and those executives all publicly asserted that the device was performing extremely well. But internal documents that have become public as a result of litigation conflict with such statements.In late 2008, for example, a surgeon who served as one of DePuy’s top consultants told Mr. Ekdahl and two other DePuy marketing officials that he was concerned about the cup component of the A.S.R. and believed it should be “redesigned.” At the time, DePuy was aggressively promoting the device in the United States as a breakthrough and it was being implanted into thousands of patients.“My thoughts would be that DePuy should at least de-emphasize the A.S.R. cup while the clinical results are studied,” that consultant, Dr. William Griffin, wrote.A spokesman for Dr. Griffin said he was not available for comment.The A.S.R., whose cup and ball components were both made of metal, was first sold by DePuy in 2003 outside the United States for use in an alternative hip replacement procedure called resurfacing. Two years later, DePuy started selling another version of the A.S.R. for use here in standard hip replacement that used the same cup component as the resurfacing device. Only the standard A.S.R. was sold in the United States; both versions were sold outside the country.Before the device recall in mid-2010, about 93,000 patients worldwide received an A.S.R., about a third of them in this country. Internal DePuy projections estimate that it will fail in 40 percent of those patients within five years; a rate eight times higher than for many other hip devices.Mr. Ekdahl testified via tape Wednesday that he had been placed in charge of the 2005 introduction of the standard version of the A.S.R. in this country. Within three years, he and other DePuy executives were receiving reports that the device was failing prematurely at higher than expected rates, apparently because of problems related to the cup’s design, documents disclosed during the trial indicate.Along with other DePuy executives, he also participated in a meeting that resulted in a proposal to redesign the A.S.R. cup. But that plan was dropped, apparently because sales of the implant had not justified the expense, DePuy documents indicate.In the face of growing complaints from surgeons about the A.S.R., DePuy officials maintained that the problems were related to how surgeons were implanting the cup, not from any design flaw. But in early 2009, a DePuy executive wrote to Mr. Ekdahl and other marketing officials that the early failures of the A.S.R. resurfacing device and the A.S.R. traditional implant, known as the XL, were most likely design-related.“The issue seen with A.S.R. and XL today, over five years post-launch, are most likely linked to the inherent design of the product and that is something we should recognize,” that executive, Raphael Pascaud wrote in March 2009.Last year, The New York Times reported that DePuy executives decided in 2009 to phase out the A.S.R. and sell existing inventories weeks after the Food and Drug Administration asked the company for more safety data about the implant.The F.D.A. also told the company at that time that it was rejecting its efforts to sell the resurfacing version of the device in the United States because of concerns about “high concentration of metal ions” in the blood of patients who received it.DePuy never disclosed the F.D.A. ruling to regulators in other countries where it was still marketing the resurfacing version of the implant.During a part of that period, Mr. Ekdahl was overseeing sales in Europe and other regions for DePuy. When The Times article appeared last year, he issued a statement, saying that any implication that the F.D.A. had determined there were safety issues with the A.S.R. was “simply untrue.” “This was purely a business decision,” Mr. Ekdahl stated at that time."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/sports/basketball/heat-show-the-nets-how-far-they-still-have-to-go.html,"For the better part of five weeks, the Nets evolved. They focused a bit harder, reached a bit higher, listened more intently and became a better version of themselves. But evolution is a squiggly path, not a straight line, and that path was obliterated Wednesday by a team that needs no growth or introspection.The Miami Heat dealt the Nets a blow so forceful, so profoundly humiliating, it might have knocked them right back into the doldrums of December. The final score was 105-85, but the gap seemed twice as wide, and the psychic damage perhaps even deeper.Most of the Nets’ players left the locker room before reporters arrived. Those that remained wore dull expressions, except for Gerald Wallace, who was simply seething.“Typical Nets basketball,” Wallace said. “We don’t play together. Careless turnovers. We don’t execute offensively. And defensively, we don’t do anything. We don’t defend. We don’t guard the ball. We don’t help each other out. It’s the same story as it’s been all season.”It hadn’t looked that way for most of January, with the Nets winning 11 of 14 games before this one, steadily climbing the Eastern Conference standings. Wallace said it was an illusion, a product of a soft schedule, and he may be right. The Nets have lost three of four games, all by double digits.“I honestly don’t know what’s going on,” Wallace fumed.LeBron James and Dwyane Wade, two fully evolved N.B.A. superstars, led the charge for Miami, putting together a highlight reel of flying dunks, all before a national television audience and with the Nets’ owner, Mikhail Prokhorov, watching from a luxury suite.James put up 24 points, 9 rebounds and 7 assists. Wade added 21 points. And the Heat hardly broke a sweat after putting the game away with a 36-14 third quarter.“When the bubble burst, it burst completely,” said P. J. Carlesimo, the Nets’ coach.Miami (29-13) swept the three-game season series, ended the Nets’ home winning streak at eight games and served up a timely reminder that the Nets (27-19) still have a lot of growing to do — competitively and otherwise.James got added motivation earlier in the day when Reggie Evans, the Nets’ brash forward, suggested that the Heat’s championship lacked legitimacy because it was won in a lockout-shortened season.“Yeah, he did,” James said of Evans motivating him. “Because no one knows what it takes unless you’ve done it. He hasn’t done it. I’m not going to sit here and give Reggie Evans a lot of press. I let my game do the talking. You just can’t come out and say something like that. He had no offensive rebounds. We did a number on him.”Brook Lopez, who was named to the All-Star team earlier in the day, led the Nets with 21 points and 7 rebounds. Everyone else struggled, with Joe Johnson and Deron Williams combining to go 8 for 24 from the field.Williams skipped practice Tuesday because of flu symptoms and was still dragging Wednesday. He scored 9 points in 34 minutes and never looked like himself, committing 6 turnovers. Carlesimo said he might have played him too long.The Nets wiped out a 12-point deficit in the first half and took a 49-49 tie into halftime. But Miami blitzed the Nets in the third quarter with a series of flashy dunks, fast-break baskets, timely 3-pointers and a 15-0 run over four minutes.The Nets stopped trying. At one point, Miami’s Mario Chalmers rebounded his own miss while literally sitting in the lane. The ball landed in his lap, while Lopez, Williams and Andray Blatche stood by. Chalmers calmly bounced a pass to Wade for a layup and a 75-60 lead.The Heat have beaten the Nets by an average of 21 points over three games, but Wallace and Johnson both insisted they were not that far behind Miami, or at least shouldn’t be.“It has nothing to do with the talent,” Wallace said, adding, “It just has to do with teamwork.”The tension started hours before tip-off, with Evans’ deriding the Heat’s championship in an interview with The Daily News, and James accusing the Nets of quitting on Coach Avery Johnson, who was fired in December.“They are playing with more passion, more together — they are playing like they want to play for their coach,” James told reporters after the Heat’s shootaround.By that time, Evans had already slighted the Heat, saying their title “doesn’t prove nothing.” He added, “That was a lockout season.”Taunting the N.B.A.’s best team is always inadvisable. The Nets should be clear on that much now.REBOUNDSNeither fans nor coaches viewed Brook Lopez as an All-Star this season, but he finally got his recognition from a higher source: Commissioner David Stern. With Boston’s Rajon Rondo out because of a knee injury, Stern selected Lopez as the replacement on the Eastern Conference roster. “I don’t think Brook gets selected if we’re not having the kind of year we’re having,” P. J. Carlesimo said. “So the team feels good about it, too.” In a statement, Lopez called the selection “a huge honor” and thanked his teammates, naming Deron Williams, Joe Johnson and Gerald Wallace. “They gift-wrap me buckets and take a lot of attention away from me on the court,” he said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/31/arts/music/patty-andrews-singer-with-the-andrews-sisters-dies-at-94.html,"Patty Andrews, the last of the Andrews Sisters, the jaunty vocal trio whose immensely popular music became part of the patriotic fabric of World War II America, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 94.Lynda Wells, a niece, confirmed the death.With their jazzy renditions of songs like “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy (of Company B),” “Rum and Coca-Cola” and “Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree (With Anyone Else but Me),” Patty, Maxene and LaVerne Andrews sold war bonds, boosted morale on the home front, performed withBing Crosby and with theGlenn Miller Orchestra, made movies and entertained thousands of American troops overseas, for whom the women represented the loves and the land the troops had left behind.Patty, the youngest, was a soprano and sang lead; Maxene handled the high harmony; and LaVerne, the oldest, took the low notes. They began singing together as children; by the time they were teenagers they made up an accomplished vocal group. Modeling their act on the commercially successful Boswell Sisters, they joined a traveling revue and sang at county fairs and in vaudeville shows. Their big break came in 1937 when they were signed by Decca Records, but their first recording went nowhere.Their second effort featured the popular standard “Nice Work If You Can Get It,” but it was the flip side that turned out to be pure gold. The song was a Yiddish show tune, “Bei Mir Bist Du Schön (Means That You’re Grand),” with new English lyrics bySammy Cahn, and the Andrews Sisters’ version, recorded in 1937, became the top-selling record in the country.Other hits followed, and in 1940 they were signed by Universal Pictures. They appeared in more than a dozen films during the next seven years — sometimes just singing, sometimes also acting. They made their film debut in “Argentine Nights,” a 1940 comedy that starred the Ritz Brothers, and the next year appeared in three films with Bud Abbott and Lou Costello:“Buck Privates,” “In the Navy”and “Hold That Ghost.” Their film credits also include “Swingtime Johnny” (1943), “Hollywood Canteen” (1944) and the Bob Hope-Bing Crosby comedy “Road to Rio” (1947).After selling more than 75 million records, the Andrews Sisters broke up in 1953 when Patty decided to go solo. By 1956 they were together again, but musical tastes were changing and they found it hard to adapt. When LaVerne Andrews died of cancer in 1967, no suitable replacement could be found, and Patty and Maxene soon went their separate ways. Patty continued to perform solo, and Maxene joined the staff of a private college in South Lake Tahoe, Calif.Patricia Marie Andrews was born on Feb. 16, 1918, in Minneapolis. Her father, Peter, was a Greek immigrant who changed his name from Andreos to Andrews when he came to America. Her mother, Olga, was Norwegian.Like her older sisters, Patty learned to love music as a child (she also became a good tap dancer), and she did not have to be persuaded when Maxene suggested that the sisters form a trio in 1932. She was 14 when they began to perform in public.As their fame and fortune grew, the sisters came to realize that the public saw them as an entity, not as individuals. In a 1974 interview with The New York Times, Patty explained what that was like: “When our fans used to see one of us, they’d always ask, ‘Where are your sisters?’ Every time we got an award, it was just one award for the three of us.” This could be irritating, she said with a touch of exasperation: “We’re not glued together.”The Andrews Sisters re-entered the limelight in the early 1970s when Bette Midler released her own recording of “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,” modeled closely on theirs. It reached the Top 10, and its success led to several new compilations of the Andrews Sisters’ own hits.The previous year, Patty Andrews had appeared in a West Coast musical called “Victory Canteen,” set during World War II. When the show was rewritten for Broadway and renamed “Over Here!,” the producers decided that the Andrews Sisters were the only logical choice for the leads. They hired Patty and lured Maxene back into show business as well. The show opened in March 1974 and was the sisters’ belated Broadway debut. It was also the last time they sang together.The sisters got into a bitter money dispute with the producers and with each other, leading to the show’s closing in January 1975 and the cancellation of plans for a national tour. After that, the sisters pursued solo careers into the 1990s. They never reconciled and were still estranged when Maxene Andrews died in 1995.Patty Andrews’s first marriage, to the movie producer Marty Melcher, lasted two years and ended in divorce in 1949. (Mr. Melcher later married Doris Day.) In 1951 she married Wally Weschler, who had been the sisters’ pianist and conductor and who later became her manager. They had no children. Mr. Weschler died in 2010. Ms. Andrews is survived by her foster daughter, Pam DuBois.A final salute to the Andrews Sisters came in 1991 in the form of “Company B,” a ballet by the choreographer Paul Taylor subtitled “Songs Sung by the Andrews Sisters.” The work, which featured nine of the trio’s most popular songs, including “Rum and Coca-Cola” and, of course, “Boogie Woogie Bugle Boy,” underscored the enduring appeal of the three sisters from Minneapolis."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/arts/music/west-eastern-divan-orchestra-at-carnegie-hall.html,"When musicians play together, whether in a violin duo or a 100-piece orchestra, they must of necessity listen to one another. That simple fact was central to the vision of the conductor and pianist Daniel Barenboim and his good friend Edward W. Said, the Palestinian American literary scholar, when they founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in 1999.The ensemble brings young Israeli, Palestinian and other Arab musicians together for an extensive summer training institute and international concert tours. On Wednesday night at Carnegie Hall Mr. Barenboim led the orchestra in the first of four programs devoted to the nine Beethoven symphonies, before a packed and enthusiastic house. The concert offered the First, Eighth and Fifth Symphonies in performances that, despite shaky spots, were lithe, textured and natural.The naturalness was a given, since in all his work Mr. Barenboim combines intellectual understanding of music with a spontaneity that can sometimes seem impetuous. But in a way his approach reinforces a founding goal of the orchestra: When playing for Mr. Barenboim, these young musicians must draw in the moment upon their listening skills.The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra takes its name from a book of poetry by Goethe exploring the concept of world culture. In 2002 the orchestra, adopted by the Andalusian government in Spain and a private foundation, set up its summer headquarters in Seville. Since then a number of European players, especially from Spain, have taken part.From the project’s start, Said, who died in 2003, and Mr. Barenboim made no great claims for the transformative potential of the orchestra. But dialogue is a precondition to understanding. And dialogue is unavoidable when young musicians play music and live together.This series is part of the Beethoven for All project. In 2011 Mr. Barenboim and the West-Eastern Divan players recorded the complete Beethoven symphonies for Decca, available as a five-CD set and for downloading.At 70, Mr. Barenboim remains a tireless figure in the music world. But a few days ago he slipped while in Berlin and hurt his leg. A couple of times on Wednesday he needed the supporting arm of a violinist to step down from the podium. Mr. Barenboim is a conductor who does not like to hover over players and fuss with every cue. On this occasion, though, there were whole stretches of music in which he rested a hand on the back rail of the podium and let the musicians play while he kept an eye on things. Of course the players know these scores, and Mr. Barenboim, intimately.Mr. Barenboim turned the playful, slow introduction of the first movement of the First Symphony into a charming tease. Once the main Allegro section took off, the playing was impish and jaunty. The orchestra sound was warm and glowing in the genial second movement. Though the finale had some careless playing, the performance conveyed the music’s breathless vitality and Promethean humor.Mr. Barenboim and the orchestra tore into the exuberant opening of the Eighth Symphony, with full-bodied sound and a touch of wildness. The entire performance had an on-the-edge quality that was worth the trade-off of occasional slips and unfocused playing.The concert concluded with a weighty and majestic account of the Fifth Symphony. The slow movement was especially striking. Taken at a restrained tempo, it seemed not a respite from the battling energy of the first movement but the core of the whole work. Mr. Barenboim boldly emphasized the dynamic contrasts between the introverted and extroverted passages.When the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra made its Carnegie Hall debut in 2006, audience members had to pass through metal detectors in the lobby amid security threats. On Wednesday, happily, the atmosphere was relaxed, with people mingling in the lobby after the concert, stopping by a table to purchase the orchestra’s boxed-set recording of the Beethoven symphonies."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/nyregion/box-office-duds-have-a-following-too.html,"ON a cold night in early December a young crowd packed into the cozy 72-seat screening room at the 92Y TriBeCa. The film that was about to be shown would be accompanied by live commentary from the hosts of “The Flop House,” a podcast dedicated to bad movies. Those hosts were two moonlighting writers from “The Daily Show,” Dan McCoy and Elliott Kalan, and their laconic friend Stuart Wellington. After a short introduction, the three sat in the front row as the lights went down.The movie started, and Mr. McCoy’s voice came over the sound system. “Oh, ‘Argo.’ I’d wanted to see this.”This set up a big laugh for when the film’s actual title card appeared. It read “Bratz: The Movie,” in a garish font. The camera panned to a sunny cul-de-sac, then cut to a girl’s bedroom, where an ornate pink alarm clock started ringing.“Wow, even their clocks have bratitude,” Mr. Kalan said, a deadpan reference to the shopworn portmanteau of the toy line Bratz.The movie unspooled from there, a mix of consumerist fantasy (there are multiple sequences of girls trying on clothes), banal girl-power rhetoric and frequent moments of confounding badness. Twenty minutes in, text appeared on the screen to say that the action was about to cut two years into the future for no discernible reason. The crowd was apoplectic. The commentators gave out halfhearted cries. Mr. Kalan speculated that the movie was about to enter a post-apocalyptic future, but of course it immediately returned to a suburban high school. “Bratz” is packed with weird moments like this, and they seemed to get more outlandish as the audience got more beery.Funny, raucous bad-movie nights have become an important part of the 92Y TriBeCa’s programming. The film programmer there, Cristina Cacioppo, estimated that one-fourth to half the slate of movies is made up of camp, though she said that’s often not deliberate. “I programmed a singalong night for ‘Grease 2’ at one point,” Ms. Cacioppo said. “But that’s because I sincerely liked that movie.” Most of the films don’t have an overlay of commentary, but there’s an unspoken pact that audience members can, within reason, add their own gibes to the soundtrack.Ms. Cacioppo began programming these movies because she saw a dearth of formalized events in New York for fans of trash cinema when the 92Y opened in 2008. Since then they have become more common. The Landmark Sunshine Cinema on the Lower East Side hosts a screening of the cult hit “The Room” on the first Saturday of every month (that means this weekend), while the IFC Center in Greenwich Village will occasionally smuggle a turkey like “Red Dawn” (the Patrick Swayze version) into its otherwise impeccable Waverley Midnights schedule. The Nitehawk Cinema in Brooklyn is also screening some duds this month, like the Indonesian action knockoff “Lady Terminator.” Both the Nitehawk and the 92Y have the added benefit of being licensed to serve alcohol.Ms. Cacioppo said that her bad-movie nights quickly caught on with New Yorkers in their 20s and 30s, the type of cinephiles who grew up renting lousy VHS tapes and watching the cult cable show “Mystery Science Theater 3000.” At first Ms. Cacioppo would show bad movies on weeknights when the screening room had not been reserved. But since then events like her Swayze Days of Summer series (featuring the most dubious hits from the 1980s star) have tended to get a stronger turnout at the 92Y than more serious-minded fare, like foreign-language films or small indie dramas. Among the most anticipated events on the calendar are the periodic live riffing nights performed by the “Flop House” hosts. (The podcast itself is usually recorded, without an audience, in Mr. McCoy’s Brooklyn apartment.)Ms. Cacioppo said their “Bratz” event sold out faster than an appearance by Peter Bogdanovich in the same space earlier last year. Their next show is Friday, when they will comment on the misguided Steve-Guttenberg-in-a-mullet romantic comedy “Don’t Tell Her It’s Me.”“Dan used to actually organize screenings of good movies,” Mr. Kalan said of his “Flop House” colleague. “But I think he realized it was harder to get people to come out for those. With a bad movie it’s a social event.”The podcast is silly and fun, even if the movies it examines are not. “The Flop House” looks exclusively at contemporary bad movies made with large, corporate budgets. According to Mr. Kalan that means most of the movies they watch are merely insipid, the kind of boring copycat film that can make up a good chunk of Hollywood’s output. Regardless, the podcast is still a great listen for movie fans with a very particular sensibility. Mr. Kalan has an encyclopedic film knowledge, and all three hosts offer deep genre-movie context. They’re also adept improvisers, able to extrapolate riffs out of a movie’s most banal plot turns.Bad-movie appreciation has a long history, some of which can be credited to “Mystery Science Theater 3000” (or in fan shorthand, “MST3K”), which ran from 1988 to 1999. The show’s conceit revolved around an isolated spaceman and his robot companions, who by some sad twist of fate are forced to watch the worst movies ever made, everything from low-rent creature features to overheated martial-arts movies. To stay sane the spaceman and his robots would riff their own comments over the movie, peppering their dialogue with pop culture in-jokes. The comedian Patton Oswalt cited the show for helping him understand his own aesthetic.“It reminded me a lot, before I could articulate it, of the kind of things being done by comedians I was hanging out with at the time,” Mr. Oswalt said. “We were dealing with awful club owners, and we had to make it fun for ourselves somehow. That’s how we would talk to each other.”Many of the writers involved in that show are still working in the bad-movie world. RiffTrax, a company made up of “MST3K” alumni, has developed a successful business by selling these writers’ commentaries as MP3s. They occasionally have shows beamed into movie theaters nationwide by Fathom Events, the same company that coordinates simulcasts of the Metropolitan Opera. Joel Hodgson, the original host of “Mystery Science Theater,” tours the country with his own group, Cinematic Titanic, and even teaches a course on movie riffing.The “MST3K” gang has inspired a large cohort of imitators. “I do feel like bad-movie culture is more prominent now than it was in the 1990s,” said Nathan Rabin, the head writer for the Onion A.V. Club, who chronicles the pleasures of bad movies in his weekly column, My World of Flops. Mr. Rabin cites the Internet for providing access to a deep historical reserve of bad movies, creating a more literate class of new fans who are eager to build community.Today cities like Los Angeles, Austin, San Francisco and Portland, Ore., have regular performances by troupes of riffers. The Web site Red Letter Media has gained attention for its bleak, film-length takedown “reviews” of the Star Wars prequels. Particularly notorious bad movies, like “The Room” and “Birdemic: Shock and Terror,” have been filling theaters across the country for the past few years.Bad-movie podcasts have also grown in number, if not necessarily quality. Perhaps the most popular is “How Did This Get Made?,” a gabfest hosted by a trio of comic actors from Los Angeles. The hosts have brought in famous names like Michael Ian Black, Kevin Smith and Vanilla Ice to share in their bafflement, and the show was recently named “one of the most reliable pleasures of the Internet” by no less a cultural authority than The New Yorker. They occasionally do the podcast before an audience, and sold out two shows at the Bell House in Gowanus, Brooklyn, in December.Mr. Oswalt cited that podcast as a favorite, in part because he said the hosts aren’t cynical but have an uncurdled enthusiasm for the most outlandish moments in films, the ones untethered from narrative logic or sanity, the kind of scenes that make certain movies, as Mr. Oswalt called them, “fun bad.”“You can’t do it as a scold, or just for the sake of hating something,” he said “You actually have to revel in how godawful this is.”This need to revel is why seeing bad movies in a theater or at a party, away from the isolation of your laptop, is so important. While Web sites, podcasts and Amazon Instant provide many opportunities for bad-movie aficionados to get a fix, the best part of the subculture is the live event, when inexplicable plot turns and visual details are amplified by a laughing crowd. These films work best as a social emulsifiers, common causes that unite people around questions, like “Why does John Travolta have dreadlocks in this?” or “Did Nicolas Cage actually read the script, or is he improvising his dialogue?” or “Seriously, how did this get made?”“Nobody ever sets out to make a bad movie,” Mr. Oswalt said, “so when you laugh at a bad movie, you’re kind of whistling by the graveyard. You are confronting the movie and forcing enjoyment out of something bad. There’s something kind of beautiful about that.”The fare:DON’T TELL HER IT’S ME Friday, 8 p.m.,, 92Y TriBeCa, 200 Hudson Street, between Vestry and Canal Streets, TriBeCa; (212) 601-1000, 92y.org/Tribeca.THE ROOM First Saturday of every month, midnight, Landmark Sunshine Cinema, 143 East Houston Street, between Forsyth and Eldridge Streets, Lower East Side; (888) 724-6362, landmarktheatres.com/market/newyork/sunshinecinema.htm.THE TRIP Feb. 16, 7 p.m., 92Y Tribeca (information above).LADY TERMINATOR Feb. 23 and 24, 12:10 a.m., Nitehawk Cinema, 136 Metropolitan Avenue, between Wythe Avenue and Berry Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 384-3980, nitehawkcinema.com.Other sites that include screenings of bad movies:CHELSEA CLEARVIEW CINEMAS 260 West 23rd Street, Manhattan; (212) 777-3456, clearviewcinemas.com.IFC CENTER 323 Sixth Avenue, at Third Street, East Village; (212) 924-7771, ifccenter.com.VIDEOLOGY 308 Bedford Avenue, at South First Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn; (718) 782-3468, videology.info.Online:THE FLOP HOUSE flophousepodcast.com.HOW DID THIS GET MADE? earwolf.com/show/how-did-this-get-made.I LOVE BAD MOVIES Ilovebadmovies.comMY WORLD OF FLOPS avclub.com/features/my-world-of-flops.RED LETTER MEDIA redlettermedia.com.RIFFTRAX rifftrax.com."

The cast is rounded out by Emma Thompson as the prime minister’s sister, a middle-aged housewife whose husband (Alan Rickman) is besotted with his secretary (Heike Makatsch); Liam Neeson as a widower and single stepfather wallowing in grief; Colin Firth as a writer cuckolded by his own brother; and Martin Freeman and Joanna Page as actors who fall in love while working as body doubles in a sex scene on a movie set, only to end their first date with a chaste kiss on the cheek. A. O. Scott, writing in The Times, said that a “genuine comic spark comes from Bill Nighy, playing a washed-up, dissolute rock star named Billy Mack, who is trying for a comeback with a treacly Christmas record.”8 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/arts/music/carnegie-hall-announces-its-2013-14-season.html,"The Vienna Philharmonic will give seven concerts at Carnegie Hall next season, including unstaged performances of Berg’s “Wozzeck” and Richard Strauss’s “Salome” in the guise of the orchestra of the Vienna State Opera, Carnegie officials said on Thursday.The orchestra will serve as the centerpiece of Carnegie’s latest festival, Vienna: City of Dreams, which will join past themes — among them Berlin, China, Japan, Leonard Bernstein and African-American culture — as subjects of scrutiny on West 57th Street and around the city.Franz Welser-Möst, Daniele Gatti, Andris Nelsons and Zubin Mehta will conduct the Vienna Philharmonic. Viennese chamber music, songs and contemporary music will also be on the agenda of the festival, which will run from Feb. 21 to March 16, 2014.Carnegie disclosed the festival in announcing its programming for next season, which will include a focus on Benjamin Britten, whose 100th birthday is being celebrated in 2013; all of the Sibelius symphonies, played by the Minnesota Orchestra and its music director, Osmo Vanska; and three concerts by Valery Gergiev, leading his Mariinsky Orchestra in honor of his 60th birthday.Carnegie also said that David Lang would serve as its composer in residence.A celebration of music by composers including Schubert, Beethoven, Mahler and Strauss, with appearances by Carnegie regulars like the Vienna Philharmonic, may not seem like a surprising festival choice. But Clive Gillinson, Carnegie’s executive and artistic director, said in an interview that the offerings would be broad and include lesser-known contemporary music. He also said that having seven concerts by the Philharmonic at Carnegie was “unprecedented.”Mr. Gillinson said he was unconcerned about the effects of a labor dispute on the Minnesota Orchestra; that struggle has kept it silent so far this season.“I don’t think anybody’s going to let their playing go,” he said. “Osmo Vanska will be absolutely clear. This is a huge thing for them as well.”In other new-season announcements released in recent days:¶ The New Jersey Symphony will pay tribute to the 50th anniversary of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.’s “I Have a Dream” speech in its opening concert, featuring Duke Ellington’s “Three Black Kings” and “New World A-Comin’.” It will give the first performance of a work commissioned from Geri Allen, and it will offer Dvorak’s Symphony No. 9, “From the New World,” with spirituals performed between movements.It will also present a new clarinet concerto by Richard Danielpour; the first performance of a new work by Lowell Liebermann (a Weehawken, N.J., resident, the symphony pointed out); and a heavy dose of Richard Strauss, celebrating the 150th anniversary of his birth.¶ The Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, with Louis Langrée in his first year as music director, will peg his first performances to another speech anniversary: that of Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address, delivered in 1863, 150 years ago. The program centers on Aaron Copland’s “Lincoln Portrait,” with Maya Angelou narrating. Much of the text comes from the address. Mr. Langrée is familiar to New York audiences as the music director of the Mostly Mozart Festival Orchestra.¶ The American Symphony Orchestra, known for its tightly themed concerts, will have Carnegie Hall performances focused on the New York avant-garde; Elliott Carter; Jules Massenet’s opera “Ariane”; 20th-century British music; Max Bruch’s oratorio “Moses”; and patriotic and nationalist music.¶ The Seattle Opera plans a Wagner “Ring” cycle in the summer, followed by Donizetti’s “Fille du Régiment,” Verdi’s “Rigoletto,” Menotti’s “Consul” and Offenbach’s “Contes d’Hoffmann.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/business/hip-implants-risks-inadequately-assessed-depuy-report-found-in-2010.html,"A review conducted internally by Johnson & Johnson soon after it recalled a troubled hip implant found that the company had not adequately assessed the device’s potential risks before it was used in more than 90,000 patients, court testimony on Thursday showed.The engineering report, which was done in 2010, also found that Johnson & Johnson’s orthopedic unit had used inadequate or incorrect standards in trying to assess some of those risks before first selling the implant in 2003. The device at issue — the Articular Surface Replacement, or A.S.R. — proved to be among the most flawed orthopedic devices sold in recent decades.The report was introduced on Thursday in Los Angeles Superior Court, in the first A.S.R.-related lawsuit to go to trial against the DePuy Orthopaedics division of Johnson & Johnson. More than 10,000 similar lawsuits have been filed in the United States.In videotaped testimony shown in court, Jimmy Smith, a compliance manager at DePuy, was asked about the report, and he said it indicated that company officials had not used appropriate engineering controls to try to anticipate the device’s problems.“They did their job, but they could have done it better,” Mr. Smith said.Separately, a DePuy engineer, Graham Isaac, testified on Thursday that before selling the A.S.R., the company only tested its performance on laboratory equipment at one angle of implantation.Depending on the surgical technique and a patient’s build, orthopedic surgeons can implant the cup component of an artificial hip at a variety of angles. And because the A.S.R. had a design flaw, normal variance from the single angle at which DePuy had tested it made it more likely for the joint’s cup and ball components to strike each other, releasing metallic debris inside a patient.DePuy conducted the post-mortem review of the A.S.R. in November 2010, just three months after it recalled the all-metal implant, but it never released the analysis. It also, apparently, did not conduct a similar review in response to the mounting number of complaints about the device that it received from doctors and others in 2008 and 2009.Lorie Gawreluk, a spokeswoman for DePuy, said that she could not comment on any details of the lawsuit, but that the company believed that the evidence would show it acted appropriately. The trial’s proceedings were monitored over the Courtroom View Network.The A.S.R. is projected to fail within five years in about 40 percent of patients who received the implant. That early failure rate, which is expected to grow over time, is many times higher than the failure rate for most hip replacements.In the post-recall review in 2010, DePuy engineers examined the criteria and “controls,” or standards, that were used nearly a decade earlier when company officials tried to anticipate how the A.S.R. might perform. Because the version of the device that was sold in the United States was never clinically tested in patients, officials used the controls to assess the implant.Among other things, DePuy officials failed to anticipate that the A.S.R. would have a high rate of wear as a patient moved, even though the control referenced in the device’s records demonstrated “that the product is more likely to experience contact between the head and rim” than competing implants.In previously recorded testimony presented in court on Wednesday, DePuy’s president, Andrew Ekdahl, was shown an e-mail in which he was warned about the A.S.R.’s problems nearly three years before it was recalled.Mr. Ekdahl and other DePuy executives have asserted that they acted properly and in a timely fashion to the device’s problems. The company spokeswoman, Ms. Gawreluk, said Mr. Ekdahl would not be made available for an interview."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/movies/movie-listings-for-feb-1-7.html,"Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.★ ‘Amour’ (PG-13, 2:07) A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between, the latest from the great director Michael Haneke (“The White Ribbon,” “Caché”) takes a long, hard, tender look at an elderly French couple, Georges and Anne — played by two titans of French cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva — in their final days. Bring hankies. (Manohla Dargis)★ ‘Anna Karenina’ (R, 2:10) Joe Wright’s version of the Tolstoy novel, with a script by Tom Stoppard, is wildly, sometimes dizzily theatrical, taking place mostly on a series of elaborate stage sets. The story of Anna (Keira Knightley), her humorless husband (Jude Law) and her lover, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) becomes a lush melodrama, counterpointed by the delicate romance of Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and Levin (Domhnall Gleeson). Not a faithful adaptation, by any means, but something better: a bold, lively and ardent reimagining of the book. (A. O. Scott)★ ‘Argo’ (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)★ ‘Barbara’ (PG-13; 1:45) Christian Petzold directs this tense, smart film about an East German doctor (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been banished to the boonies. There, in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police, she waits and she burns. (Dargis)‘Birth Story: Ina May Gaskin & the Farm Midwives’ (No rating, 1:35) Sara Lamm and Mary Wigmore’s beamingly one-sided ode to natural childbirth showcases Ms. Gaskin’s dislike of the “for-profit hospital system” with glowing images of ecstatically grunting women and zero statistical comparisons of less-than-optimal outcomes. (Jeannette Catsoulis)‘Broken City’ (R, 1:49) The director Allen Hughes’s latest tale about power and its abuse in the city revolves around the moral education of a cop (Mark Wahlberg) who shoots a man dead and is forced to turn in his badge. (Dargis)‘The Central Park Five’ (No rating, 1:59) Directed by Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns, this documentary revisits the 1989 rape and beating of the white woman known as the Central Park jogger and the five black and Latino teenagers accused of assaulting her. The five were imprisoned but later exonerated; the filmmakers look back at what happened and why. (Dargis)★ ‘Chasing Ice’ (PG-13, 1:16) The timing couldn’t be better for this documentary about the work of James Balog, who set out to provide visual evidence of the effects of global warming by taking time-lapse photographs of melting glaciers. The images are as beautiful as they are important. (Neil Genzlinger)★ ‘Django Unchained’ (R, 2:45) Blaxploitation and spaghetti western meet in the Old South in Quentin Tarantino’s latest provocation, with — literally! — explosive results. Jamie Foxx is Django, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), whose partner and protégé he becomes. After the two kill off a bunch of bad guys, they set off to free Django’s wife (Kerry Washington) from captivity at a nightmarish plantation called Candyland. Bloody, farcical and cartoonish, “Django Unchained” is at once a wildly entertaining, borderline-irresponsible fantasy and a bold and serious attempt to use the imaginative resources of popular culture to address an old and durable historical injustice. (Scott)★ ‘56 Up’ (No rating, 2:24) The latest installment in Michael Apted’s remarkable documentary project that has followed a group of Britons since 1964, starting when they were 7, checks in on them at 56. (Dargis)★ ‘Flight’  (R, 2:18) A titanic Denzel Washington plays a veteran commercial pilot whose greatest vocation should be his flying but has instead, for various reasons, become his drinking. Robert Zemeckis directs his finest movie since “Cast Away.” (Dargis)‘Gangster Squad’ (R, 1:53) This brainless, hopped-up, ultraviolent Los Angeles noir, directed by Ruben Fleischer, assembles an impressive cast (including Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone) and some spiffy period costumes. (Scott)★ ‘The Gatekeepers’ (PG-13, 1:37) Not recommended for anyone clinging to optimism about the Middle East, this documentary, consisting of interviews with six former heads of Shin Bet, the Israeli security agency, is a devastating and informative anatomy of politics, terrorism and the post-1967 collisions between Zionism and Palestinian nationalism. Recommended for anyone who can handle the truth. (Scott)‘Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters’ (R, 1:41) It’s nice to see something other than a vampire or a zombie on a movie screen, and the witches in this film, directed by Tommy Wirkola, are pretty terrifying. The script, though, could use a bit more wit, and the stars, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as the grown-up brother and sister from the fairy tale, could use a bit more chemistry. (Genzlinger)‘Happy People: A Year in the Taiga’ (No rating, 1:34, in English and Russian) In “Happy People: A Year in the Taiga,” Werner Herzog airdrops us into the vast Siberian taiga (a sprawling region of subarctic forest) for a seasonal portrait focusing on fur trappers. Rather than Mr. Herzog’s customary foray into the abyss, this film, culled from a Russian television documentary and given a philosophizing voiceover, is a quaint throwback to the illustrated chronicles of television nature documentaries. (Nicolas Rapold)‘A Haunted House’  (R, 1:37) The brand of horror film that features hand-held cameras and found footage probably didn’t need spoofing in the first place, but this clumsy movie tries anyway. It fails, because the writers (Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez) and the director (Mike Tiddes) are content with sophomoric humor and lazy story about a couple (Mr. Wayans and Essence Atkins) who decide to move in together. A demon moves in too. (Genzlinger)‘The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’ (PG-13, 2:50) Peter Jackson’s adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien novel — the first in a trilogy of films — is a slick, bloated, lumbering bore, a profit-minded exercise in theme-park-ride cinema that has neither the charm of the book nor the grandeur of Mr. Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” movies. (Scott)★ ‘Holy Motors’ (No rating, 1:55, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)‘The Impossible’ (PG-13; 1:47) A story of survival set against the Asian tsunami of 2004, about a British family (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are the parents) vacationing in Thailand when disaster strikes. The performances are excellent (Tom Holland, as the couple’s oldest son, is especially strong), and the director, Juan Antonio Bayona, deftly recreates the violence of the killer waves and the desolation they left in their wake. Still, something is troubling about the film’s almost complete neglect of the non-Western victims of the tsunami. This is the story of a very bad holiday rather than of a mass catastrophe. (Scott)‘Jack Reacher’ (PG-13; 2:10) Jack who? If you need to ask, you may be at the wrong movie, but just in case: He is the ex-military vigilante from Lee Child’s series of macho pulp novels, played by Tom Cruise and hunting down killers in the city of Pittsburgh. Much duller than it sounds, except when Werner Herzog or Robert Duvall is on screen. (Scott)‘The Last Stand’ (R, 1:47) Arnold Schwarzenegger returns to the top of the bill in this bloody thriller, playing a small-town sheriff about as unconvincingly as is humanly possible. An escaped drug lord is headed for his border town in a souped-up car, and he and some misfit deputies have to stop him. One amusing 60-second stretch of mayhem almost makes up for the formulaic remainder of the film. (Genzlinger)★ ‘A Late Quartet’ (R, 1:45) The upheavals that threaten the future of the fictional Fugue String Quartet in Yaron Zilberman’s magnificently acted film may be wildly exaggerated. But it would be shortsighted to dismiss this deeply felt, musically savvy film set in a refined cultural precinct of Manhattan as sudsy melodrama. (Stephen Holden)‘Life of Pi’ (PG, 2:06) In bringing Yann Martel’s beloved novel to the screen, Ang Lee has created a 3-D digital fable that is often stunning to behold. The middle section, in which the title character and a Bengal tiger share a lifeboat after a shipwreck, is touching and clever, but its delicacy is spoiled by a fuzzy, cloying spiritualism that hangs over everything like a humid cloud. (Scott)★ ‘Lincoln’ (PG-13, 2:29) Daniel Day-Lewis plays the Great Emancipator with playful wit as well as gravity. This film, directed by Steven Spielberg from a bristling, discursive script by Tony Kushner, focuses on Lincoln’s political skills and confines itself mainly to a single momentous month in his presidency. Anyone capable of being moved — or appalled — by the workings of democracy is likely to be enthralled by the intricate battle of wills surrounding the passage of the 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery in the United States. The superb supporting cast (including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens) helps turn the movie into a group portrait of leadership in crisis. It’s a democratic masterpiece, a history lesson full of historical detail and honest patriotic emotion. (Scott)‘Mama’ (PG-13, 1:49) This ghost story starring Jessica Chastain offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don’t often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don’t want anyone to take an ax to them. (Dargis)★ ‘The Master’ (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)‘Les Misérables’ (PG-13, 2:37) Tom Hooper (“The King’s Speech”) directs this overly busy screen version of the popular musical with Hugh Jackman as the reformed prisoner, Russell Crowe as his tormentor and Anne Hathaway as the prostitute turned martyr. By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat. (Dargis)‘Movie 43’ (R, 2:55) The kindest thing to be said about this star-saturated collection of crude one-joke vignettes made with big-time directors is that most of the participants seem to relish being naughty. (Holden)‘My Brooklyn’ (No rating, 1:16) As much personal essay as urban-policy survey, Kelly Anderson’s sensitive study of gentrification in her home borough traces a tale of aggressive rezoning, multimillion-dollar development deals and racial displacement. (Catsoulis)‘Parental Guidance’ (PG, 1:44) Billy Crystal stars as a baseball announcer who, when not being indulged by his wife (Bette Midler), schools his daughter (Marisa Tomei) and grandkids on the right way to do everything. Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse wrote the script, and Andy Fickman gives it some snap. (Dargis)‘Parker’ (R, 1:58) This blunt and bloody tale of underworld revenge — based on a pseudonymous novel by Donald E. Westlake — stars Jason Statham as the title character, a brilliant thief with a stony sense of honor. He travels to Palm Beach to collect payback from a gang that ripped him off, and the violence of that undertaking is leavened by the screwball almost-romance that unfolds between him and a local real estate agent played by Jennifer Lopez. Taylor Hackford (“An Officer and a Gentleman,” “Ray”) directed, with the unpretentious skill a movie like this requires. (Scott)‘Quartet’ (PG-13, 1:38) A chance to watch vintage British actors in mildly naughty, gently touching circumstances. Dustin Hoffman directed this tale of retired musicians — played by Billy Connolly, Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay, among others — settling old scores and singing old songs. (Scott)‘Race 2’ (No rating, 2:30, in Hindi) A Bollywood thriller set mostly in Turkey, “Race 2” spends a lot of time ogling wealthy lifestyles and two international men of mystery (Saif Ali Khan and John Abraham). There’s not much fizz in this movie, whose plot goes on and on. So it comes as no surprise when one character asks “What happens next in this race?” The answer is: “Same thing that happened before.” (Rachel Saltz)★ ‘Rust and Bone’ (R, 2:00, in French) Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet,” “The Beat That My Heart Skipped”) directs this tough and tender melodrama with a ferocious conviction that disguises some of its sentimental soft spots. The Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts plays Ali, a sometime prizefighter and unreliable father who befriends Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard), a trainer of killer whales trying to recover after a terrible accident. The romance that blossoms between them is sexy and volatile, as are the performances, which are absolutely convincing even when the story is not. (Scott)★ ‘Searching for Sugar Man’ (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul’s hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don’t wait for the DVD. (Dargis)★ ‘The Sessions’ (R, 1:35) The movie couple of the year, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt — re-enacting the true story of a disabled, virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate — infuse this film, directed and written by Ben Lewin, with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor. (Holden)★ ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ (R, 2:00) David O. Russell’s exuberant new comedy tracks the feverish, happy, sad, absurdly funny ups and downs of a head case (Bradley Cooper) just as he returns to his parents’ home after eight months in a mental institution. When he meets a heartbreak beauty (Jennifer Lawrence), he finds fresh purpose in a movie that honks for happiness. (Dargis)★ ‘Skyfall’ (PG-13, 2:23) Directed by a surprisingly suitable Sam Mendes, this latest Bond is a superior follow-up to “Casino Royale,” the 2006 reboot that introduced the excellent Daniel Craig as 007. Playful but never frivolous, it comes off as something of a franchise rethink, partly because it brings in new faces and implies that Bond, like Jason Bourne, needed to be reborn. (Dargis)‘Supporting Characters’ (No rating, 1:37) There are many rueful chuckles to be harvested from Daniel Schechter’s small, minutely observed portrait of fragile egos colliding inside the pressure cooker of New York’s indie filmmaking world. (Holden)‘Tabu’ (No rating, 1:58, in Portuguese) The first half of Miguel Gomes’s elegant and elusive black-and-white film concerns a middle-aged woman living alone in present-day Lisbon, who is drawn into the life of her elderly neighbor. The second half tells, without dialogue, the story of that neighbor’s romantic adventures in the last years of Portuguese colonial rule in Africa. The mood of nostalgia — for old movies and for old social arrangements — is beguiling, if also somewhat coy. (Scott)‘This Is 40’ (R; 2:14) Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) play a Los Angeles married couple in Judd Apatow’s sloppy, generous and deeply personal new film. Facing the anxieties of approaching middle age and other related worries, they squabble, act out and wonder if they can find true happiness amid the almost unimaginable privilege they enjoy. (Scott)‘Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn — Part 2’ (PG-13. 1:55) Bella, Edward, Jacob and the rest of the fanged and furred gang say so long in this final chapter of the franchise juggernaut. The director Bill Condon, who shepherded “Part 1,” finishes up his tour of duty with some surprisingly energetic and flamboyant violence, and along the way makes the most of a game, fabulous Michael Sheen. (Dargis)‘Yossi’ (No rating, 1:24, in Hebrew) The sequel to the gay love story, “Yossi and Jagger,” a landmark of Israeli cinema, begins as a reasonably hardheaded look at profound cultural change but turns into a soft feel-good fantasy of romantic salvation. (Holden)★ ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow’s brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid. Written by Mark Boal, the movie is a seamless weave of truth and drama as well as a wrenchingly sad, soul-shaking story about revenge and its moral costs. See it, fight over it, but don’t ignore it. (Dargis)Film Series‘Dance on Camera 2013’ (Friday through Tuesday) The 17th annual edition of this popular Lincoln Center Festival presents a judicious mix of dance films new and old.

(Nate Chinen)Gregg August Sextet (Wednesday) The versatile bassist Gregg August has a worthy new album, “Four by Six,” which demonstrates his taste for assertive modernism. On the album he leads both a sextet and a quartet; the larger group, or a close facsimile, is the one that appears here, with John Bailey on trumpet, Yosvany Terry and John Ellis on saxophones, Xavier Davis on piano and Rudy Royston on drums. At 7, 9 and 10:30 p.m., Smoke, 2751 Broadway, at 106th Street, (212) 864-6662, smokejazz.com; no cover, $20 minimum for 10:30 p.m. show. (Chinen)★ Bobby Avey Group (Thursday) Not too long ago the proficient young pianist Bobby Avey released his auspicious debut. Here he presents a newer suite, “Authority Melts From Me,” inspired by the Haitian slave revolution around the turn of the 19th century, and supported by musicological research in Haiti. To help unpack the material, Mr. Avey enlists the alto saxophonist Miguel Zenón, whose own work reflects similar instincts; the guitarist Ben Monder; the bassist Thomson Kneeland; and the drummer Jordan Perlson. At 7:30 p.m., Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; $30, $25 for members, $15 for under 30. (Chinen)Patricia Barber Quartet (Friday and Saturday) Ms. Barber’s verbosity and arch intellectualism are uncommon traits for a jazz singer, and she has sometimes been held at arm’s length by wary traditionalists. Her new album, “Smash” (Concord Jazz), won’t change that dynamic — see “Redshift,” a bossa nova that addresses the ups and downs of romance in the language of astrophysics — but it’s a good showcase for her talents, and for the working band that she brings here, featuring the guitarist John Kregor, the bassist Larry Kohut and the drummer Jon Deitemyer. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $30. (Chinen)David Binney (Tuesday) Mr. Binney, an alto saxophonist, practices a brand of avant-gardism that embraces harmony, melody and rhythm, along with amplification. He appears in a companionable setting with a fully committed band: the keyboardist Jacob Sacks, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Dan Weiss. At 10 p.m., 55 Bar, 55 Christopher Street, West Village, (212) 929-9883, 55bar.com; $20. (Chinen)★ Ron Carter Quartet (Tuesday through Feb. 10) Ron Carter, one of jazz’s most highly regarded bassists, tends to favor polish over power in his small-group work, but that doesn’t mean his bands lack a vital spark. This one shouldn’t, anyway: it features a smartly intuitive pianist, Renee Rosnes, along with the drummer Payton Crossley and the percussionist Rolando Morales-Matos. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)Gerald Clayton Trio (Tuesday and Wednesday) Gerald Clayton, a pianist of great touch and soulful exposition, leads his excellent trio with the bassist Joe Sanders and the drummer Justin Brown.

Her partners, all adept with spontaneous texture, are the tenor saxophonist Ingrid Laubrock, the violist Mat Maneri, the bassist Eivind Opsvik and the drummer Tom Rainey. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Cornelia Street Café, 29 Cornelia Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 989-9319, corneliastreetcafe.com; $10 cover, with $10 minimum. (Chinen)Lou Donaldson Organ Quartet (Tuesday through Feb. 9) Last month, when the alto saxophonist Lou Donaldson received his official acknowledgment as a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Master, he dryly wondered aloud what had taken so long. The complaint, though offered in jest, wasn’t without its merits: Mr. Donaldson has been a bebop paragon and a boogaloo pioneer since the 1950s. He works here with his well-traveled organ combo. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Vince Giordano and the Nighthawks (Friday, Monday and Tuesday) The city’s most celebrated throwback dance orchestra — led by Mr. Giordano, a clean-as-a-whistle connoisseur of Jazz Age antiquity — has been booked for Friday night’s free centennial celebration of Grand Central Terminal, with the purpose of transforming the station’s main hall into a dance floor. Then it’s business as usual next week, with a standing engagement on Monday and Tuesday at Sofia’s. Friday from 8:15 to 9:30 p.m., Grand Central Terminal, grandcentralterminal.com; free.

For this engagement, the headliners, a husband-and-wife team, work with the veteran drummer Victor Lewis. At 8 and 10 p.m., Iridium Jazz Club, 1650 Broadway, at 51st Street, (212) 582-2121, theiridium.com; $35 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Jonathan Kreisberg (Wednesday) An adaptable postbop guitarist, Mr. Kreisberg has an album called “One” due out this month, and as its title implies, it’s a showcase for solo introspection. He’ll play some of that music here, but he’ll also lead a propulsive quartet with Will Vinson on saxophone and piano, Rick Rosato on bass and Colin Stranahan on drums. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $20 cover. (Chinen)Adam Larson Quintet (Friday) A self-assured young saxophonist now in the masters program at the Manhattan School of Music, Adam Larson celebrates the release of his debut album, “Simple Beauty,” leading an ensemble that draws from his peer group, with Nils Weinhold on guitar, Can Olgun on piano, Martin Nevin on bass and Guilhem Flouzat on drums. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, 1160 Broadway, fifth floor, at West 27th Street, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members. (Chinen)Giuseppi Logan Quartet (Thursday) Mr. Logan is an alto saxophonist whose promising start, on the mid-1960s free-jazz scene, was curtailed by a mysterious silence. (In one prominent accounting of the era he was said to have vanished; in fact he was homeless, having suffered the ravages of drug dependency.) His comeback has been lovingly chronicled, and championed by younger musicians like Matt Lavelle — who has organized this concert, and who will play fluegelhorn and alto clarinet in the band, alongside the bassist François Grillot and the drummer David Miller. (Also on the bill, playing a 9:30 p.m. set, is the cellist Gil Selinger.) At 8 p.m., Firehouse Space, 246 Frost Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (917) 709-7799, thefirehousespace.org; $10. (Chinen)Russ Lossing (Friday) As on his stark and moving recent solo-piano album, “Drum Music” (Sunnyside), Mr. Lossing pays homage to his former bandleader Paul Motian, who died in November 2011. This concert, originally scheduled for November but postponed in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy, comes courtesy of the Sound It Out series. At 8 p.m., Greenwich House Music School, 46 Barrow Street, West Village, (212) 242-4770, greenwichhouse.org; $12, $10 for students. (Chinen)Mulgrew Miller and Wingspan (Thursday through Feb. 10) Mr. Miller is a pianist with a refined but earthy style and a particular gift for the blues. In this ensemble, an extension of his working trio, he pursues an airier sensibility with help from the vibraphonist Steve Nelson, the trumpeter Duane Eubanks, the drummer Rodney Green and the alto saxophonist Antonio Hart. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $35 and $40 cover, $15 for students at select sets, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)Jason Palmer (Saturday) A trumpeter with a pristine tone and an admirable breadth of style — take a moment to consider the aesthetic distance between two alto saxophonists he works with, Matana Roberts and Grace Kelly — Mr. Palmer strikes his own stylistic balance here. His sidemen, most of them about as versatile as he is, are the tenor saxophonist Mark Shim, the alto saxophonist Godwin Louis, the pianist Leo Genovese, the bassist Edward Perez and the drummer E. J. Strickland. At 9 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Gallery at Salt Space, (212) 242-1063, jazzgallery.org; $20, $10 for members.

(Chinen)John Pizzarelli Quartet  (Friday and Saturday) You may have spotted John Pizzarelli on television with Paul McCartney at last year’s Grammy Awards ceremony, playing music from the former Beatle’s standards album. It’s yet one more example — along with his own recent album, “Rockin’ in Rhythm: A Tribute to Duke Ellington” (Telarc) — of how Mr. Pizzarelli, a charismatic singer as well as a crisp guitarist, has solidified his stature as a modern exemplar of jazz-rooted cabaret. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Chris Potter Quartet (Tuesday through Feb. 10) Chris Potter, a tenor saxophonist of sleek harmonic inquiry and superhuman technique, has an expressive new album, “The Sirens” (ECM), inspired by his recent rereading of “The Odyssey.” He first workshopped the music at the Village Vanguard, where he’s scheduled to make his return next week, with the bassist Larry Grenadier and the drummer Eric Harland (who appear on the album) and the pianist Ethan Iverson (who’s filling in for Craig Taborn). At 9 and 11 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)★ Dafnis Prieto Sextet (Thursday through Feb. 10) The Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto, an essential fixture on New York’s progressive Latin jazz scene, recently received a MacArthur fellowship, underscoring his focused ambition as a conceptualist and composer. Here he leads a group not unlike the one on his 2008 album, “Taking the Soul for a Walk” (Dafnison): Ralph Alessi on trumpet, Roman Filiu and Felipe Lamoglia on saxophones, Osmany Paredes on piano and Ben Street on bass. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set next Friday and Feb. 9, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 cover, $30 next Friday and Feb. 9.

He has been commissioned to play music inspired by the Tibetan art in the collection of the Rubin Museum; he’ll do so with help from the pianist Dan Tepfer, the bassist Linda Oh and the drummer Austin Walker. At 7 p.m., Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org; $20. (Chinen)Mike Rodriguez Quintet (Tuesday) A precise and resourceful trumpeter, Mike Rodriguez brings a sleek postbop modernity to his engagement with Latin jazz.

(Chinen)Roswell Rudd Quartet with Sunny Kim (Monday) Roswell Rudd is a spirited and wide-open trombonist, just as happy with a free-form rustle as he is with rambunctious swing. He seems most likely to draw here from “Keep Your Heart Right” (Sunnyside), with a quartet featuring Sunny Kim on vocals, Lafayette Harris on piano and Ken Filiano on bass. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., Dizzy’s Club Coca-Cola, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 258-9595, jalc.org; $25 cover, $10 for students, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)★ Cécile MCLorin Salvant (Saturday) A savvy, arresting young singer in the Sarah Vaughan-Abbey Lincoln lineage, Ms. Salvant was a relative unknown in the jazz world until she won the Thelonious Monk International Jazz Competition in 2010. She has a forthcoming album on the Mack Avenue label, and appears here under the auspices of Lincoln Center’s American Songbook series. At 8:30 p.m., Allen Room, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $30 to $225. (Chinen)Diane Schuur (Friday through Sunday) A flinty and irrepressible jazz singer, Ms. Schuur has a new album, “Live,” that offers a fair indication of what she’ll deliver here, with a band organized by the pianist Alan Broadbent and featuring Joel Frahm on saxophones, Romero Lubambo on guitar, Ben Wolfe on bass and Ulysses Owens Jr. on drums. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum.

Mr. Virelles presents this project at the Village Vanguard, where he has worked in bands led by the saxophonists Chris Potter and Mark Turner. He’ll have the same rhythm section as on the album: the bassist Ben Street, the percussionist-poet Román Díaz, the venerable drummer Andrew Cyrille.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/arts/spare-times-for-children-for-feb-1-7.html,"BAMKIDS FILM FESTIVALA pint-size werewolf, a wise witch, red and blue gnomes, several monsters and a dinosaur named Edwina will all crowd into the Brooklyn Academy of Music this weekend. But no need to worry: they’re almost all friendly, and they’re out to entertain.They will join animals — hamsters and pigs, especially — and many children as on-screen characters in the BAMkids Film Festival, whose 15th annual edition includes 76 international titles, with choices for cineastes as young as 2 and as old as 10.As always, the selections are divided by age group, with four shorts programs and three features each day. And while the festival, organized by Nicole Dreiske, executive director of the International Children’s Media Center, draws from vastly different cultures, it also taps into universal concerns.Like bullying. In “Alfie, the Little Werewolf,” a Dutch feature, the 7-year-old title character realizes why he’s always felt strange. Alfie’s brother then urges him to use his newfound powers against their school’s toughs. It’s about “how do you deal with inner anger, and how do you deal with being different,” said Suzanne Youngerman, the academy’s director of education and family programs. “In a Heartbeat,” an Icelandic short, focuses on a young outcast “who doesn’t do anything to assert herself until she sees someone else being bullied,” Ms. Youngerman said.Environmental issues emerge too. “Ploddy the Police Car Makes a Splash,” a Norwegian animated feature, pits a peppy little auto against corrupt corporate bigwigs stealing the water supply. “Collective Consciousness #6” (Brazil) uses paper animation to tell the two-minute odyssey of a piece of trash, while “Eskimal” (Mexico) devotes its nine minutes to illuminating threats to the Arctic.Some films delve deeply into fantasy, like the Czech feature “Kitty Mama,” whose title character is a benevolent witch, and the German feature “Laura’s Star and the Dream Monsters,” above, about a girl and her brother inside the boy’s dreamscape. In the 17-minute “Tick Tock Time Emporium” an “enigmatic shop owner sells time as gumballs,” Ms. Youngerman said. “You can buy more time, quality time, family time.”This American film’s director, Morgan Faust, and several cast members will spend time themselves, appearing for a discussion.In addition to filmmaker visits BAMkids will include movie workshops, concerts — by the Deedle Deedle Dees and the Suzi Shelton Band — and awards determined by audience voting: the Bammies, of course.(Saturday and Sunday, starting at 10 a.m., BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, 718-636-4100. Schedule: bam.org/programs. Tickets per screening: $12; $9 for 13 and under and 65+; $7 for BAM Cinema Club members. Concerts, $9.) LAUREL GRAEBERFor Children ‘The Adventures of Maya the Bee’ (Saturday) This feisty puppet heroine has buzzed back to the Culture Project, where her journey began a dozen years ago. Based on a children’s book by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, “The Adventures of Maya the Bee” relates the title character’s flight from the hive in search of tastes more exotic than honey. The revival has new sets and props, but the same intricate rod and shadow puppets designed by Zofia Czechlewska. Adapted by Rachel Klein, with a score and lyrics by the jazz artist Nancy Harrow, who also conceived the show, “Maya” is a jazz musical for children, and how often do you encounter those? (The run is open-ended.) Saturdays at 10:30 a.m., 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org; $25.‘The African Drum’ (Saturday) Shadow Box Theater’s multimedia presentation of traditional African tales features characters that include a talking leopard, a wise loon and a turtle that is just as resourceful as the hero of “The Tortoise and the Hare.” All are shadow puppets, manipulated behind a lighted screen so that the colorful animals appear to be frolicking in the grasslands. With story and music by Sandra Robbins, the production focuses on Kijana, a little girl who relates the narratives and has her own brush with danger. (Also Feb. 10 at the National Black Theater in Manhattan.) At 11 a.m., P.S. 3, the Bedford Village School, 50 Jefferson Avenue, between Bedford and Franklin Avenues, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn (entrance at the back of the school, on Hancock Street); (212) 724-0677, shadowboxtheatre.org; $10 in advance; $15 at the door. Reservations requested.‘Archaeology Zone: Discovering Treasures From Playgrounds to Palaces’ (Friday, Sunday through Tuesday, and Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this permanent exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays and to 4 p.m. on Fridays; 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org.

This question frequently comes to mind when viewing the complex animation in some of today’s films, and now the Museum of the Moving Image offers visitors an answer for one of those movies: “Rise of the Guardians,” a recent DreamWorks release. This new exhibition consists of more than 25 original drawings and sketches, along with design materials, production artifacts and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film, an adventure about immortal heroes like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. (Through March 3.) The show is accompanied by a retrospective weekend screening series of DreamWorks films. This weekend the film at 1 p.m. is the animated “Shrek the Third,” in which the lovable ogre of the title stands to inherit the kingdom of Far Far Away.

The fun will include a noon lion dance (snakes won’t mind), as well as dance workshops from the United East Athletic Association and the ensemble Red Silk Dancers.

This musical from Vital Theater Company focuses on a little girl who wants everything to be fancy — especially herself. Based on the book series written by Jane O’Connor and illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser, the production explores the predicament that ensues when Nancy finds out that she hasn’t been cast as the glamorous mermaid she’d hoped to be in the coming dance show. With a book by Susan DiLallo, a score by Danny Abosch, and lyrics by both, the musical humorously follows Nancy’s attempts to cope with a most unfancy role: that of a tree.

At 11 a.m., 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $7.‘Flight of the Butterflies’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to think of the graceful creatures that are the subject of this fascinating film as traveling only short distances, flitting from flower to flower. But half a billion monarch butterflies actually migrate 3,000 miles every fall, to Mexico from Canada. A new Imax movie, this project chronicles their journey and the 40-year investigation of it by one impassioned scientist, Fred A. Urquhart. (Through July 7.)

Productions. Inspired by Washington Irving’s “Legend of Sleepy Hollow” and recommended for theatergoers older than 8, this show, by Michael Sgouros and Brenda Bell, focuses on the love triangle and the mystery inherent in Irving’s tale.

At 5:30 p.m., Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, at Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, hollowthemusical.com; $35 to $50.Illuminated: A Winter Festival (Saturday and Sunday) Winter days are dark in Scandinavia, but that doesn’t bother the Swedes: they create their own light with bright seasonal traditions. Now the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is following suit with its new Illuminated festival, part of its Light in Winter event series. On Saturday, the second weekend of the festivities, the theme is “Inner Child,” with a pop-up winter lodge for families. The fun will include storytelling, face painting, art activities (including making a mandala out of recycled materials) and outdoor Swedish schoolyard games. Sunday is devoted to “Birdies & Trolls,” with an emphasis on nature. Children can go on an hourlong Winter Bird Stroll, make a pine-needle pillow to take home, listen to Swedish folk tales and take part in a closing ceremony for the mandala. Saturday from noon to 5 p.m.; Sunday from noon to 6:30 p.m.; 1000 Washington Avenue, at Eastern Parkway, Prospect Heights, (718) 623-7200, bbg.org/illuminated. Free with garden admission: $10; $5 for students and 65+; free for under 12 and members.Jazz for Kids (Sunday) Every Sunday during most of the school year the Jazz Standard presents not just jazz for kids, but also jazz by kids: the featured players at its Sunday brunches are the members of the Jazz Standard Youth Orchestra, a group of talented young people ages 11 to 18. In this series, which is celebrating its 10th year, the musicians play new arrangements of big-band classics while listeners enjoy barbecue offerings that include a children’s menu. (Through May 13.) Doors open at 1 p.m.; shows are from 1:30 to 3 p.m.; 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net/mobi/kids. Free; in lieu of a cover charge, guests make a $5 donation, which benefits the Jazz Standard Discovery Program, an initiative that brings musical performances to city schools.Kidrockers (Sunday) It’s hard to imagine mature, self-respecting, childless adults wanting — much less needing — to sneak into a kids’ show. But consider that the groups playing at the concerts Beth Lorge produces (for ages 3 to 13) are hot or up-and-coming rock and pop bands, and you can understand why she’s seen it happen. On Sunday she’s presenting Hooray for Earth, a New York rock band whose title track from its debut album, “True Loves,” has been featured in the soundtrack for a video game. (If that isn’t a selling point for kids, what is?) Reputante, a four-man group from Brooklyn soon to tour nationally with the Maccabees, will also play. At 11:30 a.m. (doors open at 11), Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, between North 11th and 12th Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 963-3369, kidrockers.com; $8; $20 for a family four-pack, available by advance purchase only.‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’ (Saturday) If the children of the Pevensie family could travel to the magical land of Narnia through something as simple as a wardrobe, why shouldn’t two hard-working actors be able to play them and all the characters found there? That’s what Catherine Fowles and Jara Jones are attempting in Off Broadway Family Theater’s first production, le Clanché du Rand’s adaptation of C. S. Lewis’s classic novel. (The run is open-ended.) At 11 a.m., St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, narniaoffbroadway.com; $35.‘The Little Moon Theater’ (Saturday, Sunday and Wednesday) The troupe of the title provides more than entertainment: its productions also grant wishes, solving problems or healing hearts with a carefully chosen play. Now Tada! Youth Theater will take over those roles in this revival of “The Little Moon Theater,” a musical based on the children’s book by Irene Haas. With a book by Michael Slade and music and lyrics by Joel Gelpe, the show also focuses on someone who has trouble granting wishes: Penelope, a bumbling fairy godmother who needs some extra help. (Through Feb. 16.) Saturdays and Sundays at 2 and 4 p.m.; also this Wednesday at 10 a.m. and noon (noon is sold out); Tada! Theater, 15 West 28th Street, Manhattan, (212) 252-1619, Ext. 128, tadatheater.com; $20; $8 for 16 and under; $25 and $15 for premium seats.Lunar New Year at the Children’s Museum of the Arts (Saturday and Sunday) Snakes can’t exactly dance, but human beings will make up for that by honoring them with a wide range of fancy footwork at this celebration ushering in the Year of the Snake. Performances will include ribbon dancing, handkerchief dancing, sword dancing, lion dancing and Mongolian bowl dancing. Children can also enjoy Chinese music, take part in crafts — including designing clay and cut-and-fold snakes — and join in a parade that incorporates a huge snake costume.

The artist and teacher Paul Deo, who comes from that city, is visiting Wave Hill, the public garden in the Bronx, and he’s brought the art and the spirit of the carnival with him. In this weekend’s drop-in family art project, he will help children make a parasol, a hat, a nature mask or a bead necklace to use in a colorful indoor parade: a mini Mardi Gras. From 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., West 249th Street and Independence Avenue, Riverdale, (718) 549-3200, wavehill.org. Free with admission: $8; $4 for students and 65+; $2 for ages 6 through 18; free to under 6 and members and to all on Saturdays until noon.‘Monkey King: A Story From China’ (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The Children’s Museum of Manhattan has welcomed back a mischievous hero: Monkey King, the star of this exhibition, which has traveled many miles for years, just like the character it centers on. The interactive show, inspired by the Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” recreates many of the Monkey’s adventures, like fighting the Bull Demon at a station that resembles a video game. Much of the fun teaches Chinese values: cooperation, perseverance, bravery and self-sacrifice. (Through May.)

The Museum of the City of New York is offering this family program in conjunction with its new exhibition, “Making Room,” which features a full-scale micro studio (325 square feet) equipped with multipurpose, adaptable and sometimes hidden furnishings and equipment. Children will investigate the pieces in the show and then create their own room models incorporating transformable designs. From noon to 2 p.m., Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (917) 492-3371, mcny.org. Free with suggested museum admission: $10; $6 for students and 65+; $20 for families (with a maximum of two adults); free for ages 12 and under. Reservations required.‘The Paper Bag Players Saddles and Sunshine’ (Saturday and Sunday) Robert Frost knew that good fences don’t always make good neighbors; sometimes what you really need is a bear. You can learn the reason in this wonderful new show from the Paper Bag Players, in which everything is fresh out of the bag: they’re presenting all new material, written by the actors and the artistic director, Ted Brackett. They’re still making magic out of cardboard and brown wrapping paper in these musically enhanced and highly interactive skits for ages 3 to 9, several of them with a Wild West slant. (The show moves to Symphony Space on Feb. 9 and 10.) At 2 p.m., Kaye Playhouse, Hunter College, 68th Street between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 772-4448, thepaperbagplayers.org; $15 to $30.‘Perfect Catch: A Throwmantic Comedy’ (Saturday and Sunday) Love has a lot to do with finding a perfect catch, but in this family show, being revived as part of Canal Park Playhouse’s Classic Brunch Matinee series, the catching part is particularly important. Jen Slaw and Michael Karas, jugglers and circus performers, play co-workers who at first don’t like each other but share a mutual love of office pranks. Before long sparks — and a lot of other things — start to fly. (Through Feb. 24.) At 1 and 4 p.m., Canal Park Playhouse, 508 Canal Street, between Greenwich and Washington Streets, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, canalparkplayhouse.com; $20; brunch is available at the theater’s Waffle Iron Cafe before or after the show.‘Pippi’ (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Children’s literature had at least one feminist heroine long before the feminist era: Pippi Longstocking, the pint-size, pigtailed, redheaded dynamo who lived independently and fought off villains with the help of pluck and superhuman strength. Now the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater is reviving its 2007 musical based on the Pippi stories by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. With a book by Zakiyyah Alexander and a score by Daryl Kojak, the production features almost two dozen handmade marionettes. Weekdays at 10:30 a.m. and noon, with an additional Wednesday performance at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m.; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org/arts; $8; $5 for ages 12 and under.

As envisioned by the artist, hip-hop pioneer and early graffiti writer who called himself Rammellzee, it is a science-fiction fantasy world populated by heroes and monsters whose elaborate costumes and masks Rammellzee often made from found materials. The Children’s Museum of the Arts has recreated the universe of Rammellzee, who died in 2010, in this exhibition, which closes on Sunday. It includes his performance videos and audio recordings as well as his paintings and objects. Hung from the ceiling are his Letter Racers, letters of the alphabet imagined as military vehicles, ready to rebel from language. Daily art workshops encourage children to explore his ideas. At 103 Charlton Street, between Hudson and Greenwich Streets, South Village, (212) 274-0986, cmany.org.

While Toshi looks for a treasured heirloom, she is visited by her female ancestors, including slaves who stitched the quilts referred to in the title: called “show ways,” they had hidden symbols revealing the routes of the Underground Railroad.

At this event, part of the Thalia Kids’ Book Club series, the actor Sarah Steele will read an excerpt from the book, which concerns Harriet’s habit of observing those around her and writing all her impressions down in a notebook — until that notebook falls into the wrong hands. The authors Kirsten Miller, Michael Buckley and Rebecca Stead will lead a discussion of the novel, which was groundbreaking in its depiction of preteen life.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/arts/music/little-time-to-prepare-now-a-legacy-to-keep.html,"On a recent cold and rainy afternoon, Pretty Yende sat on a couch in the press room of the Metropolitan Opera House, retracing the path that took her from a childhood in South Africa to her acclaimed Met debut last month. On Jan. 17 she received a raucous standing ovation from the audience after singing Adèle in Rossini’s “Comte Ory” opposite the star tenor Juan Diego Flórez. Now, dressed in leggings and boots and wearing rimless, flexible glasses that resisted her frequent attempts to fix them in place, Ms. Yende, a 27-year-old soprano, looked more like a graduate student than like a diva.In the interview, this self-described “church girl” from Piet Retief, a timber- and paper-producing town near the border with Swaziland, was poised and quick to laugh, modest but quietly confident. She sings Adèle two more times at the Met, on Saturday and Tuesday. Since Ms. Yende’s debut, her phone has been ringing with offers from agents. So far, she said, she has turned them all down.“This is my year to study,” she said. “It’s a Verdi and Wagner season, and I don’t have so much Verdi or Wagner.” Then she added, with a giggle, “ Yet.” She is studying the title role of Donizetti’s “Lucia di Lammermoor” with the venerable bel canto singer Mariella Devia; Ms. Yende plans to move to Paris and learn to speak French.“Prima la salute, poi la musica,” she said in accent-free Italian, which she learned over the past three years while studying at La Scala’s Academy of Lyric Opera in Milan: “Health first, music second.”Ms. Yende said she needed courage to accept the Met’s offer to step in for Nino Machaidze, the soprano who had been scheduled to sing Adèle but fell ill. The call came a mere month before opening night, and because of communication delays and visa troubles, Ms. Yende had effectively just one week to learn the part.“I had never heard the opera before,” she said. “So when I got the call, I said, how can I say yes? But when I looked at the score, I thought, ah. It’s not like a Susanna, where you have many recitatives. It’s ensemble work. And it’s beautiful music, which got into my ear quite quickly. I knew that I could do it, you see.”What she couldn’t have foreseen was the manner in which she would make her first entrance: stumbling down a flight of steps after a brief pantomime appearance during the overture and falling hard on her hands and knees, to the gasps of audience members. But instead of shaking her up, she said, the fall helped release tension, as she saw its comic aspect.“I thought, why am I laughing? I have a huge aria to sing, and now I’ve bruised myself. But I guess there had to be something that pulled the whole mind to one place. And it had to be the fall.”Singing at the Met, she said, “takes a lot of courage, but also a lot of humility, because people come from all over the world just to hear you. God knows why; people are going through a lot of things. We have this gift of music, and to be able to share that takes a huge responsibility. And probably I had to be reminded that I am entering a zone where I am actually going to be carrying that responsibility, and I should just remember to keep my feet on the ground.”Ms. Yende credited her education in South Africa with giving her that grounding. “When you are young and hungry to learn, it is easy to lose your way if you don’t have the root already. Virginia Davids, my singing teacher, gave me a good backbone. As we know, singing is a mind game. If you mess up with the mind, it is really hard to crack it.”Ms. Yende’s combination of musical talent and mental toughness and acuity also impressed Ilias Tzempetonidis, the casting manager of La Scala, who discovered Ms. Yende in 2009 at the Belvedere Singing Competition in Vienna. There she swept up all the top prizes.“All of us in the jury realized that there was a diamond there,” he said by phone from Milan. When Ms. Yende joined the Academy at La Scala, he closely followed her development and was impressed with her dedication. In three years, he said, she attended every rehearsal in the opera house, watching and listening.“It shows how devoted she is,” he said. “I told her, ‘You are soon going to be in a position to fly, and when you open your wings, you are going to fly all over.’ She has this incredible charisma and this beautiful voice. When she sings, you think she sings for you.”Ms. Yende first heard opera as a teenager, when she saw an ad for British Airways on television and was enchanted by its music, a duet from Delibes’s “Lakmé.” A year and a half later, at 16, she won a choral award that allowed her to travel to Cape Town and audition for the singing program at the South African College of Music at that city’s university.Angelo Gobbato, the chief executive officer of Cape Town Opera and the director of the university’s opera school, remembered his first impression of the teenage Ms. Yende.“We were all very taken by the beauty of the voice, this very clear sound, and at the same time this luminous, very lighthearted personality onstage,” he said by phone from Cape Town.Ms. Yende’s voice teacher, Ms. Davids, was the first black woman, and one of the few singers considered colored, or mixed race, who appeared on opera stages in South Africa during the apartheid years. Today she teaches a new generation of black singers, many of whom come from townships all over the country.“The African voice is a strange phenomenon,” Ms. Davids said in a phone interview from Cape Town. “It has a lot of resonance. Singing is such a big part of life for people: when they are happy, they sing; when they are sad, they sing. It’s a completely physical experience. When the young artists come to study with me, they already have that physical support.”Mr. Gobbato, who was born in Milan, compares rural South Africa to the Europe of Verdi and Wagner, “where people had to shout to each other across the fields.”“It’s that sort of spinto,” he continued, “that instinct to use the voice as a huge communication instrument.”Above all, Ms. Yende said, South Africa is “a singing nation.”“Music is something that we are born with,” she observed. “It’s like the African rhythm; it’s like a heartbeat. In Sunday school you will have to sing one song, and a little girl will start harmonizing it. Just like that, just by hearing. It’s that kind of world.”Ms. Yende is not the only one from that world to make her mark on international opera stages. Among Ms. Davids’s students are Pumeza Matshikiza, a soprano who has performed at Covent Garden in London and now works at the opera house in Stuttgart, Germany, and Musa Ngqungwana, a bass-baritone now studying at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia. The soprano Tsakane Valentine Maswanganyi, who has performed at the Deutsche Oper in Berlin, has spoken about the hardships of her childhood in a township in Soweto.“People are surprised to see these great singers come out of these townships, “ Ms. Davids said. “I say they were always there, but they were being ignored.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/arts/music/david-virelles-continuum-at-the-village-vanguard.html,"You might have to contain your need for immediate comprehension when you hear David Virelles’s music at the Village Vanguard this week. It won’t slot easily into what you know.There’s much in it that is composed and precise, but it comes in episodes that aren’t clearly marked or forecast, in great, shifting stacks of musical language. It’s got roots in the open-ended jazz of Andrew Hill and Cecil Taylor, in Afro-Cuban rumba, and, in bits and pieces, contemporary classical music; maybe even Bill Evans too.But cumulatively it sounds apart from all of that. It’s not free jazz, but it roams all over the place.Mr. Virelles is a young Cuban-born pianist who has moved quickly within New York jazz circles since he arrived in 2009. (He’s already played at the Vanguard in bands led by Mark Turner, Chris Potter and Ravi Coltrane.) His own band, Continuum, includes Ben Street on bass, Andrew Cyrille on drums and Román Díaz as a kind of drum-and-voice integrated hybrid: conga playing, chanted singing, rhythmic poetry.The alto saxophonist Román Filiú briefly joined the quartet on Tuesday and will again over the weekend; in Thursday’s second set, the saxophonist and composer Henry Threadgill, one of Mr. Virelles’s mentors, was the fifth member, playing his own music with the band.This group is evolving: that’s both a judgment and a description. What it played in its first set on Tuesday night seemed to me far more settled and confident than what I heard 16 months ago at the Jazz Gallery, when the group really was new. Its sound will grow stronger by the end of the week — I’m almost certain of that.But there is also a real-time evolution that’s intrinsic to this music. It’s always on the way to becoming something else; that may be why it gives the impression of having no clear antecedents.Mr. Díaz is not a detachable part of the project, as percussionists sometimes can be in ensembles that you hear at jazz clubs. He’s at the center of it. A former member of the Cuban rumba group Yoruba Andabo, he’s been a New Yorker since the late ’90s, a performer and a scholar. At times during the set, when he floated a slow chant over a fast drum rhythm or when he improvised some Afro-Cuban chanting, something was being enacted. All music is ritual, but this, at times, felt more so.And Mr. Cyrille, who is 73, is a whole other story: a New York jazz drummer of Haitian roots who learned on the bandstand in the 1950s with Coleman Hawkins and Nellie Lutcher, then played through half a century of changes in experimental jazz. From the start on Tuesday, his playing was generous: light and specific syncopated cymbal and tom-tom hits, bubbling permutations of six-eight rhythm, everything in loose combination with Mr. Díaz and Mr. Street. It was vaguely Antillean, vaguely swinging, funky in quiet ways, unlimited by the history of trap-set drumming or rumba or really anything else.Mr. Virelles’s slowly unfolding compositions, some of which came from his recent album with the group (“Continuum,” on Pi Recordings) and some of which were new, cast a shadowy, mysterious feeling in the room. As they changed, he fed them with percussive playing, delicate harmonies and clusters played carefully with a flat hand or a forearm.He’s never haphazard: he’s got a sure touch and multiple musical vocabularies, of which he seems determined to create a synthesis that isn’t schematic or obvious. That he’s choosing to perplex a little, rather than dazzle you, might be one of the best reasons to see him."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/us/secret-service-director-is-retiring.html,"Mark Sullivan, the director of the Secret Service, will retire this month, an agency spokesman said on Friday. Mr. Sullivan, who was in charge of the agency when it was embroiled in a scandal involving prostitutes in Colombia last year, will step down on Feb. 22 after almost three decades with the service. He joined the service as a special agent with the Detroit office in 1983 and rose to become the director of the agency in 2006. He went before Congress last year and apologized for the misconduct of employees who took prostitutes back to their hotel rooms before a visit by President Obama to the Colombian resort of Cartagena."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/sports/basketball/knicks-tyson-chandler-awakens-on-offense.html,"In contrast with most games this season, the Knicks’ main objective in the first quarter of their victory over the Orlando Magic on Wednesday was not to get Carmelo Anthony into an offensive rhythm.Raymond Felton took the bulk of the shots in the quarter, yet he was not Coach Mike Woodson’s focal point, either. Woodson was curious to see how Tyson Chandler would play in the opening 12 minutes.Chandler knew Woodson was watching him closely. They had talked at Tuesday’s practice. In Woodson’s opinion, Chandler had been passive on offense and was too worried about getting into foul trouble.“He told me: ‘Look, you need to get more aggressive. Demand the ball. Get more active out there,’ ” Chandler said of Woodson’s message.Chandler responded by scoring 9 of his team-high 21 points in the first quarter with layups and hook shots. He was strong with the ball and showed quickness when he ran pick-and-rolls with Felton, which is what the pair did with great success before Felton missed a month with a fractured right pinkie finger.It was the first time Chandler led the Knicks in scoring this season.Before Wednesday’s game, Chandler had attempted just nine shots in the previous four games. The Knicks went 2-2 in that stretch, and Chandler did not score in double figures in any of the games. Against the Magic, Chandler improved his N.B.A.-leading field-goal percentage to 68.6 percent from 67.7 percent by going 10 of 11 from the floor. His only miss came in the second quarter when a seven-foot jumper — his farthest attempt of the game — bounced off the front of the rim.“I had a couple of rough games,” Chandler said. “I really wanted to get in the offense early, so I came out and made it a point to be aggressive. The floor was spread, and my teammates were looking for me. We have such great shooters it’s hard to leave them to help on me.”Chandler, a 7-foot-1 center, is averaging 11.9 points a game this season. His career high in a full season was 11.8 with the New Orleans Hornets in 2007-08.In Woodson’s offense, Chandler is responsible for setting picks and screening off defenders to give his teammates room to dribble into the paint. That allows teammates to shoot the ball or create a mismatch for Chandler near the basket. When Woodson watched film of the four games in which Chandler was all but missing on offense, he saw Chandler was not setting picks for the ball handler quickly, which in turn did not force his defender to leave him for the faster guard.Woodson had a simple way of describing the difference in Chandler’s play. In the previous four games, Woodson said, Chandler did not look like an all-star. On Wednesday, he did.“When you’re voted as an all-star, that’s how you’ve got to play each time you step out on the floor,” Woodson said. “There’s no excuses. I just didn’t think that he was playing at that level, especially on the offensive end. He wasn’t playing with any pace, and I thought last night he had a little pep to his step in terms of pace.”To Woodson’s credit, Chandler was so engaged in the offense against the Magic that he even became a playmaker in the second half. Chandler scored 6 points and had 3 of a season-high 5 assists in the third quarter.He showed he could play well on offense with both Anthony and Amar’e Stoudemire on the floor with him. Stoudemire, who now focuses on scoring in the low post, and Chandler displayed strong interior passing to each other that made it difficult for the Magic to double team either of them.“Anytime you can have another opposing offensive threat on the court, it’s going to help us,” Stoudemire said of Chandler. He added: “Tyson did a great job last night of establishing post position and finishing over the top with jump hooks. Those are moves that are much appreciated because we love to see him involved in the offense.”Anthony, who has led the team in scoring 32 times this season, said: “Tyson looked good. We need him to shoot that hook a little bit more. Anytime he can get 20 or so points and can go 10 of 11 from the field, that definitely puts us over the top.”It did against the Magic. Woodson said he expected Chandler to continue his strong play on offense against the Milwaukee Bucks on Friday. And this time, Woodson will not have a one-on-one meeting with Chandler before the game.“Tyson’s a pro,” Woodson said. “He’s always been willing to listen and willing to learn and do what’s asked of him.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/nyregion/paying-tribute-to-edward-koch-at-the-movie-theater.html,"“He loved New York like no other mayor I can remember before or after. And people felt it.”That description of Edward I. Koch by Jay Sachs surely would have brought a smile to the former mayor’s face.Mr. Sachs, 70, was leaving an early morning showing of the documentary film “Koch,” which opened nationwide on Friday — the same day that Mr. Koch died.As it was for many who attended the showing at the Lincoln Plaza Cinemas on the Upper West Side or the Angelika theater in Lower Manhattan, watching the film was a tribute of sorts – a way to remember both the mayor and the city he led for more than a decade.“I woke up this morning and saw the news on New York 1,” Mr. Sachs said, referring to the news channel and station where Mr. Koch offered his views on political matters large and small long after he left office.New York might be a big city, but New Yorkers have an intimate relationship with their mayors. And, when it came to Mr. Koch, nearly everyone attending the documentary seemed to have a personal recollection.“I remember being struck by how tall he was,” said Nancy Jennings, 65, who met Mr. Koch briefly at a meeting of a bar association and then, she said, bumped into him often at restaurants.“While I was not always a fan of him politically, I am a big fan of him personally,” she said.In the documentary, it is clear that Mr. Koch gave a lot of thought to how he would be remembered. He is shown visiting his own grave site at Trinity Church Cemetery in Manhattan.“I am not afraid of death,” Mr. Koch says in the film. He said he believed that people would be judged in death — some rewarded, some not.“I expect to be rewarded,” he said with a smile, provoking laughter from the crowd in the darkened theater.Neil Barsky, the director of the film who spent several years with Mr. Koch documenting his life, was emotional after Friday morning’s showing at Lincoln Plaza.“It’s a surreal day,” he said. “It’s a strange day. For him to pass on the day of the opening...” he said before trailing off.“I wish it hadn’t happened,” he said.Hendrik Hertzberg, a writer for The New Yorker magazine, said he decided to attend the movie after hearing the news of Mr. Koch’s death.“He is lucky for having this to remember him by,” Mr. Hertzberg said. “It is a warts-and-all portrayal.” The “all,” he said, far outweighing the “warts.”For those who are not New Yorkers, Mr. Koch often seemed the embodiment of the city.Milton Lewis lives in Ontario, Canada, but said, “In my soul, I am a New Yorker.”And, for him, Mr. Koch was New York.“The humanity, the integrity,” he said. “In light of his death, I thought this was the best way to honor him.”Many of those who attended the movie on Friday morning were old enough to remember the city Mr. Koch inherited and how it changed during his tenure and in the years after he left office.Martin Grossman, 72, remembered Mr. Koch fondly – despite being indirectly insulted by the former mayor.“I remember when he said, ‘Teaching is the best part-time job I know about,'” recalled Mr. Grossman, a former history teacher.“He was very straightforward, and he told it the way it is,” he said.As the film vividly depicts, New York City in the 1970s and 1980s was riven by racial tension and a fiscal crisis.“Things were bad, with ‘drop dead New York’ and all the problems,” Mr. Grossman said. “The city was sort of going through a depression.”But Mr. Koch helped restore the city’s self-confidence, he said.“I thought he kept the city together,” he said. “He was a tough mayor. He did not cave to the pressure groups.”Mr. Grossman was attending the morning showing at the Angelika theater, where Mr. Koch, a movie buff, was known to take in a show.Never one to shy away from the spotlight, Mr. Koch would most likely have been delighted that reporters outnumbered moviegoers at the theater before the 10:45 a.m. screening.Tom Cunningham had already decided to see the movie before he heard the news.“It is sad,” he said. “But with his being in and out of the hospital, it was not really a surprise.”Mr. Cunningham, 69, was living in New York City’s suburbs in the 1970s and 1980s. “Or, as Koch would call it, the boring part of the world,” he said.When he moved to the city he moved to an apartment just a block north of Mr. Koch’s home.“I would see him out and about on the street,” he said. He was full of life, he said, quick with a smile and a hello.His love for the city, he said, was demonstrated in his choice of cemetery.“I remember when he bought his grave in the city,” he said, recalling Mr. Koch’s words at the time. “'Now I will be forever in Manhattan.'”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/arts/music/future-young-scooter-trinidad-james-and-atlanta-rap.html,"Years ago Atlanta took control of hip-hop’s center, both geographically and sonically. But as the hub of the genre, it’s been a steadily moving target, far more volatile than New York or Los Angeles ever were in their heyday. Trap music, snap music, strip club anthems: Atlanta can be almost anything it sets its mind to.Sometimes the city surprises itself. Certainly that’s been the case with the rise of the rapper-singer Future, who two years ago was making street-oriented strip club anthems and has now become an auteur of digital voice processing, turning his breathy bark into something that melts, spreading out over beats, filling in all the crevices. He’s something beyond mere rapping or even singing — he’s an original. Call it the New Weird Atlanta.On his new mixtape, “Future Presents F.B.G. the Movie,” Future — along with the members of his FreeBandz crew — put that style on full display. It’s the fullest exposition of his sound, even more so than last year’s excellent but transitional “Pluto.”Here it’s not what he says, but how. On “Ceelo” his voice is dragged out into taffylike stretches, and on “Karate Chop” he spits in terse phrases, just one or two syllables at a time.The digital effects are as mesmerizing as ever, making Future sound as if he were in agony and celebrating all at once. “Finessin” is exuberant, and “Chosen One” is melancholy, and the songs sound as if they came from the same miasma. It’s an accomplishment.His virus is spreading. Future was part of the most emotionally affecting song (“Loveeeeeee Song”) on Rihanna’s most recent album, and he’s a highlight on the new Juelz Santana mixtape. Superficially, his viral spread into the more conventional corners of R&B and hip-hop isn’t dissimilar to the one executed by T-Pain in the 2007-8 era. But T-Pain was more of a literalist, and more directly indebted to the talkbox tradition of the funk innovator Roger Troutman. Future is far stranger, less emotionally reliable and more sonically novel.He’s also building a team that’s imbibing at least some of his lessons, as seen on “Street Lottery,” the recent mixtape by the FreeBandz member Young Scooter. Topically, Young Scooter is more straightforward than the boss, but their collaborations here, like “Jugg Season” and “Julio,” are strong, and elsewhere, Young Scooter takes Future’s left-field approach and sandpapers off the rough edges, keeping the odd melodies and losing the digital afterburn.Future’s style is also simpatico with the last couple of mixtapes by Young Thug, which take the same outlier ideas far past musicality into far spookier territory. And certainly others in Atlanta will pick up on Future’s ideas soon.But there is a different strain of eccentricity threatening to shout that evolution down, as seen in Trinidad James, the city’s fastest-rising star, who may or may not have enough helium to stay afloat beyond his born-of-the-Internet hit “All Gold Everything.” In the video, one of the most striking of last year, Mr. James dresses flamboyantly, in flowy leopard-print shirt and velvet slippers, and marches around with some mean-looking friends.Mr. James is part of a different new Atlanta, although one that seems weird only from a distance. He performed at S.O.B.’s on Wednesday in the latest in a spate of New York shows that have followed the speedy crossover success of “All Gold Everything,” which has become a hit on radio with uncommon speed, probably thanks to Mr. James’s coining of hip-hop’s late-2012 catchphrase: “Popped a molly, I’m sweatin’/Woooo!” (Molly is a version of Ecstasy known for its purity.)“All Gold Everything” appeared on Mr. James’s debut mixtape, “Don’t Be S.A.F.E.,” which was released last July. Mr. James has a couple of ideas, but maybe only a couple. As a rapper, he’s serviceable and deliberate, which means he’s tentative. No recent hip-hop hit is as slow as “All Gold Everything,” which, depending on how you look at it, is either a savvy aesthetic choice or the only one he has.Mr. James leans heavily on his catchphrases, but he’s in on the joke, or at least wants to seem that he is. On Wednesday the rapper Problem released a song called “My Last Molly Song Ever, I Promise,” which featured a verse from Mr. James.But mostly he’s a walking anime character, an eccentric in presentation far more than in sound. The more telling video than “All Gold Everything” is the one for “Gold on My MacBook,” in which a gentle-looking Mr. James regards himself in the mirror before slowly putting on all the accouterments of his new look — chunky gold rings and bracelets, gold fronts on his teeth, loud red sunglasses — as if he were dressing up as Big Gipp for Halloween.Which is to say, there is a human being underneath all those fireworks. To his credit, at S.O.B.’s even Mr. James appeared a little fatigued by himself in a slow-motion set that couldn’t possibly match the rapid rise of “All Gold Everything” as a meme.Now that song’s just a regular rap hit and soon it’ll be a crutch: Mr. James repeatedly returned to the song’s refrain throughout the half-hour set and performed the song in full twice to close the night. But he had more enthusiasm for his not-yet-hits with equally sticky catchphrases: “Females Welcomed” and “One More Molly.”The next day he was back in Atlanta, filming the video for the “All Gold Everything” remix with a slew of Atlanta all-stars of various generations: T.I., Young Jeezy, 2 Chainz. It was Atlanta as it has been, not as it will be."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/world/europe/german-legislators-vote-to-outlaw-bestiality.html,"BERLIN — Germany’s upper house of Parliament, the Bundesrat, voted Friday to criminalize for the first time “using an animal for personal sexual activities” and to punish offenders with fines of as much as $34,000. It was the final legislative hurdle for a bill the lower house passed in December.The vote follows months of debate that pitted zoophiles against animal rights and protection advocates. Sexual mores seemed not to play a paramount role.The ban, which carries only a misdemeanor charge, is an amendment to the country’s animal protection law, multifaceted legislation that, among other things, regulates animal testing and the sale of animals and prohibits animal abuse, including “using an animal for personal sexual activities or making them available to third parties for sexual activities and thereby forcing them to behave in ways that are inappropriate to their species.”Zoophiles argue that their relationships with their pets, or “partners” as they prefer, are entirely mutual. Michael Kiok, a director of the advocacy group Zoophilic Engagement for Tolerance and Enlightenment, who now finds himself the de facto face of zoophilia in Germany, says animals are perfectly capable of expressing whether or not they desire sex.Animal-rights groups have criticized men like Mr. Kiok, saying they put defenseless creatures in harm’s way.But David Zimmermann, an animal caretaker who is also a director of the zoophilic group, said: “It’s a sexual aspect that is entirely foreign to most people. They just see a man and think, ‘What terrible things is he doing to that dog?’ ”Mr. Zimmermann had a Great Dane with which he occasionally had sex, but it died four months ago, he said. Now he lives with his similarly zoophilic boyfriend and their Dalmatian.“For me she’s just a good friend that I care about very, very much — there’s no sex,” Mr. Zimmermann said after a recent screening here of a documentary-style film on zoophilia that depicted fictitious characters like a pornography star with sexual feelings for cats and a butcher who fell in love with a pig.The film was shown in a stuffy cinema in downtown Berlin that resembled a school classroom more than a movie theater, with rows of foldable chairs and a projector screen. It delved into a more philosophical side of the debate, with its view that it is hypocritical to denounce romantic relationships with animals while largely ignoring the existence of slaughterhouses or fur coats."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/arts/music/new-york-philharmonic-led-by-christoph-von-dohnanyi.html,"What a difference a conductor can make.Last week with the New York Philharmonic, Lorin Maazel, the orchestra’s previous music director, came across as curiously unengaged in works by Tchaikovsky and Shostakovich. Mr. Maazel, 82, is a conductor of comprehensive skills and experience. Yet, except for an outstanding account of Lutoslawski’s “Chain 2: Dialogue for Violin and Orchestra,” with the exciting violinist Jennifer Koh in her Philharmonic debut, the performances were stiff and blank.On Thursday the towering conductor Christoph von Dohnanyi, looking fit and distinguished at 83, led the Philharmonic in a Beethoven program at Avery Fisher Hall. And from the first measures of the first work, the Overture to “The Creatures of Prometheus,” the Philharmonic sounded like a different orchestra. “The Creatures of Prometheus” was a rare venture into ballet for Beethoven. The overture usually seems a spirited, if rather light, work. But here the stately opening chords were played with such body, color and character that you were immediately engaged.The players were palpably involved: even the brief silences between the chords conveyed dramatic tension and a sense that something was up.The overall performance was textured and crisp. During genial passages the playing was breezy and glowing. But Mr. Dohnanyi, without being a bit didactic, brought out harmonic depth and intricate details. Maybe, this performance suggested, there is more to this sprightly overture than we assume.After this warm-up, the eminent pianist Radu Lupu, who recently played a well-received recital at Carnegie Hall, was the soloist for Beethoven’s Piano Concerto No. 1 in C. The work often comes across as Beethoven’s early attempt to extend and, in a way, one-up the heritage of the Mozart piano concerto. And this performance had plenty of Mozartean spirit and grace.But Mr. Lupu and Mr. Dohnanyi brought uncommon richness and depth to their account. During the extended orchestral exposition in the opening Allegro con brio movement, a restrained tempo was set, just held back enough to allow phrases to breathe and the flurries of passagework to have wonderful clarity.Mr. Lupu brought an engaging blend of delicacy and incisiveness to his playing. Beethoven wrote this work partly to demonstrate his own prowess as a pianist. But Mr. Lupu was content to let the virtuosic elements of the piano writing take care of themselves. There was nothing flashy about his performance. He had other things on his mind, namely, revealing to us all the coy charms and inventive touches in the music.He brought out striking inner voices and slinky chromatic bass lines that you seldom notice in other performances. He enlivened the mysteriousness of the slow movement by playing undulant riffs in the accompaniment with hazy sound as the music slipped through unexpected harmonic areas. His rendition of the finale captured not just the impish joy but also the audacious flights in the music.After intermission Mr. Dohnanyi drew a commanding and inexorable account of Beethoven’s Fifth Symphony from the inspired Philharmonic players. In a coincidence of scheduling, on the previous night Daniel Barenboim had conducted the excellent young Israeli, Palestinian and other Arab players of the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra in a Beethoven program at Carnegie Hall that included the Fifth Symphony, the first program in a survey of the complete nine symphonies that runs through Sunday afternoon. This would seem to be Beethoven week in New York."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/sports/football/lineman-steve-wright-was-model-for-walter-payton-award.html,"The N.F.L. will present its Walter Payton Man of the Year award on Saturday, an honor that goes to a player who excels on the field and is known for his charitable activities off it.The winner gets a trophy. But it is not of Payton. Instead, it’s of an obscure 6-foot-6-inch, 250-pound offensive tackle who modeled for it when it was originally sculptured in 1969. His name is Steve Wright.“I’m the poster boy for being in the right place at the right time,” Wright, now 70 and a retired salesman living in Augusta, Ga., said in a phone interview.In college, Wright won a national title with Alabama, and he was a member of the Green Bay Packers teams that won the first two Super Bowls under Vince Lombardi.Wright became a minor celebrity in the mid-1970s when he wrote the irreverent memoir “I’d Rather Be Wright,” chronicling his misadventures on and off the field. In its frank assessment of what it was like to be an uncelebrated player on the Packers, the Giants and a handful of other teams, it was seen by some as football’s answer to Jim Bouton’s “Ball Four.”And then there is the award. Johnny Unitas won the first Man of the Year award in 1970. Payton won the award in 1977, and the N.F.L. named it for him after his death in 1999. But the trophy never changed. The sculpture was created in 1969, by the artist Daniel Bennett Schwartz.Schwartz, 83, said the N.F.L. executive David Boss gave him the commission because he was familiar with a Schwartz painting of Jim Brown that appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated and a series of portraits he did of Baltimore Colts players.In response to Boss’s commission, Schwartz sculptured what he called “The Gladiator,” a lineman standing with a cape draped across his shoulders.“I decided to place it in the era that I grew up in,” Schwartz said.He added: “Nobody expected a cape. Capes had been done away with. To me he looked like a Greek soldier or a gladiator.”The N.F.L. approved the concept but wanted the statue to have a bronze tint and the figure to have a more up-to-date look.The league contacted the Giants to send a model to Schwartz’s studio in Manhattan. Wright, who was in the middle of his two-year stint on the Giants, was chosen, though the reason is lost to time.Wright said the pose he took was inspired by a photograph he remembered of his former Packers teammate Forrest Gregg with his face and helmet covered in mud.In his book, Wright wrote: “The award goes to the ‘outstanding citizen-athlete’ in the league every season. The statue is supposed to represent the ideal football player, a composite of every man who ever played, or will ever play, professional football.“Boy, they sure picked a bummer of a guy to pose for it, didn’t they? The guys who won would turn over in their graves if they knew it was me.”He added: “Johnny Unitas, John Hadl, Willie Lanier. They all won a statue of me.”Wright sees football as merely a game and not a way of life. Although he describes his seasons in the league as “the time of his life,” he is not sentimental about his years in the game. In 2011, he auctioned off his ring from Super Bowl I for $73,000.Wright, especially in his book, has little reverence for the game’s icons, including his coach at Alabama, Bear Bryant.“Bryant’s an impressive person until you know him,” Wright wrote. On a visit to the coach’s house, he noticed, “The whole place was covered with nothing but pictures of him.”He went on: “I was surprised there weren’t just plain wall mirrors instead. It would have saved a lot of trouble.”While there are many targets for Wright’s ire in his book, Lombardi is not one of them.“He was a strict disciplinarian,” Wright wrote, “yet he was able to bend enough because he had an end: he wanted to win football games. It didn’t make any difference to him what you looked like, where you came from or what you did in the off-season, just as long as when you walked on that field with a Packer uniform on, you were the best.”Wright, however, had a knack for angering Lombardi. In his book, he includes a passage Lombardi wrote in Look magazine that recounted how the coach, in a fit of anger, hit Wright repeatedly, flailing away at the lineman with his fists during a practice.“What was I doing?” Lombardi wrote in the piece. “Did I hate him, or even dislike him? No, not for a moment. I’m fond of him. He’s one of the most likable men on our squad. That’s his problem. He has all the size and ability to be a great one, but he loves everybody.”Wright credits the coach’s approach with helping him in his successful career selling veterinary pharmaceuticals and insurance after football.“I still operate on Lombardi time,” he said. “I’m always 10 minutes early, no matter where I go.”Wright carries other legacies from his football career every day. He met Sandy, his wife of 38 years, while he was playing. He walks on two prosthetic knees. He still has his Super Bowl II ring.And, of course, both Wright and Schwartz are connected to the N.F.L. through the Man of the Year statue. Schwartz receives a commission from the league for recasting the statue every year.For Wright, the reminders of his stint as a model are unpredictable. He recalled, for instance, watching an interview with the retired quarterback Kurt Warner on television. The camera was in Warner’s living room, and behind him could be seen the Man of the Year trophy Warner won in 2008.“Hey,” Wright remembered saying to himself, “I know who that is.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/fashion/michael-strahan-is-playing-on-a-new-field.html,"On the Friday before the presidential inauguration, Michael Strahan paid impromptu homage to Michelle Obama’s new bangs during a taping of “Live With Kelly and Michael,” the morning show he co-hosts with Kelly Ripa. Seated next to Ms. Ripa at the desk they share five mornings a week, Mr. Strahan entertained the crowd in the show’s studio by donning a wig, batting his lashes and staring longingly into the camera — a ridiculous gesture for any man, let alone one who stands 6 feet 5 inches, weighs 240 pounds and helped the New York Giants win the Super Bowl in 2008 with his talent for driving quarterbacks into the turf.Not that he has forgone his past life completely. Two days later, Mr. Strahan was on millions of television screens once again, this time in a dapper suit and wide plaid tie, offering as a co-host of “Fox NFL Sunday” a nuanced breakdown of the flaws in the Atlanta Falcons’ defense before the team took on the San Francisco 49ers in the playoffs.“Man, I haven’t really had any free time in, basically, forever,” Mr. Strahan said on a blustery afternoon not long ago. He was exiting the minimalist lobby of his Upper West Side apartment building, hoping to squeeze a quick shopping excursion into a schedule no more forgiving than when he played football. He purchased the apartment, which is a few blocks from the “Live” studio at ABC’s headquarters, last September, after beating out dozens of entertainment veterans (Seth Meyers and Bryant Gumbel among them) to replace Regis Philbin, the show’s host for nearly a quarter of a century.For Mr. Strahan, the job is the apex of what has been one of the more curious and unexpected professional journeys in recent memory. The combination of his two shows, each No. 1 in its time slot, means he is beamed into a larger, more demographically diverse subset of America than even Ryan Seacrest. And when either show is off the air? There’s Mr. Strahan in Subway’s national ads; there he is in the celebrity-spattered campaign for St. Jude’s Children’s Hospital; and there he is lending his support to same-sex marriage. This fall, he was christened by People magazine one of the Sexiest Men Alive; last month he was selected as a finalist for the Pro Football Hall of Fame — conclusive evidence that Mr. Strahan has established himself as the rare media personality as recognizable to housewives as he is to their adolescent sons.“He had a following before,” said Michael Gelman, the longtime producer of “Live.” But with this show, “you have three to four million people watching you five days a week. When you think about it, who else is seen by so many people for so long?”Wearing a puffy black down jacket and crisp bluejeans, Mr. Strahan, 41, ducked into the back seat of a GMC Denali idling out front of his building; his driver, Greg, was at the wheel. “Thing is, I don’t really like free time,” Mr. Strahan said as the vehicle made its way into rush-hour traffic. “People are always warning me that I’m going to burn out” — a justifiable concern given that “Fox NFL Sunday” tapes in Los Angeles, giving Mr. Strahan a single jet-lagged day off each week and meaning his Monday tapings of “Live” are often done “in a delirium” straight off a red-eye.“But the truth is,” he added, “the only thing that tires me out is hearing people tell me that. Opposite shows, opposite coasts, opposite demographics, opposite everything — I love it, man!”Here Mr. Strahan flashed his disarming smile: the ear-to-ear half moon punctuated by a cavernous gap between his front teeth — a physical manifestation of the cuddly, confidently clownish personality that won over the core audience of “Live.”“He was certainly an out-of-the-box choice,” Mr. Gelman said. “Frankly, I wasn’t that aware of him. But whatever we threw at him, he was game, which is rarer than you’d think.”Ms. Ripa agreed with the assessment, pointing to a particular instance during Mr. Strahan’s auditioning phase that convinced her and others he was right for the job. “Channing Tatum was on the show promoting ‘Magic Mike,’ ” she recalled, referring to the hit film about male strippers. “And Michael says something like, ‘You’re not the only Magic Mike on this stage,’ and ripped off these tearaway pants and started dancing. It takes a special person to come up with that and pull it off.”Even athletes fortunate enough to find work in television upon retirement typically have to accept radically diminished prospects. “All the sacrifice, all the pain, it can be like you were renting a life and the rental is up; I didn’t want that, no way,” said Mr. Strahan, who is undoubtedly earning more than the $5 million he made during his 15th and final season with the Giants, in 2007-8. Terry Bradshaw, the Hall of Fame quarterback and one of Mr. Strahan’s co-hosts on “Fox NFL Sunday,” joked last fall that Mr. Strahan was now pulling in $16 million, a not unreasonable estimate given Ms. Ripa’s reported $20 million salary. (Mr. Strahan declined to to divulge his salary. “I’m doing fine,” he said, “but that’s just Terry being a knucklehead. I wouldn’t tell him what I was making because he might ask me for a loan.”)The evening’s shopping expedition turned out to be a good perch from which to witness the diversity of Mr. Strahan’s current fan base, as people ranging from construction workers to 20-something women made a point of saying hello. His first stop was T. Anthony, a luggage and leather goods shop on Park Avenue, where he hoped to find a backgammon board. “Nicole got me into playing,” he said, referring to Nicole Murphy, Mr. Strahan’s fiancée (and Eddie Murphy’s ex), with whom he shares his homes in New York and Bel Air.The instant he stepped out of the car, he was spotted by a young man driving by, who leaned out his window and, with a pump of his fist, shouted: “Yo, Strahan! Love you, man!”Moments later, after picking out a leather-encased backgammon set — and wincing at the $1,500 price tag as he handed over his American Express Black Card — he was back out on the street, where a woman who looked to be in her 40s passed him on the sidewalk.“I watch you every morning,” she told him. “Love you and Kelly!”Today, Mr. Strahan’s admirers also include a number of fellow athletes, who see his trajectory as evidence that sports broadcasting is not their only option upon retiring. “When you’re a 20-something-year-old athlete and you’re getting a six-figure check every week, you’re not thinking about next week,” he said. “You’re not thinking, ‘I’m going to be broke,’ or ‘I’m going to need another job.’ But I’ll tell you, there are a lot of broke athletes out there — I know plenty — and I didn’t want to end up as one.”Mr. Strahan recently started a management company with two partners, focusing in part on helping athletes navigate their post-playing-career pursuits. Among his clients are Deion Sanders, the Hall of Fame cornerback, and Tony Gonzalez, the tight end for the Atlanta Falcons, who said in an interview that he was “95 percent sure” he played his final game two weeks ago, when his team lost to San Francisco in the playoff game that Mr. Strahan, of course, was discussing.“I had other people representing me, but after seeing what Michael’s been able to do, I switched,” Mr. Gonzalez said. “I mean, replacing Regis? Are you kidding me? Michael’s become the model of what’s possible for a lot of us who aren’t going to be playing much longer. Tiki tried it, you know, but he couldn’t get it done.”Mr. Gonzalez was referring to Tiki Barber, once the running back for the Giants and Mr. Strahan’s former teammate, who caused a stir when he left the sport in his prime after the 2006 season to pursue a career in broadcasting. Poised and handsome, Mr. Barber appeared to be an executive producer’s dream: a star in one world who would effortlessly make the transition into another. He was awarded as such, securing a coveted contract with NBC to work as a correspondent on both “Sunday Night Football” and the “Today” show.Mr. Barber’s success, however, was fleeting. For starters, his natural charisma turned out to be less infectious once he was off the field permanently. On “Sunday Night Football,” he was demoted from the studio to the sidelines, and on “Today” he struggled for airtime and reportedly clashed with his fellow correspondents. Then it was revealed that Mr. Barber was having an affair with a “Today” intern while his wife was pregnant, a public scandal that no doubt contributed to NBC’s decision not to renew his contracts. Over the past three years, Mr. Barber has all but disappeared from public view.“Yeah, yeah, people say to me all the time, ‘You have the career Tiki thought he was going to have,’ ” Mr. Strahan said. (When he was named Mr. Philbin’s replacement, New York magazine’s culture blog reported it with one sentence: “Somewhere, Tiki Barber is weeping.”) “Thing about Tiki, he said what he wanted and, in a sense, he got it. What he wanted all along was more on the news side, kind of like Matt Lauer. He’s more intense than I am, more methodical. To be that locked in, it would drive me nuts.”But like Mr. Barber, Mr. Strahan is no stranger to having unsavory rumors about his personal life play out on the front pages of newspapers. In 2006, he filed for divorce from his wife, Jean, after seven years of marriage, a split that rapidly turned ugly, with Mr. Strahan accused in court of adultery and, in a particularly tabloid-worthy moment, of secretly videotaping his sister-in-law undressing. It was not exactly the sort of behavior, in short, that would endear a man to a daytime television audience. Though all of the charges against him were dismissed, Mr. Strahan was ordered to pay his former wife $15.3 million and child support for their twin daughters — a significant sum for someone who at the time was worth $22 million. (He has two more children, a boy and a girl, with his first wife.)Though Mr. Strahan knew he was a few years from retirement, he said he didn’t have time to worry that the scandal could derail a potential television career. “That was the last thing I was thinking about at the time,” he said, as his car made its way down to the meatpacking district. “I had my girls, my twins, and I was only worried about not saying something that one day they’d see in a newspaper and say, ‘Daddy, why did you say this about Mommy?’ ”Unlike Mr. Barber, Mr. Strahan benefited from the fact that he was still playing football at the time of his divorce. By the time he won the Super Bowl, he had been rechristened a local hero. And if his appearances on “Live” served as the final step in pushing the details of his divorce into the recesses of the public imagination, Mr. Strahan believes that this period in his life ultimately helped him prepare for the show.“It was horrible, of course, but at the same time it was one of the best things to ever happen to me,” he said. “You have all these things being said about you, things that aren’t true, but you can’t control any of it. At first I was freaking out, but then I just realized: the only thing I can be is me. I used to be really worried what people thought, and I always tried to act in ways to make sure I was liked. And you know what? Suddenly none of that mattered. So I just started being myself, and I got really comfortable with that, and I think that’s what people like about seeing me on the show.”He was in the meatpacking district now, a neighborhood where he lived for a stint during his playing days. He stopped into the Jean Shop, a bespoke denim store, to purchase a few pairs of jeans and say hello to the owner — one of many old friends he has collected over the years. Before leaving, the two did a shot of tequila.If Mr. Strahan’s anything-goes personality is largely responsible for his success, it also belies a focused ambition. After all, the first time Mr. Strahan was ever on “Live,” a few days after the Giants won the Super Bowl in 2008, Mr. Philbin asked about Mr. Strahan’s plans after football. Their exchange has become something of a legend among the staff:Mr. Strahan: “Well, there’s a show that I’m on right now that, you know, maybe you want to. ...”Mr. Philbin: “Are you saying?”Mr. Strahan: “Live with Michael and Kelly!”“I wasn’t serious at all,” Mr. Strahan said, back in his car and heading home. “It was just a joke, but it makes me think that maybe if you speak something, it comes true.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/arts/music/jim-jamess-muses-gil-scott-heron-lula-collins-roy-ayers.html,"THE MUSICIAN JIM JAMES lives in Louisville, Ky., a city that he says defies expectations.“All the Southerners think we’re Yanks, and all the Yanks think we’re Southerners, and all the Midwesterners think we’re east,” he said. “Everybody’s always wrong about Louisville. That’s kind of why I love it so much.”Mr. James, 34, the frontman and songwriter for the rock band My Morning Jacket, and a frequent collaborator with other indie artists, defies expectations himself: an arena rocker who got there without radio play, a rootsy Bonnaroo festival mainstay who is comfortable shredding. His debut solo album of original material, “Regions of Light and Sound of God,” out Tuesday from ATO Records, takes inspiration from “Gods’ Man,” a 1929 graphic novel (one of the earliest published in the United States, it used woodcuts) that he hopes to adapt into a film. “We’re moving down the pipeline, we got a screenplay, and we’re looking for a studio,” he said. “The novel, when I saw it, it was a real, real strong déjà vu. I got obsessed with it and started writing music to it.”When he’s in his home studio he avoids other artists’ music. “When people are recording and they’re like, ‘I want to get the drum sound of the Beatles,’ I hate that.” But otherwise he’s into things on repeat. Lately that has meant vintage gospel. “The gospel funk soul era, that’s what I’m obsessed with — pretty much all the ’70s through early ’80s,” he said. “For me it’s more powerful to hear people sing about God than love in most circumstances, because I’ve been hearing people sing about love for most of my life. I don’t really believe in a God, like a white man with a beard in the sky. But most of the music that I enjoy, they do it with such passion, I know it doesn’t really matter what they’re calling God, because we’re talking about the same thing.”He spoke by phone with Melena Ryzik recently about ruthless tunes, transcendence, meditation and getting fired. These are excerpts from the conversation.Q. Have you worked on movies before?A. My relationship with Hollywood has been incredibly frustrating. I’ve gotten lots of offers to do things, and I’ve scored a couple films, but I’ve been fired from everything I’ve tried to do, for being too weird. One was for “The Beaver.” Brian Reitzell — he’s done Sofia Coppola’s films, and he did “Friday Night Lights” — we got paired up because [the “Beaver” director] Jodie Foster for some reason wanted me to do it, and she wanted Brian. We were making “The Beaver” super [strange]. I think it was one of those cases where they wanted to edit the film into something more obvious, where they needed music to make the viewer feel sad or make the viewer feel happy. That film we got fired from. Then we regrouped to do this film called “Goats,” and it was the exact same story.I’m waiting every day to get the call [for “Gods’ Man”], once we find the studio: “Well, Jim, we like your music, but we’ve decided it just doesn’t fit. We’ve decided to go with a more Mumford & Sons kind of sound. That’s what’s popular now.”Meanwhile you’re listening to music that’s about doubt and spirituality, like Lula Collins’s “Help Me.”It’s so ruthless, it almost reminds me of N.W.A. The rhythm of it, it’s almost like “Straight Out of Compton.” But it’s positive, just the way the groove is, her voice. I love N.W.A. It’s real. This is a different version of that. You get the positive mentality of “Please, Lord, help me,” instead of taking that feeling out in violence. I feel like more people need to hear that because you can take everything out in a positive way. I’m tired of really violent music.Is there anything that you just jam out to?“Under the Hammer.” Gil Scott-Heron is one of my biggest heroes and inspirations. He taught me a new way to be ruthless. The way the song is produced, I’ve never heard anything like it. It’s a really crazy combo of funk and rock, but it sounds like it’s out of a freezer or something. The guitar sounds like it’s covered in ice cubes.He’s influenced nearly everyone, like Roy Ayers, the jazz composer and vibraphonist, also one of the most sampled musicians. Have you sampled him?No, but I got into Roy Ayers because of that. This song “Searching,” I feel like I’m always searching. That’s my role in life. This song is constantly a soundtrack. It’s super emotional, but it has a beautiful motion to it. It makes you want to move, instead of lying in your room and crying.Do you look to music for those moments of transcendence?I want my music to feel like it’s useful. I’m not an unhappy person, because I have a lot of fun, but I’m definitely not a peaceful person, and I feel like that’s what I’m looking for. Or music that’s bizarre that I don’t understand, like that Floating Action song [“Alpine Shadow”]. I don’t know what he’s singing about. When I hear the song, I feel like I see snow. I’m sitting in the Alps with, like, two snow leopards, and I’m resistant to the cold. He sings, “the calm and peace you bring me.” I feel like it’s one of the most beautiful lines I’ve ever heard. I feel like these bands are singing about things that people need to hear. They’re singing about things that people need, like calm and peace.You own this CD set “The Inner Art of Meditation,” by Jack Kornfield. Do you get the same thing from meditation and music?For me it’s about how do I get lost, in a good way, over and over again. Meditation is about that. It’s about disappearing into that space where you’re alive but you’re alive like a tree’s alive or a butterfly’s alive. It’s the same way when you’re playing music or writing. A lot of people think it sounds hippie-dippy, but you’re deeply lost in playing a song, you’re thinking about a song. You’re not thinking about your job or your taxes. For me I feel like that is God, it is the essence of everything. If everyone took the time to reach that place, it would really change the world."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/arts/music/wayne-shorters-new-album-is-without-a-net.html,"THE STANDARD LINE on Wayne Shorter is that he’s the greatest living composer in jazz, and one of its greatest saxophonists. He would like you to forget all of that. Not the music, or his relationship to it, but rather the whole notion of pre-eminence, with its granite countenance and fixed coordinates. “We have to beware the trapdoors of the self,” he said recently.“You think you’re the only one that has a mission,” he went on, “and your mission is so unique, and you expound this missionary process over and over again with something you call a vocabulary, which in itself becomes old and decrepit.” He laughed sharply.Mr. Shorter will turn 80 this year. Decrepitude hasn’t had a chance to catch up to him. Last week he appeared at Carnegie Hall as a featured guest with the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, which played several of his compositions. On Tuesday “Without a Net,” easily the year’s most anticipated jazz album, will become his first release on Blue Note in more than four decades. And next Saturday he’ll be at the Walt Disney Concert Hall with the Los Angeles Philharmonic for the premiere of “Gaia,” which he wrote as a showcase for the bassist and singer Esperanza Spalding.He hasn’t accrued this late-inning momentum alone. The vehicle for most of Mr. Shorter’s recent activity, including the orchestral work, is his superlative quartet with Danilo Pérez on piano, John Patitucci on bass and Brian Blade on drums. A band of spellbinding intuition, with an absolute commitment to the spirit of discovery, it has had an incalculable influence on the practice of jazz in the 21st century — and not necessarily for the same reasons that established Mr. Shorter’s legend in the 20th.Since the emergence of the quartet, which released its first album on Verve in 2002, jazz’s aesthetic center has moved perceptibly: away from the hotshot soloist and toward a more collectivist, band-driven ideal. There has also been an unusual amount of dialogue between jazz’s tradition-minded base camp and its expeditionary outposts, where conventions exist to be challenged.Mr. Shorter’s working band is far from the only one to embody these principles during the past decade, but it has been the most acclaimed and widely heard. Traces of its style can be detected in other groups, including those led by the saxophonist Chris Potter and the trumpeter Ambrose Akinmusire. Its slippery methodology has also taken root in the conservatory, and not just at the Berklee College of Music, where Mr. Pérez is on the faculty, or at the Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, where Mr. Shorter is a resident guru.“The students are very familiar with that quartet,” said Doug Weiss, who teaches a popular Wayne Shorter ensemble class at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music. “They come in having heard the way that band plays together, and a lot of them have no idea what’s going on, and that’s why they’re there.”So in addition to Mr. Shorter’s body of work — his terse and insinuative compositions, which have been closely studied by jazz musicians for decades — this newer generation has also had the opportunity to grapple with his elusive philosophy of play.Once, in an interview, Mr. Shorter was asked to account for his pursuit of music above other art forms. He replied that music has an inherent sense of velocity and mystery. It would be hard to find a more concise distillation of his priorities as a bandleader.“When we go out onstage we always start from nothing,” said Mr. Patitucci by phone from Mr. Pérez’s native Panama, where the quartet headlined a jazz festival last month. “So anybody can spin the wheels in a certain direction, and then we develop those themes.”What follows isn’t free jazz, exactly, though it uses some of the same tools. “It’s spontaneous composition,” Mr. Patitucci said, “with counterpoint and harmony and lyricism. All of those values are still there. It’s just being pressurized into milliseconds.”Mr. Shorter framed the idea as an image: “We don’t count how much water there is in a wave when we see the ocean.” He was on the couch of a hotel suite overlooking Central Park South, during one of his recent visits from Los Angeles, where he lives. That evening he would perform at a gala for the David Lynch Foundation, along with the pianist Herbie Hancock, his former partner in the Miles Davis Quintet. He wore dress loafers and a fleece pullover embroidered with the logo of Soka Gakkai International, the Nichiren Buddhist organization to which he and Mr. Hancock belong.A scheduled interview began with an unscheduled interruption: Ms. Spalding — who won the Grammy for best new artist in 2011, and was also booked at the gala — dropped by with the Argentine pianist Leo Genovese. For all of her success Ms. Spalding still belongs to the demographic that grew up with the notion of Wayne as sage: she and Mr. Genovese were there simply to give him a hug.Mr. Shorter is a notoriously elliptical conversationalist, prone to cosmic digression and quick-fire allusion. During a spirited two-hour interview he touched on modern art, social politics and science fiction — among the books he produced for inspection was the dystopian “Ready Player One” by Ernest Cline — as well as music and movies, and movie music. “I’m looking at a lot of old silent films now,” he said, “and I listen to the new, hip boy bands. I was checking out some Selena Gomez.” On the subject of jazz, he said pithily, “The word ‘jazz’ to me only means ‘I dare you.’ ”But he also painted his own jazz narrative in precise strokes, whether it was hearing Charlie Parker at Birdland at the age of 18 — what stuck with him was a quotation of “Petrushka,” the Stravinsky ballet, that Parker sneaked into one solo — or sensing the mortal urgency that burned in John Coltrane, his fellow saxophonist, and in some ways a mentor. And Mr. Shorter made several references to the cryptic wisdom of Miles Davis, slipping each time into an unusually convincing imitation of that trumpeter’s throaty rasp.Davis’s celebrated quintet of the mid-’60s was one of the most aerodynamically advanced in the history of jazz, and apart from Davis himself Mr. Shorter was its chief in-house designer. One of his signature contributions was “Nefertiti,” a slithery 16-bar tune ambiguously shaded with altered and half-diminished chords.On record, as the title track to a 1968 album, the song features Davis and Mr. Shorter tracing and retracing its melody while the rhythm section improvises in the background, with all the supple intrigue of a shadow creeping across the landscape. It’s a useful precedent for Mr. Shorter’s current band, which derives much of its dynamism from rhythm-section cohesion within the loosest possible framework.Another precedent, less obvious, is the transitional band that Davis led before his swerve into jazz-funk, a quintet with Mr. Shorter, the pianist Chick Corea, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette. A boxed set released last week on Columbia/Legacy, “Live in Europe 1969: The Bootleg Series Vol. 2,” illuminates just how much liberty that group took with its materials, even to the point of feverish abstraction. It never sounds freer than on a concert in Stockholm, attacking three of Mr. Shorter’s compositions: “Paraphernalia,” “Nefertiti” and “Masqualero.”Two of those have surfaced on Mr. Shorter’s recent albums with the quartet, along with other pieces from a broad swath of his career. “Without a Net,” a compilation of live recordings from 2011, opens with “Orbits,” a theme from the Davis quintet era. It also includes a majestic take on “Plaza Real,” from the songbook of Weather Report, the epochal ’70s fusion band that Mr. Shorter led with Joe Zawinul.But the provenance of the music takes a back seat to its process, which Mr. Shorter said was meant to herald an ideal of self-actualized communal leadership. “This kind of stuff I’m talking about is a challenge to play onstage,” he allowed, and chuckled. “When Miles would hear someone talking about something philosophical, he would say” — here came the rasp — “ ‘Well, why don’t you go out there and play that?’ One thing we talk about is that to ‘play that’ we have to maybe play music that doesn’t sound like music.”If that sounds like a Zen riddle, comfort yourself with the knowledge that even Mr. Shorter’s band mates have had to warm to the uncertainty. “It was scary, to be honest,” Mr. Pérez said of his early experience in the quartet. “It was a shock to put myself into a situation where I had no idea what was happening. Even when I listened back, I felt like an outsider: ‘What is that? What key are we in?’ ” He gradually made adjustments, including one to his practice regimen: for two or three hours at a stretch he would watch Tom and Jerry cartoons with the sound muted, making up a score.The band hasn’t relaxed its pursuit of revelation, which expresses itself in myriad ways: Mr. Pérez’s on-the-fly cadenzas, the unexpected thunderclap of Mr. Blade’s crash cymbal, the dartlike insistence of Mr. Shorter’s improvisational flights. All this remains true even as Mr. Shorter steps up his output as a composer. “He’ll bring in this 10-page piece of music, and it’s gorgeous,” Mr. Patitucci said. “And he’ll say, ‘Just this 16 bars.’ He’s not even attached to what he wrote.”The center of gravity on “Without a Net” is “Pegasus,” designed to feature Imani Winds, a classical wind ensemble. Through much of that track’s 23 minutes, the woodwinds deftly frame the dramatic fluctuations of Mr. Shorter’s band; at times the two factions achieve a compelling synthesis, advancing a dramatic theme.It’s horizon-scanning music, but it also features glimpses of the past, like the fanfare from “Witch Hunt,” which led off Mr. Shorter’s landmark 1965 Blue Note album “Speak No Evil.” During his solo in “Pegasus” Mr. Shorter also nods to the old Sonny Rollins tune “Oleo.” Elsewhere on the new album he drops a quotation of the Afro-Cuban bebop standard “Manteca,” and leads the band through a cubist recasting of “Flying Down to Rio,” a movie theme originally sung by Fred Astaire.“To me there’s no such thing as beginning or end,” Mr. Shorter said. “I always say don’t discard the past completely because you have to bring with you the most valuable elements of experience, to be sort of like a flashlight. A flashlight into the unknown.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/movies/tribute-to-amos-vogel-at-anthology-film-archives.html,"Part movie guide, part manifesto, Amos Vogel’s 1974 book “Film as a Subversive Art” has loomed large in many a film buff’s coming of age. A mind-expanding compendium of cinematic radicalism — from silent-era comedy to antiwar agitprop, avant-garde experiments to hard-core provocations — it is an idiosyncratic bid to create an anticanonical canon. The book has introduced generations of cinephiles to a wide array of seditious and often challenging work, but at its core is a simple, even utopian premise: Subversive cinema shows its viewers new worlds and new ways of seeing the world.Vogel, who died in April at 91, was one of the most beloved and influential figures in American film culture, a founder of the fabled film society Cinema 16 and the New York Film Festival. At Cinema 16, which he ran with his wife, Marcia, from 1947 to 1963, Vogel assembled programs that combined daring auteur cinema with newsreels, ethnographic documentaries, experimental shorts, science and nature films and more — a hodgepodge approach that reflected his catholic tastes and his belief in the power of unexpected connections.“Film as a Subversive Art” shares this energy and eclecticism. It encompasses revolutionary form and content: hundreds of titles from various genres and periods, grouped under loose themes (surrealism, minimalism, nudity, blasphemy) and accompanied by a generous selection of often graphic film stills. (This “pictorial enlightenment,” as Luis Buñuel termed it in a jacket blurb, makes the book eminently browsable — and somewhat awkward subway reading.)A Viennese Jew whose family emigrated to the United States after the Nazis annexed Austria — he was 17 at the time — Vogel was a lifelong leftist, and in all his endeavors politics was never far from the surface. “Art can never take the place of social action,” he wrote in “Film as a Subversive Art,” “but its task remains forever the same: to change consciousness.” In the final paragraph he revealed what he took to be the book’s true subject: “human freedom.”Anthology Film Archives is paying homage to Vogel with a series, starting Wednesday, of more than two dozen works discussed in his book. The opening film, “W.R.: Mysteries of the Organism” (1971) — directed by Dusan Makavejev, a central figure in the movement called the Yugoslav Black Wave — is a racy crazy quilt of fact and fiction inspired by the controversial psychoanalyst and sex theorist Wilhelm Reich. A film that connects sexual freedom and political liberation, it holds pride of place in Vogel’s taxonomy of transgression. (An image from it emblazons the book’s cover.)At Vogel’s memorial last summer the film shown at his request was “The Bed,” an ode to free love by James Broughton, in which a bed rolls down a hill and settles in an idyllic meadow, where it accommodates many different configurations of trysting partners. (“The Bed” will be screened in the Museum of the Moving Image’s Vogel tribute next month.)Some of the films in the Anthology series are still fairly well known, among them Richard Lester’s pop-art Beatles comedy, “A Hard Day’s Night” (1964); Bernardo Bertolucci’s rites-of-passage drama “Before the Revolution” (1964); and “Marjoe,” an Oscar-winning 1972 vérité documentary about a sham evangelist. But the program favors — to borrow a Cinema 16 slogan — “films you can’t see elsewhere.”Among the rarities are Jean-Daniel Pollet’s trancelike counterculture nightmare “Le Sang” (1971), about hippie-ish nomads wandering a post-apocalyptic landscape, and Arthur Ginsberg’s “Continuing Story of Carel and Ferd” (1972), a protoreality TV experiment in which a video camera moves in with a couple (he’s an addict, she’s a porn actress) to document the effects of “living too close to an electronic medium.”Partial to the new waves emerging from cold-war-era Eastern Europe, where artists working under totalitarianism had been “forced into allegory,” as he put it, Vogel looked far afield and deep into film history for signs of radicalism. The Anthology series ranges from the expressionist silent era (Marcel L’Herbier’s 1924 adaptation of Pirandello’s “Late Mattia Pascal”) to post-colonial Africa (Ousmane Sembene’s “Emitai,” once banned in France for depicting the French Army’s massacre of a Senegalese village) to the vibrant Japanese underground of the early ’70s (Shuji Terayama’s “Emperor Tomato Ketchup,” still shocking for breaching the taboo of childhood sexuality).Vogel’s taste for confrontational fare went hand in hand with his approachability. His mission, simply put, was to expose the widest possible audience to potentially eye-opening movies, and his good-humored, avuncular manner was evident both on the page and in person. He can be seen in an affectionate 2004 documentary by Paul Cronin, also screening in the series, speaking candidly about his life and his programming philosophy. (Tacked to the wall of his home office is a quotation from the German writer Günther Eich: “Be sand, not oil, in the machinery of the world.”)Anthology is also showing a 1980 episode of “Reel Philadelphia,” a public-television program that Vogel hosted. Introducing a raucous punk-scene documentary, he delivers a station-mandated viewer advisory while impishly decrying the warning as misguided. He concludes: “To prevent all of you from seeing the film because it may be off-putting to some of you would be the worst possible solution.”From today’s vantage point some of the most fascinating films in the series double as time capsules, like “Troublemakers” (1966), which chronicles the failed efforts of white militant activists working as community organizers in a black section of Newark, and the pioneering feminist Kate Millett’s talking-head documentary “Three Lives” (1971).Vogel’s book is a product of its newly liberated times, signaling gains in civil rights and the relaxing of censorship. But it is also a project that, by definition, demands continuation. “It is in the nature of subversion that its perpetrators should be subverted in turn,” he wrote. Idealistic and humble enough to call a book that represented the culmination of his life’s work “a rough draft,” Vogel, it’s safe to assume, would want “Film as a Subversive Art” remembered not just as an alternate history of cinema but also, and more important, as an expression of faith in its future."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/fashion/former-nfl-players-move-into-show-business.html,"Michael Strahan, with his weekly gig on “Fox NFL Sunday,” is one of dozens of football players who have found a welcoming home on sports programming — either as commentators or game analysts — once their gridiron careers have come to an end. These days, stars like Dan Marino, Phil Simms and Boomer Esiason, and even journeymen like Tim Hasselbeck and Rich Gannon, can be found on the air talking about the sport they once played. (Though perhaps none made the transition from player to commentator more memorably, or did it better, than Frank Gifford and “Dandy” Don Meredith when they were on “Monday Night Football” in the 1970s and ‘80s.)But the list of former players who, like Mr. Strahan, have branched out into show business — and did so successfully — is not quite as long. Here are a few of the more notable examples.Jim Brown One of the few players to retire at the height of his career, the Hall of Fame running back walked away from football in 1966 at age 29 to focus on a film career. Mr. Brown found some success as an actor, delivering well-received performances in such films as “The Dirty Dozen,” “Ice Station Zebra” and “100 Rifles” (including an interracial romance scene, then controversial, with Raquel Welch), before moving on to a series of blaxploitation films in the 1970s. He also appeared nude in Playgirl in 1974.Joe Namath After winning the Super Bowl with the New York Jets in 1969, Broadway Joe was an instant celebrity, something he tried to cash in on even before his playing days were over, most notably by taking a starring role opposite Ann-Margret in “C. C. and Company.” (“A truly awful biker film,” one critic said.) Other films like “Norwood” and “The Last Rebel” also failed to establish him as a credible actor. But Namath seemed undeterred by the lack of praise from either critics or audiences, dabbling in dinner theater around the country and even appearing as Joe Hardy in a production of “Damn Yankees” at the Jones Beach Theater on Long Island in 1981.Terry Bradshaw The winner of four Super Bowls — still a record for an N.F.L. quarterback — the former Pittsburgh Steeler went on to have a respectable acting career in the 1970s and ‘80s, taking supporting roles in the Burt Reynolds films “Hooper,” “Cannonball Run” and “Smokey and the Bandit II.” More recently, he starred with Kathy Bates as Matthew McConaughey’s parents in “Failure to Launch,” a film that contained a memorable — if “eye-searing” counts as memorable — nude scene by the aging Mr. Bradshaw. He is also a co-host of “Fox NFL Sunday” with Mr. Strahan.Alex Karras The former All-Pro defensive lineman for the Detroit Lions from 1958-70 might have been one of the few players who actually found greater fame after his playing days were over. Mr. Karras, who died last year at age 77, made his movie debut in 1968, playing himself in the film version of the George Plimpton book “Paper Lion.” Other film credits included “Porky’s,” “Against All Odds” and “Victor/Victoria.” But he is probably best known for his starring role on the sitcom “Webster” from 1983 to 1989, in which he played a retired football player who takes in a black boy (Emmanuel Lewis), the orphaned young son of a former teammate.Merlin Olsen The star former Los Angeles Rams defensive tackle from 1962-76 was another player who found post-football fame on the small screen, most notably on the Michael Landon series “Little House on the Prairie,” playing the bearded lumberman Jonathan Garvey for several seasons. He followed up that with a starring role in his own series, “Father Murphy,” which ran on NBC from 1981 to 1983. Mr. Olsen died in 2010 at the age of 69."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/arts/music/a-late-quartet-and-quartet-with-music-making-on-film.html,"THAT A STRING QUARTET has one cello and one viola but two violins complicates things. What makes a particular performer more suited to the first violin part? Or the second? Must a first violinist, of necessity, be the more assertive and flashy player?These questions may seem little more than insider quibbling. Yet Yaron Zilberman’s recent film “A Late Quartet” — about multiple crises among members of an esteemed Manhattan-based string quartet as it embarks on its 25th-anniversary season — makes this rarefied subject central to the drama. At least that’s true until the movie, which boasts a powerhouse cast, takes a melodramatic turn toward simmering resentments and an inappropriate affair.As it happens, a poignant aspect of opera is the focus of another film now in limited release, “Quartet,” directed by the actor Dustin Hoffman. With a screenplay by Ronald Harwood, who adapted his own play of the same name, “Quartet” tells of three singers who live in a bucolic English town in what seems, given their modest means, an implausibly elegant retirement home called Beecham House. As they prepare for an annual benefit concert on Verdi’s birthday, the famous diva Jean Horton (the indomitable Maggie Smith), arrives. Despite her glorious career Jean appears to have no choice but to live at Beecham House, and she is miserable about it. Further, she had been briefly married to one of the resident singers, Reginald Paget (Tom Courtenay), who still seethes over their breakup.The story centers on the efforts of Reginald, Cissy Robson (Pauline Collins) and Wilf Bond (Billy Connolly) to talk Jean into singing with them at the benefit. They want to recreate their rendition of the grand quartet from Act III of Verdi’s “Rigoletto,” an opera the four had performed and recorded to acclaim in the old days.“Quartet” is a beautifully acted, lightly comic and pretty slender film. Still, its contrived plot touches on a real concern: the limited longevity of opera singers. With good health, conductors, pianists and other instrumentalists can perform well into their late years. Alas, singers’ voices age right along with their bodies.“A Late Quartet” delves into complex issues of musical performance. The cellist of the fictional Fugue Quartet, Peter Mitchell (played with affecting fragility by Christopher Walken), is a good generation older than the other three members: Daniel Lerner, the ensemble’s charismatic first violinist (played by Mark Ivanir); Robert Gelbart, its valued second violinist (Philip Seymour Hoffman); and Robert’s wife, Juliette Gelbart, the violist (Catherine Keener). Peter was a revered mentor to the others and remains the quartet’s patriarch.But Peter learns he has Parkinson’s disease. His stunned colleagues encourage him to continue performing, at least through the 25th-anniversary season. Still, an ensemble that has thrived largely because of its cohesion must now find a new cellist.Most string quartets go through at least one or two changes in membership over time, though there have been notable exceptions: The great players of the Amadeus String Quartet had nearly 40 years together until the violist Peter Schidlof died in 1987. Sometimes a new member can provide the creative jolt a quartet needs. But no one can know for sure.In “A Late Quartet” (scheduled for DVD release on Tuesday by 20th Century Fox), the musicians are rehearsing their signature piece: Beethoven’s Quartet in C sharp minor (Op. 131), a mystical late work in seven movements played without break, beginning with a slow, somberly beautiful fugue. In these scenes the film realistically depicts the kinds of ego clashes and pent-up frustrations that can break out in even the most committed ensembles. The cellist’s illness emboldens Mr. Hoffman’s Robert to propose another upheaval. He has been feeling restless and taken for granted, not just as the second violinist but also in his marriage, so he announces that he wants to alternate in the first violin parts. Even his wife thinks him rash.Today many quartets, especially younger ones, alternate first and second violinists. Yet not that long ago this practice was rare. The Emerson String Quartet, founded in 1976, was one of the first prominent ensembles to alternate. At the time the decision “raised eyebrows,” as the violinist Eugene Drucker, a founding member (along with the violinist Philip Setzer), said during a recent telephone interview while on tour with the quartet in Austria.“For us it was natural,” Mr. Drucker said, “because we started as a student quartet at Juilliard and had turnover for a while with viola and cello.” (Lawrence Dutton became the violist in 1977, David Finckel the cellist in 1979.) So alternating at those instruments initially offered educational value, giving Mr. Drucker and Mr. Setzer insight into their art form. It felt right, so they kept it up.What are the differences between first and second violin?“Since the first violin is more exposed in most pieces, the first violinist will set the tone in a certain way — if not in the preparation, at least in the way it’s presented,” Mr. Drucker said, cautioning that he was generalizing. “Therefore you have to have a somewhat extroverted personality and the kind of sound needed to grab the audience’s attention and imagination.“The second violin role is not at all the cliché of second fiddle. There are specific skills needed to project your part, often in a lower register that might compete with the viola, which has a very distinctive timbre.”It turns out the Emerson String Quartet is also about to change cellists. Mr. Finckel will depart in May, and he’ll be replaced by Paul Watkins, a Welshman who is also a conductor. But Mr. Finckel, who is a co-director of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center with his wife, the pianist Wu Han, told his Emerson colleagues of his plans to refocus his career in August 2011, giving them time to adjust.While real musicians have their own challenges, actors playing musicians have theirs: faking the playing of an instrument is always awkward. The cast of “A Late Quartet” clearly trained hard with coaches, and the result is passable enough. But it is strange to see such superb actors looking distracted when they mimic the mechanics of playing instruments.The excellent Brentano String Quartet performs Beethoven’s Opus 131 on the soundtrack. In a nice touch, when the characters start looking for a new cellist, they settle on a member of a fictional trio, Nina Lee, the Brentano’s brilliant cellist, who plays herself in a short but crucial scene at the end. (She’s identified in the film as the cellist of a fictional trio.)During an important concert Mr. Walken’s character becomes too impaired to finish a piece. The performance stops. Peter stands up, makes a farewell speech to the audience and calls on Ms. Lee, who happens to be backstage, all set to go. In this brief performance scene Ms. Lee, who knows her way around her instrument, comes across for a moment as the strongest actor of all.In a recent telephone interview Ms. Lee said she was awed to see how intensely these actors were involved in their craft. “We filmed that scene from 10:30 in the evening until about 2 a.m.,” she said. “There would be a break, and the actors would collapse in their seats. Makeup people would come. The director would shout. It was amazing.”Not a typical workday for a cellist in a string quartet.In “Quartet,” by contrast, most of the performing is not supposed to be by artists in their prime; it’s more in the nature of old folks staying active.Hoping to persuade Jean to sing the “Rigoletto” quartet with them, for old time’s sake and to stoke sales for the benefit, the three of them take her to dinner, where they drop the idea. Ms. Smith’s Jean reacts with white-hot outrage. She storms out and appears at breakfast the next morning to curse her former husband and his insensitive cronies.Her indignation seems a false step. All opera singers understand (unless they are Plácido Domingo) that the time will come to stop performing. Some, understandably, stop cold. When Beverly Sills retired from singing at 51, she really stopped and seemed content. Others take a more lighthearted approach. Marilyn Horne, 79, will sing a song now and then alongside young, aspiring singers at a gala concert.That Ms. Smith’s character reacts with such vehement fury makes this diva seem unhinged. Then, suddenly, she reconciles with Reginald and decides to sing the quartet after all, though the film provides no explanation for her turnaround.Still, it is fun to watch these veteran actors throwing themselves into a film about opera. And, wisely Mr. Hoffman never lets us hear Ms. Smith and her colleagues sing. Just as they step onstage to perform the quartet at the benefit, greeted by lusty bravos, the film ends. As the credits roll we hear a fine recording of the Verdi. Cheating, perhaps, but a graceful way out."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/arts/television/stupid-german-tricks-wearing-thin-on-tv.html,"OFFENBURG, GERMANY — The black telescoping arm of the Supertechno 30 camera crane swooped over the live television audience, as the scent of pyrotechnics from a Swedish band’s performance lingered in the air. The Academy Award-winning actor Denzel Washington watched as a German man wearing goggles stuck his finger in a bottle and made a popping sound.Mr. Washington clapped and offered encouragement as though he was back on the sidelines in “Remember the Titans.” He was urging on a young Bavarian, Bernhard Siegel, who was trying to guess from the plunking sound alone how much water was in a series of bottles, for glory, fleeting fame and the chance to win a brand-new car.It was a recent Saturday night, and Mr. Washington, there to promote the film “Flight,” had entered the very German universe of “Wetten, Dass ...?,” a variety show with some 10 million viewers often referred to as the biggest television program in Europe. In more than three decades it has anchored itself in the German consciousness even as viewership has declined and criticism has risen, not just about the show but also about what it represents.Something of an amalgam of “The Tonight Show,” “Saturday Night Live” and “Battle of the Network Stars,” “Wetten, Dass ...?” — which loosely translates as “Want to bet that ...?” — began in February 1981, and the format, in which everyday people compete to execute strange “bets,” or feats, has changed little. Those wacky challenges, what David Letterman might call “Stupid Human Tricks,” remain the heart of a show that is a beloved but perpetually struggling German institution.“Some people say that if anything could survive a nuclear strike, it would be cockroaches and ‘Wetten, Dass ...?,’ ” said its host, Markus Lanz, in an interview after the show wrapped. That survival has frequently been called into question recently. A handsome 43-year-old talk-show host, Mr. Lanz took over the show at a moment of crisis.“Wetten, Dass ...?” narrowly avoided cancellation after a tragic incident played out live. In December 2010 Samuel Koch, a young man on spring-loaded stilts, fell while jumping over an Audi driven by his father and was paralyzed from the neck down in front of millions of viewers.The show’s longtime and popular host, Thomas Gottschalk, quickly announced that the night’s program would be suspended. During the next show he said that he would resign. Many thought the combination of the accident and his departure would spell the end of “Wetten, Dass ...?”Complicating matters further, the leading German newsmagazine, Der Spiegel, reported last month that Mr. Gottschalk’s brother may have had questionable business dealings with several companies whose products appeared on the show. That could amount to inappropriate advertising on state television. One of those products was Audi, whose cars were used as prizes and in the catastrophic gambit that paralyzed the young man.“Wetten, Dass ...?” is not produced by a private television network but by ZDF, one of the two main public stations, similar to the BBC in Britain. In 2011, the most recent year for which figures are available, German public television and radio received over $10 billion in licensing fees from viewers and listeners. Now the system is changing, and all households will have to contribute.The hoary old show finds itself in the middle of a nationwide debate over whether the public is getting its money’s worth. “They hardly ever come up with anything that validates all the money pumped into this system,” said Marc Felix Serrao, a journalist with the newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung.It’s all part of a larger soul searching over why Germany, with great traditions in literature, theater and film, has mostly missed the current wave of challenging, complex television. Der Spiegel asked in its latest issue, “Why are Germans the only ones sleeping through the future of TV?” The magazine called German programs “fainthearted, harmless, placebo television.”“Wetten, Dass ...?” has been swept up in the debate over the content of public television shows. “On the one hand, they are supposed to produce artistically outstanding programs because that legitimizes funding and the reason for having public-service broadcasters,” said Dominik Graf, a director whose series about the Russian mafia in Berlin, “Im Angesicht des Verbrechens” (“In the Face of Crime”), is often compared to “The Wire.” “But on the other hand, the functionaries at film funds only talk about the viewership figures.”The German television landscape is filled with reality shows including modeling and singing competitions. Newspapers meticulously track the goings-on in the jungle camp on the celebrity “Survivor” show “I’m a Star, Get Me Out of Here.” But the loudest criticism is usually reserved for “Wetten, Dass ...?”The broadsides reflect “disappointed love” from a generation weaned on the program, said Matthias Kalle, deputy editor in chief of the magazine at the weekly Die Zeit.At its peak “Wetten, Dass ...?” could attract an almost unthinkable 23 million viewers. The popular coming-of-age novel “Generation Golf,” by Florian Illies, begins with a 12-year-old boy in a bathtub, looking forward to watching the show that night. “Never again in later years would one have such a safe feeling of doing exactly the right thing at the right time,” Mr. Illies writes.Mr. Gottschalk began hosting in 1987 and established himself as one of biggest stars in Germany. With his frizzy blond mullet and outlandish suits he brought the off-kilter vibe of a Mad Hatter and the eccentricity of Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka to a mainstream television show. By contrast many critics have described Mr. Lanz as a dutiful, hardworking schoolboy.Judged solely by the number of live audience members avidly taking photos, the show still has a strong pulse. “I find the way he does it quite positive,” Bernd Ruhlich, 47, said of Mr. Lanz. Mr. Ruhlich came with his wife, Beate, and their two children to watch the January edition of the show. (The show appears about seven times a year.)The producers don’t make it easy on themselves. Instead of presenting the program on the same soundstage, it’s a roadshow. A crew of about 250 workers must build the set anew — complete with 35 trucks filled with speakers, lights and dressing rooms — in locations all over Germany and even abroad. The show is co-produced by ORF, the Austrian public broadcaster, and has also been staged in Majorca, Spain.The latest stop in this “wandering circus,” in the words of one network employee, was a convention hall in this southwestern German city.For English-speaking stars like Mr. Washington, there are translators talking into an earpiece. Every time he spoke, a disembodied voice echoed him in German, sometimes declaring “ja” or “nein” when he only nodded or shook his head.The show can run longer than three hours. In November the actor Tom Hanks looked miserable in a hat with cat ears as Mr. Lanz hopped around him in a potato-sack race. “In the United States if you are on a TV show that goes for four hours, everybody responsible for that show is fired the next day,” Mr. Hanks told a radio station.For Mr. Lanz those comments dealt a serious blow, much dissected in the German news media. Mr. Washington lampooned the fuss by donning the same hat before saying that it looked better on Mr. Hanks.Mr. Washington may have been the biggest star of January’s show, but Mr. Lanz was the hardest working personality. Over the course of the show he danced with a male guest in a tutu, lifting him several times. He competed against an audience member in a memory competition — while both pulled on a rowing machine — and won. A gargantuan contestant even demonstrated the elbow-drop wrestling move, leaping into the air and falling on a prone Mr. Lanz.Mr. Lanz and Mr. Washington were joined onstage by a hulking Olympic discus gold medalist, a legend in the skiing-and-shooting biathlon and several German film and television stars. On a giant screen overhead a montage of movie clips showed the young film star Matthias Schweighöfer’s bare backside.Mr. Washington had a film to promote, and there are few better places to do that in Germany, which is Europe’s largest economy. Mr. Lanz rolled clips of “Flight,” and Mr. Washington served pretzels to moviegoers at a nearby theater.That same night the audience of “Wetten, Dass ...?” watched a young man execute flips on a treadmill and a masseur identify different massage oils in front of a flower-power set complete with Volkswagen bus. Probably the highlight of the evening was a forklift driver and his partner who picked up tiny two-cent coins using the vehicle’s big metal forks and then dropped the money into a soda bottle.“If only the Greeks were so careful with their money,” Mr. Lanz said. The warehouse workers failed in their bet, getting only three of the required four coins into the bottle. Mr. Washington helped Mr. Siegel, the bottle plunker, and latest winner on “Wetten, Dass ...?,” into a brand-new Audi.“Everyone knows it, everyone has an opinion about it, so there’s a tendency to burden the state of ‘Wetten, Dass ...?’ at any given moment with a lot of meaning,” Mr. Kalle, the Die Zeit editor, said. “But it keeps going.”"

A “minus” — filmmakers beware.Mr. Koch wrote for Manhattan publications and posted video reviews on his Web site, mayorkoch.com, and a Twitter feed, @mayoratmovies. He saw several movies a week, and even if he sometimes got an actor’s name wrong —Angelina Jolie became Angela, andKeanu Reeves something like Keenew — his enthusiasm for film was as bright as his wit.He was a regular at the Angelika Film Center, which is now showing “Koch,” a documentary that opened on Friday.“Hi, I’m Ed Koch,” his reviews would sometimes begin. “And I’m a movie critic.”Then he would pause, daring you to disagree.WHAT HE LIKEDDrive. “Kind of a film noo-waa. ...

They represented a missed opportunity for marketers and agencies to demonstrate that they had at least some understanding of how contemporary consumers think and behave.Alas, the so-called creative minds of Madison Avenue chose once again to fall back on familiar strategies and themes that would have appealed more to viewers during the Eisenhower, Nixon, Reagan or Clinton administrations.There was a mother-in-law joke in a commercial for Century 21; a commercial for Audi that was set at a prom; a gag based on a young man’s nervous uttering of the word “panties” in a commercial for Mennen Speed Stick; a commercial for Pepsi Next that brought to mind the 1983 movie “Risky Business”; a commercial for Volkswagen whose humor quotient depended on whether viewers find ethnic dialects funny; a commercial for Coca-Cola that mashed up classic films like “Lawrence of Arabia,” “The Wild Bunch,” “Mad Max” and “The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert”; and a commercial that featured a chorus of leggy dancing girls dressed as Wonderful pistachios, echoing the 1950s commercials in which dancers were dressed as Old Gold cigarette packs.The vintage vibe was underlined by a preoccupation with space. At least four commercials — for Axe Apollo, E*Trade, the Kia Sorento and Lincoln — included images of astronauts. It seemed as if at any moment there would be a spot for Tang.There was also the usual overreliance on tried and true — read: “tired” — Super Bowl ad tactics. Anthropomorphic animals abounded in spots for brands like Cars.com, Doritos and Skechers, and slapstick violence, with men always the victims, in spots for brands like the Kia Forte.Fortunately, all was not dross. There were some enjoyable and effective commercials mixed among the clunkers, particularly those that sought to be timely by including in their plots New Orleans, the site of Super Bowl XLVII, or references to the contenders, the Baltimore Ravens and the San Francisco 49ers.Here is a look at some of those outstanding spots.BUD LIGHT Two compelling commercials for Bud Light, brewed by the Anheuser-Busch division of Anheuser-Busch InBev, featured Stevie Wonder as a mysterious purveyor of “mojo” for football fans in New Orleans. He was spooky enough to warrant a shout-out at his next concert, “Do do that voodoo that you do so well.” Agency: Translation.BUDWEISER A spot for Budweiser beer, also from Anheuser-Busch, about a Clydesdale and a trainer, wore its heart on its sleeve, or its hoof. But the corn was sweet and tasty. Agency: Anomaly.M&M’S In a hilarious commercial for the M&M’s candy brand, sold by Mars, the character Red warbled “I’d Do Anything for Love (But I Won’t Do That)” to express his desire for a human woman, played by Naya Rivera of “Glee.” She reciprocated his ardor with a disturbing hunger for more than hugs. Agency: BBDO New York.MERCEDES-BENZ The plot of a commercial for the new Mercedes-Benz CLA echoed everything from “Faust” to “Damn Yankees.” And a dream sequence echoed a 2012 Super Bowl spot for Kia.Still, the commercial was infinitely better than an overheated teaser spot that promoted it. It also had a nice New Orleans atmosphere, Willem Dafoe as Lucifer, clever cameo appearances by Condé Nast magazines like GQ, and a punch line centered on a selling point, the car’s sticker price. Agency: Merkley & Partners.OREO A spot for Oreo, sold by Mondelez International, also stood out for its focus on a selling point, in this instance the longtime debate among brand fans over the “best part”: is it the cookie or the cream filling?The most delicious moment came when a police officer trying to break up an Oreo fight in a library whispered through his bullhorn. The commercial ended with a 21st-century twist by asking viewers to “choose your side on Instagram.” Agency: Wieden & Kennedy.TACO BELL O.K., a spot for the Taco Bell division of Yum Brands — about elderly friends who escape a retirement home for the kind of night out their grandchildren would enjoy — plays like a product-placement version of “Cocoon” crossed with the “Kick the Can” segment of “Twilight Zone: The Movie.”Yet there were some sharp sight gags, especially the glimpse at the end of a character’s tattoo. And the Spanish-language version of the Fun. tune “We Are Young” that played on the soundtrack might make the song a hit all over again. Agency: Deutsch L.A.TIDE A delightful commercial for Tide, sold by Procter & Gamble, told a fanciful tale of a “miracle stain” on a 49ers fan’s jersey that resembled the team’s former star quarterback, Joe Montana. The sendup of media hype was knowing, and the surprising punch line was perfect. Agency: Saatchi & Saatchi.TOYOTA A commercial for the Toyota RAV4, sold by Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., evoked the ‘60s sitcom “I Dream of Jeannie,” with Kaley Cuoco stepping in for Barbara Eden. But the spot had its own charms, particularly how the wishes granted by the genie careered from charming to chaotic. Agency: Saatchi & Saatchi Los Angeles."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/business/media/thomas-tull-of-legendary-entertainment-faces-a-critical-juncture.html,"LOS ANGELES — During the baseball strike of 1995, Thomas Tull, then a 24-year-old laundromat owner, was audacious enough to turn up at a training camp for the Atlanta Braves. They looked at his swing and sent him home.No matter. Mr. Tull swatted through the entrepreneurial minor leagues, from laundries to tax prep centers to dot-com start-ups, and into Hollywood.His aggressiveness and aw-shucks charm made him one of the most successful walk-on players in movie history. “The Dark Knight,” “300,” “The Hangover” and “Clash of the Titans” were all made with backing from his company, Legendary Entertainment, a Warner Brothers affiliate, which picked up more than $700 million in new financing last year.But the coming months will tell if Mr. Tull really is the latest outsider to win an insider’s game.Legendary is a supplier of six major releases by Warner from March to August, giving it an unusually large portion of the blockbuster season. If they are successful, Mr. Tull, 42, may come to be viewed as a budding Steve Ross, who used the resources of Kinney National Services, which operated parking lots, to build Time Warner: Legendary’s goal is to continue to grow. But failure could tip Legendary in the direction of the original DreamWorks SKG. That company, backed by Paul Allen, the Microsoft co-founder, started big and fizzled.Already, some thorny problems have surfaced. Last month, Mr. Tull became embroiled in two lawsuits over an expensive “Godzilla” remake that is supposed to begin production shortly. Legendary’s forays into China as well as television and comic book publishing have failed or had a shaky start.The Warner-Legendary relationship oscillates between cool and frosty, with Mr. Tull at times telling cohorts that he is taken for granted and various studio executives vexed by his success and efforts to be seen as a creative force and not just a writer of checks.Mr. Tull, who declined to comment, is betting hundreds of millions of dollars on his next films. Sequels to “The Hangover” and “300” are almost guaranteed hits. But others are substantial risks. “Jack the Giant Killer,” an embellishment of “Jack and the Beanstalk,” comes on the heels of several fairy tale adaptations that disappointed at the box office.“Man of Steel” is an expensive attempt to revive a well-worn Superman franchise. The less costly “42” is something Legendary once said it would never make — a drama, in this case the life story of Jackie Robinson.The biggest gamble is “Pacific Rim.” Directed by Guillermo del Toro, it is a $150 million movie, set to open July 12, about human-piloted robots and alien monsters. Legendary is breaking its pattern of equal partnership with Warner by shouldering 75 percent of the cost, and is hoping the film will jump-start a merchandise business. Mr. Tull is also counting on “Pacific Rim” to convince skeptical industry peers that he has the creative acumen to generate a critical smash without Warner to lean on.(Mr. del Toro is already a convert. “With Thomas,” he said in a phone interview, “the reactions are the same reactions you would get from another filmmaker.”)Soon, Legendary must make a crucial decision about its future. Mr. Tull’s deal with Warner expires at the end of this year. So far, no serious talks about a renewal have started, according to both companies, partly because Mr. Tull was waiting for Warner to pick a chief executive to succeed Barry M. Meyer, who is retiring. Kevin Tsujihara was named to the post last Monday.Warner declined to comment on its relationship with Mr. Tull. The studio would like him to stay, but it would not suffer terribly if he left, according to two high-level executives inside the company who requested anonymity to speak candidly. Warner, for instance, can rely on another financing partner, the newly revitalized Village Roadshow, these people said.Legendary is equally cool; a person with knowledge of Mr. Tull’s options, who asked for anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly, said that Legendary had interest from other studios, mentioning a bond between Mr. Tull and several senior executives at Universal and Comcast.This high-powered jockeying occurs a long way from the outskirts of Binghamton, N.Y., where Mr. Tull was raised poor by a single mother, a dental hygienist. Even he seems stunned by his rise in Hollywood, complete with a mansion in suburban Calabasas, Calif. — the nouveau riche nesting place of the Kardashians — and a small ownership stake in the Pittsburgh Steelers. (He made a failed bid for the San Diego Padres last summer.)“If somebody came in and pitched me as a script, I would say it’s too far-fetched,” Mr. Tull said in a 2010 television interview.He arrived here about a decade ago as a midlevel venture capitalist, working on technology start-ups with the Convex Group, based in Atlanta. He helped hatch an ill-fated plan to create disposable DVDs that would self-destruct in 48 hours, making for return-free rentals.In 2004, Mr. Tull and William Fay, a friend and producer, decided to buy a film library from which they could produce effects-driven remakes and sequels. They settled on Orion Pictures, owned by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. A third partner, Scott Mednick, soon joined.But Sony and others took MGM’s assets off the market, leaving Mr. Tull stuck on Hollywood’s doorstep.“Let’s just forget about the library,” Mr. Fay recalls Mr. Tull saying. “Let’s just build a film company around the precepts we’ve developed.”Private equity money was just starting to flow into films, and Mr. Tull secured financing of about $500 million, which Legendary used to land a partnership with Warner for pictures geared to the young male audience.Good fortune played a role in Mr. Tull’s ascendance. Legendary, for instance, was partly sold to its first round of investors on a faulty premise — that strong DVD sales had put a floor under high-end fantasy films. But the DVD market crumbled in 2005, almost exactly as Legendary took root.“It ultimately worked on a different logic,” acknowledged Clark Callandar, who had helped organize Legendary as an investment banker at the Perseus Group, now known as GCA Savvian. He said strong foreign sales made up for the collapse in the DVD market.Mr. Tull also caught a break in his early dealings with Warner. Shaken by the troubled merger of its parent company with AOL, Warner was hungrier than usual for filmmaking capital. Some of its equity-backed producers were also moving on. So Warner offered Legendary a position in “Superman Returns” and Christopher Nolan’s “Batman Begins,” the precursor to “The Dark Knight.”At the time, neither superhero was regarded as a sure bet; Batman in particular was considered worn out by earlier films. “It takes a certain amount of serendipity,” said Mr. Mednick, who spoke of Legendary’s early days last week. “Either you get lucky, or you don’t.” (Legendary’s next few films after “Batman,” including “Lady in the Water” and “The Ant Bully,” were flops.)The departures of his initial partners have solidified Mr. Tull’s position as Legendary’s majority owner, and he has worked to raise his profile. Last summer, he even stole some limelight, which executives here usually avoid, from his own movies when he took the stage in front of 6,000 fans at a Legendary-branded Comic-Con International presentation.Legendary would like to be Marvel Entertainment, the comic-book powerhouse now owned by Disney that has generated hits like the “Iron Man” films. But Marvel owns a vast trove of characters. Legendary, having never acquired the library Mr. Tull wanted, initially depended on Warner for material, and, more recently, has turned to some unlikely sources. For instance, it tried to make an action-thriller based on Milton’s “Paradise Lost.”Legendary Comics, announced in 2010, is partly an effort to build a pool of intellectual property. Breaking into publishing is difficult, but the endeavor has been “an awfully slow burn” so far, said Jonah Weiland, executive producer of Comic Book Resources, a Web site about graphic novels. Legendary’s first comic, “Holy Terror,” was “widely panned,” he added. A second, “The Tower Chronicles,” based on one of Mr. Tull’s ideas, has not fared much better.Legendary has a history of starts and stops. Mr. Tull is eager to expand into China and last year recruited executives for a unit that was to make two to three movies there annually, starting this year with a fantasy thriller about the Great Wall. But the expected Chinese financing for the venture has yet to materialize. A television division was shut down after a year and a half. A video game division also hiccupped; last summer, Legendary regrouped in the digital arena by buying the Web brand Nerdist Industries, a media company focused on pop culture.All the while, Mr. Tull has shown himself willing to throw elbows. Robert Redford proposed a Jackie Robinson story to Legendary, and expected to act in the movie, but Legendary soon announced “42” without him. Steven Spielberg’s production company acquired a video game property about monsters, developed it as a movie for the director Tim Burton, and then had to drop it because “Pacific Rim” was too similar.Mr. Tull has also turned to the courts to protect his interests. In two lawsuits in 2009, he and Legendary sued a former employee for breach of contract and extortion. The suits, filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court, were quickly resolved. Still, the legal complaints offered a public record of internal turmoil, layoffs and financial distress at Legendary in the years before huge returns from “The Dark Knight” brought the illusion of overnight success.Last month, another lawsuit, filed in the Superior Court by Mr. Tull against three producers who had been involved with his “Godzilla” project — he wanted them removed from the movie with little compensation, and they balked — prompted a countersuit that painted an unflattering picture of Legendary’s business practices, and gave a rare glimpse at fierce infighting within the Warner family. The countersuit claims that the producers were dismissed “out of greed or to show some sort of creative dominance.”What is Mr. Tull’s end game? An initial public offering has always been an option, although even with his Wall Street prowess that might be a tough sell at the moment, given Legendary’s risky summer. But detractors would be smart to remember that Mr. Tull has pulled off home runs against long odds before."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/tabasco-a-super-bowl-staple-adds-a-spicy-twist.html,"AVERY ISLAND, La. — Walter Stauffer McIlhenny, the fourth chief executive of the McIlhenny Co., the makers of Tabasco sauce, was a farsighted risk taker. The son of one of Theodore Roosevelt’s Rough Riders, he was an expert marksman who was wounded at Guadalcanal in 1942. He did not have the bullet in his leg removed until the next year so he could keep fighting.After the war, he helped turn Tabasco into a global brand. A prominent businessman in New Orleans, he bought a slice of the Saints before their first season in the N.F.L. in 1967. That savvy investment included 50-yard-line seats to Saints home games and the Super Bowl when it was played in New Orleans.But when Uncle Walter, as he was known to his extended family, died a bachelor in 1985, none of his cousins took his stake in the Saints. So the stake was sold and with it access to those seats.“They were wonderful; you could pound on the metal deck at Tulane Stadium and make a lot of noise,” said Paul C. P. McIlhenny, the current chief executive of the McIlhenny Co., who attended several Super Bowls and many Saints games. “Shame on us for not keeping them.”The family’s ties to sports run deeper than Walter’s stake in the Saints. Several men in the family were collegiate football stars, and a few others played in the N.F.L., including Hugh McElhenny, a Hall of Fame running back who played most of his career with the 49ers in the 1950s. About a decade ago, the McIlhennys passed up a chance to buy the naming rights to the Superdome because it would have required purchasing television advertising during games played there, which made the proposition too expensive. The company has sponsored golfers, cyclists, a Nascar team, as well as the Tulane baseball team.The company’s most enduring connection to sports, though, may be Tabasco itself. One of the country’s best-selling hot sauces, it is a staple at Super Bowl parties and other sporting events where pizza, Buffalo wings, dips and other finger foods are served.The Tabasco factory here, about 150 miles west of New Orleans, has been working overtime to keep up with the seasonal jump in demand. For three-quarters of the year, production lines operate in two 10-hour shifts four to five days a week, producing 750,000 bottles daily.In November, as the holidays and the N.F.L. playoffs approach, the company adds an extra day of production. This year, the company may get an extra bump in sales because the Super Bowl is in New Orleans, where Tabasco has a strong presence.“The Super Bowl event is the single biggest month for hot sauce. It’s huge,” said Paul McIlhenny, sitting in the company’s boardroom under a portrait of Edmund McIlhenny, who created Tabasco sauce after the Civil War.While its signature red sauce makes up more than 60 percent of Tabasco sales, the company has been promoting its new Buffalo style hot sauce, and it created a commemorative bottle for this year’s Super Bowl that includes Mardi Gras colors and a football on the label. Some of the proceeds will be donated to Taste of the NFL, an organization that fights hunger.The McIlhennys have spent handsomely over the years to reinforce their message that Tabasco is a natural fit with football. During the Super Bowl in 1998, the company paid $1.3 million to run one of the more memorable 30-second television ads.In the commercial, a young man sits on a porch on a warm night pouring copious amounts of Tabasco sauce on his pizza. The man watches as a mosquito lands on his leg and sucks out some of his blood. The mosquito then flies off and explodes from the Tabasco sauce it drank. The man grins.“It was the only time we spent that much on a single ad, but we got a lot of mileage out of that one,” Paul McIlhenny said.The commercial succeeded because it spoke directly to the audience, namely football fans munching on snacks. It also made a brand that had become synonymous with hot sauce popular again.“Their advertising makes their current users feel cool about using it,” said Ronald C. Goodstein, who teaches marketing at Georgetown University’s McDonough School of Business.The danger, Goodstein said, is that Tabasco will become a victim of its own success, so big that it might lose appeal to younger consumers who want to distance themselves from “their dad’s hot sauce” and instead claim a small, perhaps local brand of sauce as their own.In New Orleans, for example, Crystal is only the official hot sauce in the Superdome, but is favored by many residents who claim it tastes better than Tabasco, which critics say is more about heat than flavor. To combat this, the McIlhennys have expanded their line of Tabasco sauces. They also license Tabasco to companies that produce Spam, A1 sauce and other condiments.Tabasco has faced other challenges. In 2005, high winds and rain from Hurricane Rita flooded the company’s factory and pepper fields, and six days of bottling were lost. The company has since built a 17-foot levee to protect its only production facilities.All Tabasco sauce is made on Avery Island, where the company produces the seeds that are sent overseas to be grown into peppers, which are turned into mash and sent back to Louisiana. The traditional red sauce is then aged for three years in one of the 70,000 old wooden whisky barrels that are stacked six high in two warehouses. The mash is then mixed with vinegar and stirred for one month. The skins and seeds of the peppers are removed before bottling.The process has changed little over the decades; the Tabasco bottle is still modeled after the cologne style bottles used for the first batch of the sauce that was produced in 1868. This tradition appeals to many consumers, including the former running back Gale Sayers and the former quarterback Y. A. Tittle, who, along with other celebrities, have visited the factory.Others, like John Madden, the former football coach and television analyst, pour the sauce on practically everything they eat.“I’ve had thousands of meals with him, and there is not a food out there that he doesn’t use Tabasco on,” Madden’s agent, Sandy Montag, said. “He puts it on food from the time he wakes up. For him, it’s like toothpaste.”Paul McIlhenny presented Madden with a 12-ounce personalized bottle of Tabasco when Madden visited New Orleans for a game.Bottles of Tabasco sauce have made their way into an opera; a Charlie Chaplin film; and, for a brief period, onto the side of Darrell Waltrip’s racecar, according to Shane Bernard, the company historian. One-eighth ounce bottles of Tabasco are also affixed with the presidential seal and provided on Air Force One.In the company’s archives housed in an old school on Avery Island, Bernard pulled out a file filled with documents from Walter McIlhenny’s days as part owner of the Saints. One letter, with “AFL” and “NFL” printed at the top, invited Saints season-ticket holders to buy tickets to Super Bowl IV, in 1970, the first to be played in New Orleans. At the bottom, someone noted that a check had been sent for $120.50 for eight tickets.Not all things stay the same."

Mr. Gibney’s “methods are a blend of solid journalism and cinematic sensationalism,” A. O.

There is something to be said for a clear and unblinking recitation of facts, and thankfully Mr. Gibney does a lot of that.” But the heart of the film, “the real source of its emotional impact,” Mr. Scott said, “lies in a remarkable series of interviews with some of the men, most now in their 60s, who endured Father Murphy’s assaults when they were children and who have worked for almost 40 years to bring his crimes to light.” John Slattery, Jamey Sheridan, Chris Cooper and Ethan Hawke interpret their words.8 A.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/business/media/at-fx-a-playbook-that-gives-its-series-free-rein.html,"The FX channel can be a rugged place, full of prostitutes, charlatans, spies, bikers and thugs. But it’s a nice place if you are trying to make a show.How come? Because the guy who is greenlighting the shows, John Landgraf, the president and general manager of FX Networks, spent many years making them himself, or at least trying to make them.He learned early on that the guidance he received from the networks was not going to lead to remarkable television.“I always got the same dumb note from the networks. ‘Can you make the character more likable?’ ” he recalled last week in a phone interview. “Not make them more exciting, more compelling, more interesting, no, it was always make them more likable.”Mr. Landgraf, who worked as a network executive at NBC during the ’90s and had a hand in “Friends,” “ER” and “The West Wing,” went on to form a television production company with Danny DeVito. He had 53 projects in development from 1999 to the early 2000s — nine that became pilots, six that were made into shows and one, “Reno 911!” that made it beyond a single season, albeit on Comedy Central.“It was crazy-making,” he said.He became convinced that network television was broken — that in an effort to make characters more likable, the industry made television that not anyone much liked.Mr. Landgraf’s turn on the other side of the table came in 2004 when he became president of FX, the basic cable channel owned by News Corporation. He inherited “Nip/Tuck” and “The Shield,” but they were aging and he needed to replace them, so he went on a spree — of saying yes.“We wanted to adapt our process to what the creatives needed and have a more efficient outcome,” he said. “We write a check to fund the production and they send us the shows. By trusting the people you work with — sharing the authority — and being willing to fail, things have gone pretty well for us.”He said yes to a lot of dark and spicy fare — it is not as lurid as pay cable can be, but it is only technically less naked. And it is clearly intended for adults.With that in mind, he said yes to the comedian Louis C.K., who had been flailing on HBO and then tried to come up with something that networks would swallow. In exchange for producing a pilot for almost nothing, Louis C.K. had complete freedom. The result was a brutally funny mash-up of sitcom and stand-up that clicked for FX.He also said yes to “Archer,” an animated period-spy series — nothing about those three things says television gold — about an agent with high testosterone and a low I.Q. It contains some of the most remarkable, densely funny writing on television.“It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia” has improbably lived, going into syndication with, you guessed it, the least likable group of characters you could conjure. Last week, I happened to see the comedian W. Kamau Bell in New York and thought, this guy is funny, somebody should give him a show. Somebody already had, on FX.Mr. Landgraf spent money on “Justified,” a Southern gothic inspired by Elmore Leonard that featured a laconic, trigger-happy marshal chasing charismatic, speechifying villains who belong in the television pantheon. He gave the go ahead to “American Horror Story,” a lurid, scary weekly trip to the dark side. And he said yes to “Sons of Anarchy,” a wildly popular drama that would be described, in industry speak, as Hamlet on Harleys.Mr. Landgraf is not just a yes man. He has shunned reality shows because, as he succinctly explained, “I don’t like them.”He has had his failures, including “Dirt,” “The Riches” and “Terriers.”“In our industry, shows are ‘not renewed,’ never ‘canceled.’ ” he said. “I’ve canceled shows and I think you have to own those failures to learn from them.”Mr. Landgraf is treasured by writers on the beat because, in an industry built on euphemism, he says what he thinks.It’s not that the rest of the industry lacks taste, it’s just most are so busy living in fear that a creative risk seems out of the question.“Back when we were pitching ‘Justified,’ FX was our last meeting,” said Graham Yost, the show’s executive producer. “John asked questions nobody asked, good, smart questions that demonstrated an understanding of what we trying to do.”When a television executive talks about brave programming decisions, it’s usually from the bottom of the ratings heap, but Mr. Landgraf has used original programming and aggressive spending on big movies — rather than network reruns — to climb out of the pile.January was the best rated month in the channel’s history, and the network is up 28 percent in total viewers from a year ago, and up 37 percent in the treasured 18-to-49 demographic.Sometime in the next year, FX will be on pace to earn half a billion in profit. Those aren’t Fox News numbers, but it is quite an improvement for a channel that did not have meaningful profits when Mr. Landgraf took over. He and his team will soon get control of FX2, a perennial basement dweller, and reapply the operational lessons to try to replicate the success.“Being ‘talent friendly’ is a trite old Hollywood cliché that is often spoken but seldom lived,” said Peter Rice, chairman of Fox Broadcasting. “What makes John unique is that you can see those beliefs in the adventurous choices that he makes.”Mr. Landgraf said that failure is a fact of life in entertainment, but that he and his team had been experiencing less of it lately.“Power is only of value if you give it away,” he said. “You have to be willing to give it away, to entrust your career, your reputation and your future to others, to make something that is remarkable.”In that sense, Mr. Landgraf and FX are not unique. HBO, which hit pay dirt with “The Sopranos,” is built on finding and backing the modern auteurs of television. Showtime is finding traction the same way, and AMC broke new ground in basic cable with “Mad Men.”Last week, FX unveiled its own version of a modern period drama with “The Americans,” about a spy couple living on the sly in suburban America.“House of Cards,” another shiny bit of original programming, started streaming on Netflix last week, a rare entrant from off the established television grid. Mr. Landgraf does business with Netflix and is happy to compete with the service, but it drives him crazy that its executives say they will not release ratings or any metrics on viewing of the highly promoted show.It’s clear that what is at stake for him is winning, and you can’t do that without keeping score.Mr. Landgraf is an odd mix for a television executive, lavish in his praise of his competitors while making it clear he would like to run them over. He is not short on ambition.“If you make one show that works, you might have gotten lucky, but we now have half a dozen shows that are working,” he said. “And we’ve done it by making small bets with big risks.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/arts/music/allison-weiss-at-public-assembly.html,"In 2008 Allison Weiss released an EP called “The Only Girl at an All-Boys Pool Party,” the last song of which was “I Was an Island.” It’s a jagged little number, with scratchy guitars and sweet, yelping vocals, part pop-punk, part confident ’80s rock. The lyrics are imaginative, wounded and direct, and they begin like this:I was an island before you came alongPut your boat in my sand, hand in my hand,Your heart in my songI was a fighter, and I was so braveBut I lowered my sword when you held me and sworeYou’d stay stay stay.The next year, the same song appeared at the beginning of “... Was Right All Along,” Ms. Weiss’s first full-length studio album, but in radically revamped form. Ms Weiss swapped out serrated punk for light acoustic folk, and where before she had spit out the lines with fury and angst, this version was resigned and smooth, even a little whimsical. (In 2011 she released an EP named for this song, featuring both versions.)“I Was an Island” was the first song Ms. Weiss played Friday night in the compact back room of Public Assembly, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn — the angrier, punkier version, and it suited her well. It’s also the approach she uses on her strong and impressively tart new album, “Say What You Mean” (No Sleep), due in April, which is full of unfashionable but still effective pop-punk with acoustic tendencies.Nowadays we can watch our future stars grow up in real time, thanks to a combination of increasingly plentiful and accessible content and social-media-enabled narcissism. You have access to the early mistakes but also to the choices an artist makes over time that add up to a persona. Ms. Weiss, who is 25, has been on display for years, figuring it out in public.She attracted early notice when, during the first months of Kickstarter in 2009, she crowdsourced the money for an album, something that’s now commonplace for artists with passionate niche fan bases but that felt revolutionary at the time. Last year she toured as a backup singer with and opening act for Lou Reed. She also embarked on a project of recording songs she’d written as a youngster, for a project called “The Teenage Years.”“Say What You Mean,” which was produced crisply by Chris Kuffner, features some new songs, and some that have been repurposed and beefed up from her earlier releases. She drew heavily from that collection on Friday in an energized and infectious performance that cut through the album’s proud, strident melancholy.It helps that Ms. Weiss, who sings and plays guitar, has a cheerful presence, letting anger guide her only within the confines of her songs. At the end of a mean new one called “Hole in Your Heart” she stopped cold, enhancing the song’s punch. But then she started speaking about what it was like to move to New York a few years ago, and the tiger became a kitten.That led to a quiet song called “Wait for Me,” which had flickers of Randy Newman wit, something that pops up a lot in Ms. Weiss’s songwriting, which often relies on cheeky turns of phrase (“I hate to say I like the way you love to lead me on,” and so on). Sometimes Ms. Weiss’s sturdy band — Peter Recine on guitar, Liam McCormack on bass, Joanna Katcher on synths and Keith Sidorowicz on drums — got the better of her. She has a gentle and narrow voice, easily absorbed. But her songs demand force, and they were delivered that way, particularly by Mr. Sidorowicz, who played with authority.This was especially so on “Don’t Go,” the night’s last song and a far feistier one than anything else Ms. Weiss played, including the sharp single “Making It Up.” The band got rowdy, Ms. Weiss tossed off some witty gripes — “I can always count on you to count me out” — and once again she evolved in full view of everyone."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/sports/football/super-bowl-phil-simmss-announcing-was-short-on-analysis.html,"I was wondering if Sean McManus, the chairman of CBS Sports, slipped into the network’s booth at the Superdome on Sunday night to give Jim Nantz and Phil Simms a pep talk.Their broadcast of the Super Bowl was decent enough, but it sounded as if they weren’t seeing the big picture. McManus could have told them to be bolder, to tell us what we didn’t see, to make us take notice.While praising the offense of the Baltimore Ravens, who led, 21-6, at halftime, they were not nailing what was wrong with the San Francisco 49ers’ defense.Were the 49ers missing assignments or missing tackles? Was the Ravens’ game plan simply so much better?Was Coach John — as Simms and Nantz insisted on calling him — outcoaching Coach Jim?Why, after 49ers cornerback Chris Culliver was burned for a touchdown by Jacoby Jones, did neither announcer mention that last week he had to apologize for making antigay comments?Why, with so much hype about Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis playing his final game after 17 years, did they pay so little attention to what he was doing (or not doing) on the field?Lewis, that most ubiquitous of men, was rediscovered in the fourth quarter, with a statistic (four tackles) and a discussion of the murder charges against him that were dropped in 2000 and his polarizing personality. That’s a long time not to notice someone so integral to the Ravens.But Justin and Aldon Smith, two of the 49ers’ defensive stars, stayed missing.Why did Simms flat-out say that he wouldn’t second-guess Baltimore Coach John Harbaugh’s risky decision to call a fake field goal, which failed to yield a first down? Second-guessing is Simms’s job. More important, he should be first-guessing.The second half began with Jones’s 108-yard kickoff return for a touchdown and a blackout at the Superdome that gave CBS a chance to replay, ad nauseam, the makeout session between the supermodel Bar Refaeli and the curly-haired nerd in a GoDaddy.com ad.But it went to commentary from its on-field studio crew in the dim light.Without a game to televise, James Brown, CBS’s studio host, and the sideline reporters Steve Tasker and Solomon Wilcots competed to tell viewers how long — 15 minutes? 20 minutes? “any moment”? — before the game could resume.The delay, and the Ravens’ 28-6 lead, conspired against keeping the audience, and approaching viewership records.(Through the end of the game, Simms and Nantz made no issue out of the failure of an N.F.L. official to appear on the sideline to explain the blackout to Tasker or Wilcots. Even without a full explanation, the N.F.L. should have provided someone to tell CBS what it knew.)Once the game resumed, Simms did not seem to draw inspiration from Beyoncé or studying highlights in the dark. He offered a trite truism about the 49ers, who were trailing badly: “When you’re down, you have to make great catches.”Simms then added this tortured analysis: “One thing I’ve taken out of this game, and really all through the playoffs, is if you watch it, the number of big plays in the games are because the quarterbacks are throwing the football.” (Yes, yes!) Arm strength, he emphasized, is important.Then, after the 49ers had amassed 105 post-blackout yards and 14 points, to the Ravens’ 15 yards, Simms said that the power failure had not hurt the Ravens but that it had helped the 49ers.That just sounded wrong.Later, he would all but refute his analysis when he said that the Ravens might have been thinking that they were close to winning the Super Bowl — a reason to play as if stuck in neutral.At the Super Bowl, a network’s announcers and production crew should be in sync. But when Simms praised how little effort 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick expended on a hot, sharp pass, there was no replay to show that easy delivery.Simms sounded out of sorts. He said that the Ravens came after Kaepernick with a “bunch group,” but did not say which defenders they were or if that was some sort of strategy.And with a fourth-and-goal for the 49ers at the Ravens’ 5 and 1 minute 50 seconds left, Simms did not venture a guess about the type of play that San Francisco should call, and he did not interrupt Nantz when he saw the defense the Ravens were setting up, which he said he detected afterward.He also delayed taking note, for too long, the contact made by the Ravens’ secondary against 49ers receivers in the end zone on Kaepernick’s incomplete pass.The game, which promised a great finale for much of the fourth quarter, ended without much of a bang — although one of CBS’s strong on-field microphones picked up Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco’s exuberant expletive, which he followed with the word “awesome.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/arts/music/melissa-aldana-quartet-at-jazz-gallery.html,"There was a time not long ago, before major-record labels almost completely cut their losses with jazz, when young bandleaders were busy covering bases and making cases. They wanted to show you how much they knew of the jazz tradition and how authoritatively they could play it. These were defensive actions, and also perhaps the last manifestations of hope that jazz could have a general listenership.Since then jazz has become more specific, more fragmented, and in some ways much freer. There seems to be less concern about quieting skepticism among musicians. Maybe there’s less arms-folded, O.K.-impress-me attitudes among jazz audiences. (Maybe there was never as much as had been thought.) In any case Melissa Aldana, 24, is doing it the old way. A tenor saxophonist from Chile, she’s gotten serious as a bandleader in New York over the last few years; she’s made two records on Greg Osby’s label, Inner Circle Music, with a move forward to this year’s “Second Cycle.” Her performance with her quartet on Thursday night, at the relocated Jazz Gallery, on Broadway at 27th Street, covered great range of form and sound: controlled and loose, old and new, learned and intuitive. She was patient but showed that she could be extravagant. She used some calculated set pieces but also let go of them.Her set started with “L-Line,” a piece that swung tightly and changed rhythm through a few different melodic strains, with an open section in the middle for her soloing. (The band — with Glenn Zaleski on piano, Pablo Menares on bass and Jochen Rueckert on drums — navigated it well.) It felt sure but mannered, full of a straight-ahead jazz-school intensity from about half a generation ago, and this is the part Ms. Aldana can afford to lose. It seemed she was borrowing a form and feeling that is perhaps not old enough to transform meaningfully. She demonstrated something about her skill and technique, but the music got much better after that.She played a version of Thelonious Monk’s ballad “Ask Me Now,” first telegraphing the chords of the piece through unaccompanied arpeggios, thick and rolling. When the band piled in, she started the melody in earnest, slowly, with a full and heavy tone, not what you’d expect from the person who’d played the darting figures earlier in the set. Strange things came out of her: long tones with deep warpings of pitch, figuratively following the motion of the tune — woozy, old-head eccentricity, as if she were channeling Don Byas or Harold Ashby, players who found their stride 70 years before her — and she finished with more arpeggios, but here she sliced them up, interrupting them with melody.Finally she moved toward a kind of music (including “First Cycle,” from her new record) that really felt like the current moment in jazz. These pieces opened up quickly, showing their seams, describing forms rather than adhering to them; the musicians in the band weren’t compelled to articulate every beat and every chord. Ms. Aldana worked over short motifs, using the full range of her instrument, articulating long and fast lines. But she also condensed her phrases into great wipes of sound up and down the horn, and clamped into the rhythm so that her notes seemed wired to Mr. Rueckert’s interplay of ride cymbal and snare. She wasn’t just exhibiting her own voice but embodying it; she seemed past the point of making her case."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/arts/music/lincoln-centers-american-songbook-series-at-allen-room.html,"Can one astoundingly gifted singer revive a beloved but dormant jazz vocal tradition? They say it takes only one to start a movement. As Cécile McLorin Salvant spun songs into a brilliant silk tapestry at the Allen Room on Saturday evening, I thought, “Here she is.” If anyone can extend the lineage of the Big Three — Billie Holiday, Sarah Vaughan, and Ella Fitzgerald — it is this 23-year-old virtuoso born in Miami to a French mother and a Haitian father and trained in France.Ms. Salvant has it all: perfect pitch and enunciation, a playful sense of humor, a rich and varied tonal palette, a supple sense of swing, exquisite taste in songs and phrasing, and a deep connection to lyrics. She fearlessly bends notes, but always toward an expressive purpose, and her scat improvisations are not the kind of vacuous ornamentation that has become the bane of contemporary jazz singing. Her temperament is sunny, but she is no simpering Pollyanna.For years music journalists have presumptuously proclaimed one or another aspiring jazz singer to be the next Billie, Sarah, or Ella the way rock critics in the 1970s used to announce “the new Dylan” every month or so. In contemporary jazz only one singer, the imperial and expansive Dianne Reeves, comes close to matching the Big Three. Now the question remains: given the totally different technological and cultural landscape that exists half a century after the golden age, can history repeat itself?Ms. Salvant’s performance with an excellent trio — Aaron Diehl on piano, Paul Sikivie on bass and Rodney Green on drums — was the crowning moment in the first four evenings of Lincoln Center’s American Songbook series. Each program was devoted to a different female singer. Wednesday’s opening night show brought the Broadway soprano Lea Salonga (“Miss Saigon,” “Les Misérables” and the voice behind two Disney heroines), but because of a scheduling conflict I had to miss her performance. Thursday evening the pop-gospel singer Valerie Simpson appeared, followed on Friday by the regal cabaret diva Karen Akers. You couldn’t ask for four more dissimilar musical sensibilities.A diversity of genres and artistic temperaments in pop music and jazz is what the American Songbook series, now in its 15th season, is all about. It allows audiences to explore music they might otherwise not encounter, in a glamorous setting (the Allen Room, at Jazz at Lincoln Center) at reasonable hours, in concerts with perfect acoustics and sensible running times (usually less than 90 minutes).Ms. Salvant’s most obvious forerunners are Vaughan and Betty Carter. Not quite as operatic as Vaughan or as self-consciously avant-garde as Carter, she makes a smooth, light, almost feathery sound, bordering on kittenish but with smoky traces, and she can suddenly open up her voice and unleash a cavernous contralto. When that happens, she is usually stressing the crucial phrases of a lyric like the punch line in Cole Porter’s witty, racy, swinging and very wise, “Most Gentlemen Don’t Like Love”: “They just like to kick it around.” It was one of four Porter songs in a set whose oldest selection was the bleak 1905 Bert Williams classic, “Nobody,” delivered with a penetrating edge.The most far-reaching performance was a rendition of “What a Little Moonlight Can Do,” a standard for both Holiday and Carter that she treated as a delirious ode to young love. It began as an abstract tone poem of cooing high notes, then floated down from the stratosphere and morphed into an accelerated fast-swinging celebration of erotic besottedness.The most introspective number, “There’s a Lull in My Life,” a ballad associated with Fitzgerald about missing your lover, was the opposite of “Moonlight,” and Ms. Salvant imbued it with a melancholic clarity. But the overriding spirit she conveyed was joy filtered through a keen intelligence.Euphoria was in the air at Ms. Simpson’s concert, a statement of renewal by a singer who seemingly lost everything when her husband and longtime singing and songwriting partner, Nickolas Ashford, died suddenly in August 2011. Since then Ms. Simpson has released a solo album, “Dinosaurs Are Coming Back Again” (CD Baby), whose title song she performed on Thursday. But most of the program offered Ashford and Simpson classics like “Ain’t No Mountain Enough,” “It Seems to Hang On,” “You’re All I Need to Get By,” “I’m Every Woman” and “Reach Out and Touch (Somebody’s Hand).”More than any musical couple I can remember, Ashford and Simpson portrayed eternal marital bliss in performances in which their happiness rarely seemed forced. Attending their later shows at Feinstein’s at Loews Regency, now closed, I was inevitably swept away on a wave of exuberance.Ms. Simpson was the feisty one; her husband the gentle love god. Her cheerleading aura, of someone fighting against the odds and winning, was even more palpable in this solo concert. Her fervent, unadorned pop-gospel delivery has lost little of its clout. As a vocal powerhouse she occupies a rung beneath Whitney Houston and Chaka Khan, but not too far below.Ms. Akers’s show, titled “Time Flies,” was as subdued and reflective as Ms. Simpson’s was extroverted. With a striking alto that evokes a more demure Carly Simon, Ms. Akers has been one of cabaret’s ranking art-song interpreters since the 1980s. Over the years she has steadily opened up emotionally. Accompanied by a trio of guitar, bass, and piano played by her musical director Don Rebic, she created a moving self-portrait of a lonely, isolated woman who finds herself betwixt and between.This coolest of cabaret divas infused “My Husband Makes Movies,” which she introduced in the Broadway musical “Nine,” with a spirit of wistful resignation. “I Miss the Mountains,” from the musical “Next to Normal,” in which a heavily medicated bipolar woman longs for the dangerous highs and lows of life without drugs, had much the same spirit.The show’s most wrenching performance, of the Schwartz-Dietz song, “By Myself,” Ms. Akers sang from the point of view of an isolated, emotionally shattered woman mustering the strength she has left to continue. Sadness and a sense of caution bordering on fear guided “Children Will Listen” from “Into the Woods.” Ms. Akers’s show was too quiet and melancholy to be crowd pleasing, but there was not an emotionally false note."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/arts/music/the-juilliard-schools-focus-2013-festival.html,"After conducting the Juilliard Orchestra in a vibrant performance of Mark-Anthony Turnage’s colorful “Ceres,” which received its New York premiere on Friday evening at Alice Tully Hall, Mark Wigglesworth turned to the audience and said that it used to be common practice to repeat a new work during a concert. So the ensemble played “Ceres” twice, offering a welcome chance to hear it again.The concert concluded the Juilliard School’s Focus! 2013, a weeklong series of free events exploring British music since World War II. “Thanks to Britten and Tippett, the contemporary British musical world is incredibly healthy,” Mr. Wigglesworth has said. Mr. Turnage is a prominent member of this thriving contemporary scene, with a catalog that includes a widely praised opera about Anna Nicole Smith.He was inspired to write “Ceres” after learning about the asteroid with that name and reading Bill Bryson’s “Short History of Nearly Everything.” In Mr. Turnage’s densely textured and engaging work, blocks of material collide and dissipate, evoking an otherworldly chaos and clutter. The Juilliard musicians illuminated the many intriguing timbral touches in “Ceres,” including the ominous rumblings from the lower strings, the climactic percussion outbursts and deft use of clarinet and trombone.Oliver Knussen, another prominent living British composer, wrote his Horn Concerto for Barry Tuckwell, an Australian performer who has spent much of his professional life as a member of British orchestras. Trevor Nuckols, a Juilliard undergraduate, was the excellent soloist in this one-movement work, a lyrical, enigmatic piece that illuminates a wide palette of colors from what Mr. Knussen has called his favorite instrument.The program opened with a committed and elegantly phrased rendition of the “Ritual Dances” by Tippett. Each of the dances, extracted from his opera “Midsummer Marriage,” is allied to one of the four seasons, reflected in titles like “The Earth in Autumn (The Hound Chases the Hare)” and “Fire in Summer (the Voluntary Human Sacrifice).”It seemed fitting that a work by Britten, whose centennial is being celebrated this year and whose work has inspired so many British musicians, concluded the festival. Mr. Wigglesworth conducted a full-blooded and stirring rendition of the powerful “Sinfonia da Requiem” (1940), whose plaintive strings, drumbeats, anxious pulse and eerily calm interludes reflect the composer’s reaction to the grim progression of World War II."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/movies/awardsseason/the-annual-nominee-luncheon-for-the-oscars.html,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — If the Oscars are a horse race, then the annual nominee luncheon here is the paddock. With the qualifying rounds over and voting set to begin, the competitors are ritually assembled for a high-wattage gathering and a cordial glass of Champagne or two before the bell rings and the jockeying starts in earnest.So Steven Spielberg, nominated for directing “Lincoln,” mixed with the team behind “Wreck-It Ralph,” while Mark Boal, a nominee for “Zero Dark Thirty,” smiled near Harvey Weinstein, who was pushing “Silver Linings Playbook.”“Your storytelling instincts are so right on,” the writer and director Phil Robinson said to Ben Affleck, who attended the lunch on behalf of “Argo.” Mr. Affleck bowed his head and said a humble, “Thank you.” (Mr. Robinson, an Academy governor, directed Mr. Affleck in “The Sum of All Fears.”)The rear of the International Ballroom of the Beverly Hilton here was transformed for the cocktail hour into something resembling a nightclub, a departure from previous years. Attendees gathered amid fake fog, a D.J. and blue lighting dim enough to challenge the Academy’s older ranks.The luncheon’s celebrity turnout is painstakingly monitored both by the Reporters Who Cover Hollywood and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. The luncheon is a two-way street: the Academy honors the nominees, treating all, for the moment, as winners — but the nominees are also expected to honor the Academy by showing up to rub shoulders with its governors.This year Academy publicists said 21 of the 25 nominees in the high-profile acting and directing categories attended. Missing were Emmanuelle Riva, a best actress contender for “Amour,” and that film’s director, Michael Haneke. Two supporting actor nominees, Alan Arkin (“Argo”) and Philip Seymour Hoffman (“The Master”), were absent.Ms. Riva had commitments in Europe that she could not break, and Mr. Haneke was busy directing an opera in Madrid, said Michael Barker, the co-founder of Sony Pictures Classics, which released “Amour.” A spokeswoman for Mr. Arkin said he was in New Orleans filming a new movie, “Grudge Match.” A publicist for Mr. Hoffman said he was tied up in New York.They missed blueberry vodka martinis, white orchid centerpieces and burrata cheese and honey-date appetizers. (The lightness and good cheer inside the hotel stood in contrast to a scene outside. Two anti-torture groups staged a silent protest of “Zero Dark Thirty,” a best picture nominee that has been criticized for its depiction of “enhanced interrogation” in the hunt for Osama bin Laden.)Monday’s luncheon, the 32nd of its kind, came as “Argo” continued to surge in the run-up to the Oscars, which will be held on Feb. 24 and televised by ABC. After winning the top prize at the Screen Actors Guild Awards on Jan. 27, “Argo” and Mr. Affleck also took home the biggest trophy at the Directors Guild Awards on Saturday.Where does that leave Team “Lincoln,” which had been the early front-runner? If Mr. Spielberg was sweating it, he didn’t look that way. He arrived at his table and warmly greeted Quvenzhané Wallis, the young best actress nominee. She seemed more interested in the flavor of her salad dressing, but Mr. Spielberg promptly removed the orchid centerpiece as he took his seat. “I want to be able to see her,” he said.The nominee luncheon is known for strained bonhomie — air kisses and hidden daggers — and, just as in the junior high cafeteria, a focus on who sits where. In the past the Academy has seated reporters by lottery. But last week the Academy spread the word that it would decide where reporters sat, prompting press corps whispering about the reasons behind the change. An Academy spokeswoman said, “We wanted to try something different.”As usual, the Academy used the gathering to admonish nominees to keep acceptance speeches short, should they be called onstage to collect a little gold statue. “Please speak from the heart, not from a piece of paper,” said Craig Zadan, a producer of this year’s telecast.And ... they’re off."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/arts/music/west-eastern-divan-orchestra-at-carnegie-hall.html,"Beethoven’s Ninth Symphony culminates with the ultimate call for understanding and joy among all people, the “just and unjust” alike, to translate a crucial phrase from Schiller’s “Ode to Joy,” the text for the final choral movement. Schiller describes joy as a gift of divinity to mankind. But only those who know the joy of forming an abiding friendship or winning the love of a spouse, only those who can call at least one soul theirs, are truly able to join in this song of praise.Though Schiller’s ode has a corny streak, in a good performance Beethoven’s stormy, celestial and exuberant music sweeps you away. And on Sunday afternoon at Carnegie Hall Daniel Barenboim conducted the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, the Westminster Symphonic Choir and four starry vocal soloists in a strongly conceived, sometimes impetuous yet finally triumphant account of the entire work. The performance concluded the orchestra’s four-concert survey of Beethoven’s nine symphonies that began last Wednesday night.The West-Eastern Divan Orchestra brings together young Israeli and Palestinian and other Arab musicians for an extensive summer training institute and international concert tours. Mr. Barenboim started it in 1999 with his good friend Edward W. Said, the Palestinian-American literary scholar, who died in 2003.The operating principle of the ensemble is that through working together and engaging in dialogue, young musicians from cultures steeped in enmity can find understanding. It is hard to think of a more appropriate piece for the players to perform on an important occasion. The concert was broadcast live on WQXR radio and is available for streaming on the station’s Web site (wqxr.org).Mr. Barenboim and the orchestra have recorded the complete Beethoven symphonies for Decca, available as a five-CD set and for downloading. That the players are immersed in these scores, and in Mr. Barenboim’s idiosyncratic approach to them, came through palpably on Sunday.The program began with Beethoven’s early Second Symphony, a vibrant performance in which Mr. Barenboim balanced the music’s Haydn-esque Classicism with its stirrings of Romanticism.In the first movement of the Ninth Symphony, Mr. Barenboim began with a broad tempo that highlighted the music’s mysteriousness. Things picked up when the orchestra burst forth with the fortissimo statement of the main theme. Yet, in striving for grandeur, the ponderous sometimes prevailed. The restrained overall tempo actually seemed to make it harder, at times, for the players to stay together and execute passagework cleanly. The surges in this tumultuous movement came through, though, and the climactic moments were terrifying.The presto second movement, despite moments of shaky playing, had drive and intensity. Mr. Barenboim and the orchestra were at their best in a magisterial account of the slow movement.In the final movement, when the unison cellos and basses first played the “Ode to Joy” theme, Mr. Barenboim kept the tempo restrained and the sound almost inaudible. It was as if the players were trying to channel the melody from some far-off realm. This was both an intriguing and fussy idea. But as the music progressed, the performance was impassioned, exciting and certainly never predictable.As always, the Westminster Symphonic Choir, directed by Joe Miller, sang with robust sound and confidence.Mr. Barenboim could not have had stronger vocal soloists. Two of them, the soprano Diana Damrau and the tenor Piotr Beczala, are starring in the Metropolitan Opera’s new production of Verdi’s “Rigoletto.” The luminous mezzo-soprano Kate Lindsey and the powerful bass René Pape were also splendid.The tumultuous ovation from the audience went on and on. At one point Mr. Barenboim circulated among the 90 members of the orchestra, shaking everyone’s hand. He did not miss a single musician, it seemed. It took a while. But the applause continued right through."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/arts/television/smash-nbc-musicals-2nd-season-with-jennifer-hudson.html,"The conventional wisdom about the first season of “Smash,” NBC’s musical within a soap opera, was that it started on a high note it couldn’t sustain. The pilot received overwhelmingly positive reviews, but by the last episode it was hard to find anyone who would say a kind word about the show. People were more likely to be tweeting about a misbegotten musical number or how much they hated Ellis, the personal assistant who filled the obligatory young Machiavellian schemer role in the style of “All About Eve.”The only problem with that take on “Smash” — which begins its second season with a two-hour premiere on Tuesday — is that the show was no good right from the start.The melodramatic excesses meant to entertain us during the seemingly endless gestation of the fictional (for now) musical “Bombshell” were never the real problem. The surprising thing about “Smash” was that a show meant to capture the magic of live theater could be so lifeless: flatly written, with a creeping sanctimoniousness and a middlebrow sensibility that seemed to reflect Hollywood’s idea of what would please a Wednesday matinee audience.All those qualities were present in the ballyhooed first episode, whose polish and catchy original song (“Let Me Be Your Star,” by Marc Shaiman and Scott Wittman) didn’t hide the two-dimensionality of the characters and an overall tenor that was less Broadway spectacular than basic-cable mini-series. (And despite a change in show runners, the addition of some high-profile stage actors and the departure of Ellis, Season 2 looks like more of the same.)It was also clear from the start that several key roles were not well cast. Debra Messing can be a charming comedian, but the suggestion of a complicated inner life is not part of her repertory, and she’s not very convincing in the part of a top Broadway lyricist. It doesn’t help that she was saddled with the most onerous of the first season’s tedious and nonsensical subplots, which wrapped together adoption, infidelity and a difficult teenage son. (One of the showbiz truisms the characters like to throw around is that putting on a musical leaves no time for a personal life; unfortunately that hasn’t been true.)Also problematic was the casting of Katharine McPhee, the 2006 “American Idol” runner-up, in the central role of Karen, the unknown from Iowa who competed to play Marilyn Monroe in the biographical musical “Bombshell” and who won the part, at least temporarily, at the end of last season. Ms. McPhee can sing well enough, and she looks good in a platinum-blonde wig, but she’s a limited actress and never captured the vividness and vulnerability of Monroe — not in her musical numbers, where you’d expect it, or as the offstage Karen, where it would be a nice bonus.Megan Hilty, who plays Ivy, Karen’s rival in the show’s odd dueling-ingénues setup — two Eves in search of a Margo — is a more accomplished stage performer and a more natural actress than Ms. McPhee, but she doesn’t make you say, “That’s Marilyn!” either. Given the sadistic way the story lines have treated Ivy, who can’t quite measure up to Karen’s Midwestern goodness, that could just mean that Ms. Hilty is doing exactly what’s required of her.“Smash” was supposed to be the show that got Broadway right while taking the karaoke inclinations of “American Idol” and “Glee” and turning them into respectable adult drama. But Broadway is a vicious, thrilling, glamorous place, and “Smash,” beyond some outré moments, has been small, wan and polite, more Hallmark than Bob Fosse. One sign of this is that what we’re told often doesn’t match with what we can see and hear. The director Derek (Jack Davenport, giving the show’s most consistently watchable performance) declares that Karen is Marilyn, but we can see that she isn’t. Everyone says “Bombshell” is great, but after 15 episodes it has barely come into focus, and the decent numbers we see are more than balanced by the harebrained ones like the “Mr. and Mrs. Smith” duet for Monroe and DiMaggio.The creator and primary writer of “Smash,” the playwright Theresa Rebeck, left after the first season, and the show is now in the hands of Joshua Safran, who was a producer on “Gossip Girl.” The early episodes of the new season feature a big guest star — Jennifer Hudson, playing a Broadway diva — reflecting the clout and budget of a show that counts Steven Spielberg among its producers. Also joining the cast is the young Broadway leading man Jeremy Jordan (“Newsies,” “Bonnie & Clyde”), giving a promising performance as a prickly songwriter.But there are not many signs that the show is taking a turn toward anything better — more realism, more audacity, less sentimentality. Ms. Messing’s Julia continues to struggle with her writing, not because writing is hard but because her marriage is messed up. Characters still say things like: “I’m your muse. It’s what we do.” Budding talents are still discovered at Schwab’s, or in this case after closing time on Restaurant Row in Manhattan. You could excuse all this stuff by saying, “Hey, it’s a musical.” But the more depressing truth is that it’s just a TV show."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/sports/football/lions-release-titus-young.html,The Detroit Lions said Monday they had released wide receiver Titus Young. Young was banished from the team in November for what Coach Jim Schwarz called unacceptable behavior and was later put on injured reserve. Young was also told to stay away from the team during its last off-season for punching his teammate Louis Delmas when Delmas was not looking.
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/arts/music/new-albums-by-my-bloody-valentine-josh-groban-and-tim-mcgraw.html,"MY BLOODY VALENTINE“m b v”(mybloodyvalentine.org)Early on Saturday evening My Bloody Valentine released “m b v,” its first record in 22 years, on its Web site, without much warning. Well, there was some: the English-Irish band’s principal songwriter and woolgatherer, Kevin Shields, had been promising a new album — but he’d been making those promises for almost half his life.Unsurprisingly, “m b v” sounds like a sequel to “Loveless,” its much-loved antecedent and highest achievement of the post-punk subgenre often called shoegaze. It builds out from the earlier record, and establishes the same relationship to your ears. Built into the music’s outer layers are distortion, reverb and slow, wavelike applications of Mr. Shields’s tremolo bar; down below are neutrally pretty and almost disembodied pop singing, by him or the rhythm guitarist Bilinda Butcher, as well as drumming minimized to a floppy stomp or a kick-drum thump. The drones of the Velvet Underground and La Monte Young are in there; so is the sweetness of the Carpenters.Listening to both records is a deeply interior act, and a safe one. You’re inside the music’s loud undulations, and inside your endlessly fascinating self. You are also inside your house, because you are a person of patience and a record collection, and it is perhaps not unusual that you stay home on Saturday nights.“Loveless” was often described as significant — No. 39 in Rolling Stone magazine’s best albums of the ’90s — but inasmuch as a work of art can alter a life, it asks very little and seemed to appeal to inarticulate parts of the brain. Mr. Shields, in an interview eight years after “Loveless,” made the point that he couldn’t understand more than a third of what critics were saying about it.The best part of “m b v,” which is a comparatively strong record given the length of the layoff and the almost complete absence of what you might call contemporary urgency, is a minute-long section of “Only Tomorrow.” It’s a simple song with kinks, like a lot of Mr. Shields’s work: the verse comes in nine-bar segments when you expect eight, and repeats twice when you’d expect once. And at the start and end of the long instrumental bridge — or whatever it is — Ms. Butcher, her voice echoed-up and edgeless, sings a single note that slowly rises high and disappears. During that same stretch, Mr. Shields’s guitar sound intensifies, becoming so overmodulated that it muffles the rest of the band and the track seems to crack into dust.This is vivid music, with color and texture and perhaps taste. On Sunday morning the critic Brandon Stosuy mentioned on Twitter that his young son, hearing the album, described it as sounding like a cookie in his ear. That is correct: shortbread, I’m pretty sure. Salty, granular.Mr. Shields’s pop instincts have become gnarled. He’s clearly spent some of the interim thinking more about harmony and structure than hooks: these songs, passive-aggressive as they may be, contain strong major-to-minor movements, irregular shapes, contrary motion between voice and guitars. But he’s also been thinking about currents in pop from the time of “Loveless” that have now become deeply dated: “Is This and Yes,” with organ-like keyboard sounds, harmonized vocal lines, and no guitar, resembles a slack version of late-’90s Stereolab; “In Another Way” and the whooshing, phasing “Wonder 2” use drum-and-bass rhythms; “New You” settles for a wan, medium-tempo Happy Mondays-like groove.Perhaps he’s been thinking about the terms on which he wants to be loved — not so much trying to find out what he’s worth to you, but what you’re worth to him. “Nothing Is,” three-and-a-half minutes long, repeats the same pummeling two-beat phrase, in guitar and machine drums, without variation. It’s not great art, but if you can put up with that, then you’ve made his cut. BEN RATLIFFJOSH GROBAN“All That Echoes” (Reprise)The final two minutes of Josh Groban’s new album ring clear with freewheeling entitlement, like the flash of a peregrine set aloft. At that point Mr. Groban is winding down a version of “I Believe (When I Fall in Love It Will Be Forever),” the Stevie Wonder song. Against a well-upholstered backdrop — orchestral strings, rock rhythm section, full-voiced gospel choir — he starts to vamp, singing what seem to be ad-libbed phrases with an uncharacteristically soulful inflection. He sounds as if he’s having a ball.That he also seems to be getting away with something highlights a core truth about Mr. Groban, the unassuming pop-operatic megastar. A sense of responsibility, more than any flights of fancy or fantasy, provides the defining trait of his recording career. “I don’t take it lightly,” he sings on one song here, “The trouble that I’ve gone to/To get you to know who I am.”Mr. Groban’s previous album, “Illuminations” (143/Reprise), presented him as a singer-songwriter, adding depth to his arsenal if not his appeal: it’s his least commercially successful album, though it has sold more than a million copies. “All That Echoes,” produced by Rob Cavallo, the chairman of Warner Brothers Records, has received a deluxe rollout: on Monday night a concert special was broadcast live in movie theaters across the country, and Mr. Groban has made himself cheerfully ubiquitous on the promotional circuit.As on “Illuminations,” he wrote most of the songs on the album, with various partners. One of the songs is in Spanish, with a gauzy cameo by the trumpeter Arturo Sandoval; two are in Italian, including “E Ti Prometterò,” a duet with Laura Pausini. This is terra firma for Mr. Groban and his fan base, as are some of the covers, like “Falling Slowly,” from the movie “Once,” and “The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress,” by Jimmy Webb. The singing is warm and temperate, emotionally expressive without any sign of strain.But there’s an intriguing tension in some of the other material, including the lead single, “Brave,” which could easily have been pegged to the Pixar film. The most evocative lyrical effort, “False Alarms,” written with Lester Mendez, hums with quiet struggle: “I can’t cage you in my arms,” Mr. Groban sings ruefully in the chorus, climbing toward his falsetto. Less flatteringly, “Below the Line” addresses the issue of poverty with a blithe emulation of Paul Simon’s “Graceland,” which is facile on more than one level.Of course constancy still suits Mr. Groban best, which is why “She Moved Through the Fair,” the matrimonial Irish folk song, works so handily here. And well before he takes those liberties in that Stevie Wonder song, he commits fully to these lyrics:The truths of love are planted firmThey won’t be hard to findAnd the words of love I speak to youWill echo in your mind NATE CHINENTIM MCGRAW“Two Lanes of Freedom”(Big Machine)Nashville has its modes and Nashville has its mode-breakers, though there are far fewer of those complicating matters these days, and anyhow, Tim McGraw has never been among them.“Two Lanes of Freedom” is his 12th studio album and first for a new label, Big Machine, home to Taylor Swift, after a lengthy run and messy split from Curb Records. But rather than seize an opportunity for reinvention, Mr. McGraw has continued his embrace of the neutral.“Two Lanes” is an album that’s all compromise and almost no courage, a coloring book that hasn’t been filled in. He is a star resting on what look like laurels but are actually fallacies.Sure, “Truck Yeah,” a renegade power-country number in the Kid Rock vein, is a stretch for Mr. McGraw, but he lacks the grit to pull it off. Mostly, this album is thick with pedal steel guitar and throbbing low-end bass, in stuffed-to-the-brim arrangements that suffocate the thin-voiced Mr. McGraw.The conceits are limp — “Southern Girl” and “Mexicoma” aren’t more complicated than their titles. Mr. McGraw also doesn’t have a distinctive enough voice to compensate for treacly, pat songwriting or to make it sound novel. “Highway Don’t Care,” a collaboration with Ms. Swift, has a glimmer of intensity, but just a glimmer. “Book of John” is about preserving memories in the vein of Jamey Johnson’s stark “In Color,” though Mr. McGraw’s lightweight approach only underscores the darkness that’s missing.Mr. McGraw is selling middle-class comfort alone these days. All but gone is the swaggering bravado of his youth, the stuff that kept him afloat in a cohort class of far more distinctive singers. There are a handful of invigorating songs here, ones with at least a modicum of risk, but to a one, they’re bonus tracks, as if Mr. McGraw were afraid to put them directly in the spotlight.Does he not want anyone to know that he’s capable of a deeply affecting vocal on a sad story with a happy twist, as on “Annie I Owe You a Dance”? Or that he listens to Ray Charles, as suggested by “Let Me Love It Out of You”? Or that his most natural singing voice might be directly derived from Night Ranger’s “Sister Christian,” as is clear on the stunning “Tinted Windows”? That’s where the real freedom is.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/arts/music/wayne-shorter-and-orpheus-chamber-orchestra-at-carnegie-hall.html,"The title of the latest CD by the saxophonist Wayne Shorter, which will be released on Tuesday, is “Without a Net.” It’s also an apt description for the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, which has been playing symphonic music without a conductor for 40 years. On Friday evening they joined forces at Carnegie Hall, where they performed works that Mr. Shorter wrote and arranged for jazz quartet and chamber orchestra. The result, though virtuosic in part and often riveting, somehow fell short of the sum of its parts.In the first half of the program, in works by Beethoven and Ives, the orchestra showed off its cohesive sound, which comes from a democratic rehearsal process in which each player takes responsibility for shaping the music. It was evident in the first bars of Beethoven’s Overture to “The Creatures of Prometheus,” which erupt in a sequence of chords separated by wide empty spaces: an exposed and potentially dangerous opening even with a conductor. Orpheus pulled it off with brilliance and confidence. The violins’ bow work in the following fast passage was light, crisp and joyful.Ives’s Third Symphony is a generous work of modest proportions, inclusive in its embrace of hymns, folk music and dances, yet highly idiosyncratic in how they are put together. In the hands of Orpheus each musical line seemed to take on a mind of its own. Individualism also asserted itself in the voicing of Ives’s unusual harmonies, where the inner parts asserted themselves in unexpected and revealing ways.There was not enough of such structural clarity in the second half of the concert, when the Wayne Shorter Quartet joined the orchestra at the front of the stage. Mr. Shorter, who turns 80 this year, continues to be one of the most interesting composers in jazz. His harmonies, like those of Ives, defy expectation even as they maintain a sociable approachability. In his fellow quartet members — the pianist Danilo Pérez, the bassist John Patitucci and Brian Blade on drums — Mr. Shorter has fearless improvisers and sensitive colorists.But the close harmonies that in a quartet setting create vibrant, lightly pulsating textures turned muddy in Mr. Shorter’s writing for chamber orchestra. On his CD the piece “Pegasus” is scored for quartet and wind ensemble, opening with a delicate searching motif in the piano. On Friday that motif turned heavy-footed when it was given over to trombones. In “Prometheus Unbound” the strings created a thick glaze that obscured the underlying structure. “Lotus,” which received its premiere at this concert, had moments of infectious energy, but for the most part they occurred in the cadenzas when the quartet played alone and Mr. Shorter’s sound — from stiletto sharp to velvety — came into its own."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/us/los-angeles-archdiocese-is-accused-of-failing-to-release-all-priest-abuse-records.html,"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles released 12,000 pages of internal files last Thursday on priests accused of sexually abusing children, saying that it was finally abiding by a settlement it signed with victims six years ago to make the painful history public.But it now appears that the files the church released with much fanfare are incomplete and many are unaccounted for, according to the abuse victims’ lawyers. In addition, on many documents the names of church supervisors informed of abuse allegations were redacted by the archdiocese, in apparent violation of a judge’s order. At issue is whether the survivors of abuse and the public will ever learn which church officials were responsible for mishandling or covering up allegations of sexual abuse.Abuse victims had insisted that the Archdiocese of Los Angeles release the records as part of a settlement in 2007, which provided $660 million to more than 500 victims. Other Catholic dioceses that have settled with victims have released similar records.“We know we have not gotten a complete disclosure,” said Jeff Anderson, who is among the lawyers representing the victims. “They have removed things that should not have been removed, some of which we have seen before, so we know that they exist. It’s more deception, deceit and secrecy.”But J. Michael Hennigan,  a lawyer for the Los Angeles Archdiocese, said in an interview that while there were probably a few errors, there was no intention to withhold information.“I would be surprised if we did this job perfectly,” he said. “The team that worked on this worked under pressure sometimes late into the night.”The Archdiocese of Los Angeles fought for six years all the way to the State Supreme Court to block the release of the documents. Early in January, Judge Emilie H. Elias overturned a previous decision, and ordered the archdiocese to lift the redactions of the names of certain kinds of officials: archbishops and bishops, vicars for clergy members and directors of treatment facilities, as well as pastors, “church agents” or employees who had supervisory responsibility over an accused priest and were made aware of complaints or suspicions about him.But on many pages it appears that the names of supervisors, like pastors in parishes or the supervisors of religious orders, are missing.For example, the file on Carlos Rodriguez, a priest serving in a parish in Central Los Angeles, includes a letter to him from his religious order, the Vincentian Fathers and Brothers, informing him that he is being sent to a treatment center in Maryland. Mr. Rodriguez was accused of molesting several teenage boys over the years. But while the letter makes clear that the writer is the priest’s religious superior, the name is redacted. Other documents in the file are similarly missing names of religious order supervisors. Terrence McKiernan, co-director of BishopAccountability.org, a victims’ advocacy group that collects documents on sexual abuse by clergy members, said he found many omissions by comparing the files on priests released by the Archdiocese of Los Angeles with those released by the Diocese of Orange. The Orange Diocese used to be part of the Los Angeles Archdiocese, so there is an overlap in some files.“They seem to be trying to protect the names of supervisors not only in Los Angeles, but in other dioceses as well,” Mr. McKiernan said.Even the number of pages that exist in the files is now in contention.At the hearing before Judge Elias on Jan. 7, Mr. Hennigan, the archdiocese’s lawyer, said there were 30,000 pages, arguing that it would take too long for his team to go through and remove the redactions on everything they had already redacted. “We have 30,000 pages,” he said. “Every page has to be gone through. Every redaction has to be examined afresh.”But when the church announced on Jan. 31 that it was releasing the redacted files and making them accessible through its Web site, the announcement pointed out that there were actually only 12,000 pages of files.Mr. Hennigan said the reason for the discrepancy was that the 30,000 number was a “wild guess” he had made based on how many bankers boxes of documents he had.But several lawyers for the victims said it was absurd to think that the church was so off base on the count of documents it had already redacted.Lawyers for the abuse victims said they were compiling a list of documents that they believe are missing or are erroneously redacted, and may file a motion next week to compel the church to release them."

O. Scott wrote in The Times. “Ms. Polley, rather remarkably for someone still in her 20s, shows an intuitive grasp of this wisdom and a welcome, unsentimental interest in the puzzles and pleasures of a long, imperfect marriage.” He added, “I can’t remember the last time the movies yielded up a love story so painful, so tender and so true.” In “Little Children” (2006), at 10, Kate Winslet and Patrick Wilson play Sarah Pierce and Brad Adamson, unfulfilled suburbanites who counter the boredom of their lives by embarking on an adulterous affair, in Todd Field and Tom Perrotta’s screenplay, from the novel by Mr. Perrotta. When Sarah joins a book club, it’s “Madame Bovary” that’s under discussion. Mr. Scott called the film superb, adding that Mr. Field, who also directed the work, “proves to be among the most literary of American filmmakers, one of the few who tries to find a visual language suited to the ambiguous plainness of contemporary realist fiction.” The result, he said, “is a movie that is challenging, accessible and hard to stop thinking about. At one point Brad tells Sarah that beauty is overrated, something that, as the narrator notes, only someone secure in his own beauty would say. He may nonetheless be right.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/business/global/producer-prices-fall-in-euro-zone.html,"BRUSSELS — Euro zone factory prices fell for the second month in a row in December, mirroring the trend in consumer inflation and leaving room for a possible European Central Bank interest rate cut to revive the weak economy.Prices at factory gates in the 17 countries using the euro fell 0.2 percent in December from November, the E.U.’s statistics office, Eurostat, said on Monday.Prices fell by the same margin in November. Compared to the same month a year ago, the producer price index was up 2.1 percent in December. Annual consumer inflation was 2.0 percent in January, close to the E.C.B.’s target of below 2 percent.The E.C.B.’s governing council kept rates at 0.75 percent at its January meeting and will discuss rate policy again on Thursday. The decision to keep policy on hold last month was unanimous, but economists are divided over the E.C.B.’s future moves.“The E.C.B. is unlikely to change policy stance” in February, analysts at Citigroup wrote in a note. “But we expect the tone of the press statement to turn more cautious on the economic outlook and more relaxed on the outlook for inflation,” the bank said, referring to the E.C.B.’s explanation for its decision on rates delivered to the media.Both consumer and factory inflation were driven up last year by high world oil prices and tensions between Iran and the West over Tehran’s nuclear ambitions, which further pushed up the cost of energy.Lower world oil prices have since helped cut the cost of energy for industry and households in the euro zone. Brent crude came down from $120 a barrel in August to trade around $110 a barrel towards the end of 2012.Brent crude was around $116 a barrel on Monday, on signs of improving economic growth in the United States and China.Last year’s cooler prices were reflected in the euro zone’s producer prices in December. Energy prices dropped 0.8 percent, the third straight month of decline, and by the same margin as in November."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/nyregion/first-part-of-hurricane-sandy-aid-is-to-be-released.html,"Federal officials plan on Wednesday to release the first installment of a nearly $51 billion emergency aid package to help millions of victims of Hurricane Sandy in the Northeast.That installment will total $5.4 billion, with New York City receiving $1.77 billion; New York State, $1.71 billion; New Jersey, $1.82 billion; and Connecticut, Maryland and Rhode Island splitting the rest, Senator Charles E. Schumer said.A formal announcement is tentatively scheduled for Wednesday on Staten Island, with Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg expected to be joined by Shaun Donovan, the Obama administration’s housing secretary, among others.“With this initial allocation, the work it took to pass the Sandy aid bill is starting to pay off,” Mr. Schumer, Democrat of New York, said. “We know there is desperate need and anxious waiting in the places hit by the storm. We will be making sure that this money gets to homeowners, small businesses and communities as quickly as possible.”The disbursement will come a week after Congress gave final approval to the aid package, following a heated and prolonged battle. Indeed, Mr. Donovan said in an interview that the allocation, which usually takes up to 60 days, was the fastest in history.“The president has made clear to me and all of us across the administration that we have to move as quickly as we possibly can to get these funds to families and communities that are still struggling,” he said. “But we also have to do it with great transparency and accountability.”The House had initially declined to act on the bill amid objections from fiscal conservatives over its size and its impact on the federal deficit. But Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, among others, criticized his fellow Republicans for impeding an emergency response that, in past disasters like Hurricane Katrina, had much faster federal action.In the end, Congress did pass the $51 billion package, largely along party lines, supplementing a $10 billion measure that had been approved earlier and that primarily addressed flood insurance.The money being announced on Wednesday will come in the form of Community Development Block Grants, which are the biggest component of the aid package and are intended to give localities more flexibility in allocating resources. Next to individual assistance grants from the Federal Emergency Management Agency, which are much smaller in size, these block grants are the most direct form of aid for people and businesses hurt by a natural disaster.The state and city are now drafting formal plans to be submitted in the next couple of weeks to the federal government detailing how they intend to spend the money. But the plans are likely to include awards to homeowners to repair and renovate homes and reimburse business owners who sustained heavy losses."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/media/nutrition-bars-web-series-seeks-to-debunk-diet-myths-with-a-smile.html,"IN a coming episode of “Debunking the Diet,” a new Web series produced by Luna, the nutrition bar for women, the comedian Erin Gibson quizzes women on the street about how much fiber they are supposed to have daily.“Eight,” responds one woman.“Eight what?” Ms. Gibson asks.“Eight fibers.”Later, Ms. Gibson joins Tara DelloIacono Thies, a registered dietitian and nutrition strategist for Clif Bar & Company, which owns Luna, in a studio. Along with clarifying that women require 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily and that most get only half that, Ms. DelloIacono Thies suggests good sources of fiber, like whole grains, fruits and vegetables.The Web series was created by Neighbor, an advertising and marketing agency in Santa Monica, Calif., with direction by Lauren Palmigiano and production by One Lens Media, also in Santa Monica. The first episode, which challenges the notion that eating after 8 p.m. increases the likelihood of gaining weight, was introduced on YouTube and the Luna Facebook page on Tuesday. The videos introduce a brand tagline, “Feed your strength.”Six episodes from two to three minutes will be released every two weeks, and will be advertised widely online with 30-second previews on women’s fitness and humor sites.Rosa Compean, Luna’s brand director, said the series is beginning now as an antidote to the January advertising blitz from weight loss companies.“The message is so strong in January about dieting, and the webisodes take a really lighthearted approach to tackling the diet myths and nutrition misinformation,” Ms. Compean said.Luna, which was introduced in 1999, spent only $122,000 on advertising in 2011 and $71,000 in the first nine months of 2012, according to the Kantar Media unit of WPP.Rather than advertising, the brand has directed marketing efforts primarily toward sponsorships, which enable direct interaction with consumers, and handing out samples. For instance, the brand sponsors Lunafest, a traveling women’s film festival; the Nike women’s half marathon in Washington, D.C.; and yoga and fashion events.“We realize the benefit of talking to women where they are and where they’re showing up,” Ms. Compean said. Because “Debunking the Diet” is on the Luna Facebook page and YouTube channel, where comments are encouraged, the effort is more akin to sponsoring an event than to advertising, she said.“With the rise of social media, we found a lot of great new opportunities online, and we can leverage Facebook and Twitter to have a conversation with women,” Ms. Compean said.Revenue and brand share for Luna increased every year from 2007 to 2011, according to Euromonitor International, a market research company, which has not yet compiled data for the category for 2012. In 2011, the brand earned $180.1 million in the energy and nutrition bar category, a 9.6 percent share.Nutrition bars are one of the three fastest growing foods in the country over the last decade in terms of consumption (along with yogurt and chips), according to the NPD Group, a market research company.Luna’s Web series is what marketers call branded content, meaning that it aims primarily to entertain rather than to sell products overtly. So while each episode opens and closes with the Luna logo in the credits, within the episodes the nutrition bar is featured only in passing, and in some episodes not at all.Linda Price, the president of Neighbor, the ad agency, said the videos are “more about inviting consumers in rather than pushing the brand out.”Ms. Price said the goal of having humor in the series was to “lighten up the tone of the brand,” which many may perceive positively but also view as overly earnest, and to help take the edge off the subject, because “nutrition is a topic where typically humor doesn’t play a part.”Ms. Gibson, the host, is a writer and performer for Funny or Die, a video Web site, and a co-host of Throwing Shade, a comedic podcast about women’s issues and gay issues. She said that because eating and body image can be touchy issues, she tried to put interview subjects at ease.“I’m in comedy, so my boundaries are kind of all over the place,” she said. “But you have to be careful with this stuff, and you can’t just go up to a woman and start asking her about diets.”Before they would begin filming, Ms. Gibson said, she chatted with interview subjects “to make sure that people could trust me and knew that they were in good hands and that we were just going to have a fun conversation.”Jen Drexler, a co-founder of Just Ask a Woman, a company that specializes in marketing to women, said that Luna has earned a reputation as a grass-roots brand, one that “a lot of women are attracted to because it supports their local race or a goody bag came from Luna.”As for the series, Ms. Drexler, who is a vice president at Insight Strategy Group, said she thought introducing it in February made sense.“I love the timing because it lets people get the silliness out of their systems from their New Year’s resolutions,” she said after watching several episodes. “When you fall off the resolution wagon, this is that brand for when you’re ready to face facts and do things realistically.”In future iterations of the series, she recommended that Luna scrutinize popular exercise regimens, like the P90X workout, and exercise gear.“I could see Luna being sort of an authentic truth teller in that space,” she said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/arts/music/reg-presley-lead-singer-of-troggs-dies-at-71.html,"Reg Presley, a bricklayer-turned-singer whose ebulliently lusty vocal on the Troggs’ smash hit “Wild Thing” helped elevate the song to rock ’n’ roll legend, died on Monday at his home in Andover, England. He was 71.His agent, Keith Altham, said Mr. Presley, who had lung cancer, died after a series of strokes.“Wild thing, you make my heart sing,” Mr. Presley rasped in a voice that spoke as much as sang as the song grew more suggestive:Wild thing, I think you move meBut I wanna know for sure.So come on and hold me tight.(Pause) You move me.A paean to teenage lust, the recording sold five million copies for the Troggs after its release in 1966 and inspired the coming wave of heavy metal and punk rockers with its straight-ahead three-chord simplicity. The lead guitar lines have provided inspiration for artists from Jimi Hendrix to Bruce Springsteen to garage bands everywhere.It was the song’s sheer sensuality, propelled by Mr. Presley’s growl, that stirred listeners. John Rockwell of The New York Times wrote in 1975 that the Troggs, whom he characterized as “cave-man primitive,” were “everything mothers feared their darlings would fall for or turn into.”“Wild Thing” reached No. 1 in the United States, the only time this would happen for the Troggs. (It got as high as No. 2 in Britain.) Rolling Stone ranked their rendition of the song, written by Chip Taylor, 261st on its list of the 500 greatest songs.The group’s success in the United States was limited by a dispute between record companies over rights, and by the fact that the band did not do an American tour early on. In Britain, they had hits with “With a Girl Like You” (No. 1) and “I Can’t Control Myself” (No. 2), both in 1966. Their “Love Is All Around” was No. 5 in Britain in 1967 and No. 7 in the United States in 1968. Mr. Presley wrote all three.An argument the group had in the studio in 1968 over how to approach a song was secretly recorded and leaked to the music underground, which loved it — partly for its effusive profanity and partly for a band member’s lyrical insistence that only a sprinkling of “fairy dust” made hits. The tape was included in the group’s 1992 compilation album, “Archaeology (1967-1977).”The Troggs attracted new attention in 1994, when the Scottish band Wet Wet Wet recorded “Love Is All Around.” That version topped the British singles chart and appeared in the movie “Four Weddings and a Funeral.”Reginald Maurice Ball was born on June 12, 1941, in Andover. His father drove first milk trucks and then buses, and his mother ran a cafe. He left school at 15 to work as bricklayer. He met a young woman named Brenda at a dance when he was 20 and asked her to marry him. She did, 18 months later. She survives him, as do their children, Karen and Jason.His start in music was inauspicious, as he quickly discovered he could not play guitar. His family went on welfare as his group, originally called the Troglodytes, scrambled for work. His manager changed his last name to Presley, but forgot to tell him. He found out by reading a magazine.Mr. Presley was fascinated by extraterrestrial phenomena like flying saucers and crop circles and wrote a book about them. He claimed to have personally seen 14 U.F.O.’s, though he acknowledged that some of his sightings were “iffy.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/arts/music/q-and-a-chris-potter-on-the-sirens.html,"Since recording his first album just over 20 years ago, Chris Potter has earned his stature as the most commandingly skilled saxophonist of his generation, an improviser of deft insight and athletic poise. His high profile as a sideman — in the studio with Steely Dan, and in bands led by the drummer Paul Motian, the bassist Dave Holland and, most recently, the guitarist Pat Metheny — has sometimes overshadowed his output as a bandleader.His flagship over much of the last decade has been Underground, a band defined by its rough embrace of rock and funk. Mr. Potter preserves that band’s attunement to texture but adheres to an acoustic palette on “The Sirens” (ECM), his finest effort yet. The album features Craig Taborn, of Underground, on piano; David Virelles on celeste, harmonium and prepared piano; Larry Grenadier on bass; and Eric Harland on drums. (Mr. Potter will be at the Village Vanguard through Sunday with similar personnel, though Ethan Iverson is the pianist, trying to fill two sets of shoes.)“The Sirens” draws inspiration from “The Odyssey,” the ancient Greek epic poem of exile, homecoming and the treacherous path in between. Last month, on the eve of his own epic journey — a 40-city North American itinerary with the Monterey Jazz Festival on Tour — Mr. Potter discussed “The Sirens” and its connection to Homer’s ancient work at Kefi, a Greek restaurant on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. The first item ordered was naturally Mythos Hellenic Lager Beer. Here are excerpts from that conversation.Q. What drew you to “The Odyssey”?A. I read it in high school and thought it was cool but didn’t go much further than that. When I reread it, I was really taken with the beauty of it and how many of the themes in the book resonate. It’s good and evil, these big decisions — and a lot of stuff about interpersonal relationships, which is rare for an ancient text, I think. It’s very psychological, in a way. I really didn’t have any intention of writing music about “The Odyssey.” I had a musical sound that I wanted to get to: I knew I wanted it to be this acoustic thing, I knew I wanted it to be kind of spacious. And the mood of the book, this out-of-time feeling, really fit in with what I was looking for.Q. One translator of “The Odyssey,” Robert Fagles, observed that “Homer’s work is a performance, even in part a musical event.”A. It doesn’t feel like a novel — like “art,” in the sense of someone observing the world and commenting on it. It feels a little more archetypal than that. It feels created by more than one person, in a certain way.Q. Did the music of the text have any influence on your compositions? Obviously we’re coming at it from a remove: the original meter is dactylic hexameter, and English translations tend to use iambic pentameter.A. I didn’t really think so much about the rhythm of the poem. For one thing, as you said, it’s very far removed from what the original was. But the kind of language, and this idea of a mythic time and space, was definitely an influence. Also this poetic world, very far removed from the modern, urban world.Q. Odysseus is a figure who yearns for home and is buffeted by many forces. Do you relate to that?A. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It’s hard for me to even imagine having a different life. As universal as the themes in “The Odyssey” are, there might be some that personally resonate more with me: leaving, and not knowing exactly how it’s going to go, or who you’re going to run into, or what problems are going to arise. Just that being-away-from-home thing, and returning home.Q. And as a touring musician, you’re often putting yourself at the mercy of your hosts. There’s so much in this story about hospitality and codes of etiquette.A. The whole book is very social. Nothing is in a vacuum at all. And yes, I can definitely vouch for the fact that when a promoter goes out of their way to take the musicians out to a nice dinner, you’re going to have a happier band.Q. There’s a lot of opportunity with “The Odyssey” to write material inspired by monstrosity, whether it’s Scylla and Charybdis or the Cyclops. But you chose to focus on either the more sublime or lovelier aspects of the tale. Can you explain that?A. A lot of what’s interesting to me is how Odysseus actually interacts with people. He’s in these situations where he has to represent himself. That to me is a big reason why it feels so contemporary. A couple of the tunes that are about women — “Penelope” and “Nausikaa” — are played on soprano saxophone. In a way that’s them speaking in their voice. It works also because most of the album is on tenor, which is a lower, more male voice: Odysseus. That wasn’t all that conscious, but a little bit.Q. And yet the call of the Sirens in the text is described as a “high, thrilling song.” You chose to play that song, the album’s title track, on bass clarinet.A. I was originally trying to play that song on alto flute, actually. It would have been a little lighter. But when we tried it in the studio, bass clarinet was what seemed to work. It’s this singsongy, slightly Gregorian, ancient-sounding melody. The way that I was thinking about it was as an abstract idea about something that seems nice and light and attractive and draws you in — and takes you away from your path. And how dangerous that really is.Q. Has there been something like that in your experience?A. I’ve been lucky to avoid it. But I have that in my personality, I think. For me, with the kind of good fortune that I’ve had to have worked with so many people, there’s been a danger of forgetting what it was that I actually wanted to do as a leader. It would be easy to never deal with that, and just keep working.Q. We’ve established that you identify with the travel-weary aspects of Odysseus’ tale. He’s also painted as a storyteller: a master of cunning and thinking on his feet.A. Yeah, an improviser. Definitely.Q. So that must be another attribute you also identify with.A. I don’t know if I’m on that level. But yeah, that is kind of the gig, to think on your feet. All the time too. Obviously when you’re onstage, but even when you’re not. That seems to be a thing about great jazz musicians, is that whatever they’re doing, they’re dealing with it in that improvisational kind of way. And maybe that’s what makes the music so compelling, that it demonstrates a way of life."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/business/media/scientology-runs-super-bowl-ad.html,"After several months of mounting accusations over the treatment of its members, the Church of Scientology on Sunday tried to spread a softer, gentler message using the biggest advertising event in the country: the Super Bowl.For the first time, the church bought commercial time in local markets during the Super Bowl in order to feature an ad that called on “the curious, the inquisitive, the seekers of knowledge.” The ad, which ran in cities including New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco and Dallas, was in stark contrast to the more traditional Super Bowl fare from brands like Budweiser, Mercedes-Benz and Coca-Cola.“Some will doubt you,” said the narrator in the ad over soft-focus images of mostly young, ethnically diverse strivers. “Let them. Dare to think for yourself, to look for yourself, to make up your own mind.”Robert Passikoff, the president of Brand Keys in New York, a brand and customer-loyalty consulting company, said he was surprised to see the ad during the game. “Clearly the organization was looking for as broad an audience as it could,” he said.Called “Knowledge,” the ad was produced by Golden Era Productions, the Church of Scientology International’s own studio, which creates training films and other video content for the church, Karin Pouw, a spokeswoman for the organization said in an e-mail.The ad itself was not new; a longer version ran on the organization’s Web site in November. Ms. Pouw said the ad “would appear on prominent Web sites and air during prime time TV programs over the next several months,” and was shown 16 times an hour on a digital billboard in Times Square in December.“We are thrilled with the response to this advertisement and that so many millions of people were able to see our message,” Ms. Pouw said.The campaign came after several well-publicized attacks on the church’s credibility. In October, Vanity Fair published an article detailing the actress Katie Holmes’s life in Scientology during her marriage to the church’s most visible member, Tom Cruise. In January, Lawrence Wright published his investigative book, “Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood & the Prison of Belief,” which takes direct aim at the church’s practices and its founder, L. Ron Hubbard.Ms. Pouw said the ads were not a direct response to Mr. Wright’s book.“There has always been a demand for information about Scientology, and the ads are part of a longer term effort to meet that demand,” she said in the e-mail. “We have been running it online for some time and are expanding onto television.”Jeff Sharlet, an assistant professor of English at Dartmouth College who has written about religion and the news media, said the ads were an attempt to position the church as nonconformist and appealing.“It’s what marginal religions are doing more than evangelizing,” Mr. Sharlet said. “They are trying to say ‘You can trust us.’ ” Calling the ad “sort of mushy and vague,” he compared it to a sentimental commercial from the Chrysler Group extolling the virtues of farmers that also ran during the Super Bowl. Ad agency executives estimated the cost of this year’s Super Bowl commercials at $3.7 million to $3.8 million for 30 seconds.Rohit Deshpande, a professor of marketing at Harvard Business School, said that the ad was trying to be inspirational while saying very little about the organization itself. “The motivation is maybe to get some positive association and to build some curiosity so people will follow up and learn more about what the organization is about,” he said.Scientology has never shied away from promotions. Subway posters and sidewalk invitations to personality testing have long been familiar to those living in New York and other cities around the country. One of the church’s highly visible buildings in Hollywood is approached by a public street named for its founder.In December, the church used the Universal Studios back lot for its annual antidrug footrace and pancake breakfast. About 3,000 athletes participated, it said.The church has often been accused of being relentless in its treatment of critics, but its leaders seem to have taken a more measured approach recently. When the Weinstein Company last year released “The Master,” a film about the founding of a fictional cult that had clear parallels to Scientology, the church largely ignored it. The movie made little impression at the box office, despite critical acclaim and Oscar nominations for three of its actors.But the church has recently released another ad, this one about Mr. Hubbard himself, which begins by calling him “the nation’s youngest Eagle Scout” and ends by calling him “the most published and translated author of all time” and the founder of Scientology. The ad will run in “major metropolitan markets across the country,” including New York, Ms. Pouw said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/arts/television/netflixs-house-of-cards-redefines-the-spoiler-alert.html,"This article about “House of Cards” contains no spoilers.That notice seems necessary, since Netflix’s all-at-once release of the Kevin Spacey political thriller series last Friday has raised a thicket of questions. Chief among them: how can viewers who binged on all 13 episodes in one sitting talk about the show without ruining the season for others who might wait weeks or months to watch it?Netflix’s release strategy went against the grain of “social TV,” the catchall term for viewers who virtually watch TV together by chatting along in real time on Twitter, Facebook and other Web sites. Jenni Konner, one of the showrunners for HBO’s “Girls,” made the point this way on Twitter on Sunday night: “I don’t know how to talk to people who aren’t at least halfway through ‘House of Cards.’ ” On Tuesday she still had one episode left.Dave Winer, the Internet pioneer who helped give birth to blogging in the late 1990s, restarted his Netflix subscription so he could watch the series, and immediately noticed the drawback to the all-at-once approach.“I don’t want spoilers, and I don’t want to be a spoiler,” he wrote in a blog post on Sunday. “We need to invent new communication systems, where only people who have made it through Episode X can discuss with others who have made it exactly that far.”These are the conundrums that accompany the decades-long shift from “appointment viewing” to the on-demand kind — and they’re heightened by Netflix, which is plowing new ground by trying to make network-quality programming exclusively for the Web.Netflix says it won’t release any data about how many of its 27 million streaming subscribers in this country watch “House of Cards,” much to the exasperation of broadcast and cable television executives, who suspect that the show would be relatively low-rated if Nielsen were actually tracking it. But Nielsen is not, partly because Netflix has no advertising. The industry will know if the show is a success only if Netflix orders more episodes.For now, Netflix is committed to 26 episodes; filming will begin on the second half in the spring. The company declined interview requests about the response to “House of Cards” this week, but a spokesman said in a statement, “We’re happy with the great reception the show has had in the media, social media and the reviews on Netflix.com.”The commotion about online release strategies (and spoiler avoidance) isn’t going away. Netflix has more original shows in production — a new season of “Arrested Development” is due in May, for example — and competitors like Hulu do too. Amazon is financing half a dozen comedy pilots with actors like Jeffrey Tambor and John Goodman. A production company called Prospect Park is bringing back the soap operas “One Life to Live” and “All My Children” online, to be shown on Hulu and elsewhere.While appointment viewing still accounts for a vast majority of Americans’ TV time, these shows will exist as a lab experiment of sorts, allowing companies to try — and to study — new viewing behaviors. “Over the next several years, speculation will give way to data,” the “House of Cards” showrunner, Beau Willimon, wrote on Twitter.Mr. Willimon was active on Twitter all weekend, answering questions and asking binge viewers to prove that they were watching. To one viewer who lost sleep watching all the episodes in a row, he wrote, “Anyone who gets fired for missing work due to ‘House of Cards’... I will personally pay for their Netflix subscription.”His involvement might be one way to create “social TV” chatter. Networks like HBO and ABC say online conversations about once-a-week shows can double as free marketing, sometimes bolstering ratings. But Netflix has other ways to market, like its home page, which can be a huge billboard for shows.“The huge benefit is that we don’t have to advertise ‘8 p.m. on a Thursday night, tune in,’ ” Netflix’s chief executive, Reed Hastings, told investors last week. “We get to let people know about the show, and they can watch it any time, at their leisure.”The investors didn’t ask Mr. Hastings about the social conundrum the show’s release created. On Friday “House of Cards” would have ranked No. 6 on the daily chart of most-talked-about TV shows assembled by Trendrr, a company that specializes in such data. By Sunday, though, Trendrr said, it would have fallen out of the Top 10. (The show didn’t appear on the charts because Trendrr tracks only broadcast and cable telecasts.)By Monday, reviews — largely positive — of the entire first season were trickling in. Some writers said they loved the season but hated the glut. “Art, after all, is meant to be contemplated; junk food is meant to be consumed quickly, without thought or sentiment,” wrote Jace Lacob in The Daily Beast. “Is ‘House of Cards’ doing itself a disservice by urging viewers to watch so quickly? Should we be approaching television as one would a bag of potato chips? Is there something to be said for waiting patiently until the next meal?”There is, but Netflix is arguing that viewers should have the option to watch as they wish, one at a time or all at once. Over the weekend some “House of Cards” viewers started their Twitter and Facebook posts with the episode number, as in, “I’m on No. 5.” Some said they would watch two or three each weekend until the season finale, and avoid spoilers in the meantime.By Tuesday, the Internet was lighting up with “safe spaces” for faster viewers to converse about all 13 episodes. “If You’ve Seen All of House of Cards, Let’s Discuss,” read a blog post on New York magazine’s entertainment site Vulture.That’s a long way from Mr. Winer’s proposal for a new communication system, but it’s a start."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/hockey/new-season-but-martin-brodeur-and-adam-henrique-lead-devils-again.html,"NEWARK — The Devils-Rangers rivalry picked up where it left off last spring during the Stanley Cup playoffs, with fans at sold-out Prudential Center chanting the names of Martin Brodeur and Adam Henrique.Henrique scored the overtime goal in Game 6 that eliminated the Rangers from the Eastern Conference finals last May 25, and he scored the first goal Tuesday — five minutes in — as the Devils tormented the Rangers anew, 3-1.“Obviously, it was a huge goal last year, one that I’ll never forget — and I’m sure you guys will bring it up plenty of times when we play the Rangers,” Henrique said. “But at this point, last year is last year. It’s a shortened season and these are huge, 4-point games.”The surging Devils are just 1 point behind the Eastern Conference-leading Penguins. The sputtering Rangers are tied for 10th place.Henrique’s linemate David Clarkson scored the Devils’ last two goals, boosting his total to seven in just nine games, and had an assist. The other winger on that line, Patrik Elias, had three assists.Brodeur, who outperformed Henrik Lundqvist in that playoff win, did it again, turning aside 24 of 25 shots.Rangers forward Rick Nash missed a couple of good scoring chances. In the first period, he barreled into Brodeur as the puck slowly slid toward the goal line, but Nash dislodged the net before the puck crossed the line.In the first minute of the second period, Nash stole the puck from Elias, stickhandled around Brodeur and stood within a foot of an empty net. But he released the puck as he pivoted, gently steering it parallel to the goal line along the entire length of the crease, and it skidded harmlessly away.Nash’s misfortune was compounded on the Devils’ second goal, when he lost the puck in his skates in front of Lundqvist. Clarkson pounced on it for his sixth goal at 19 minutes 7 seconds.Clarkson scored again, swatting in a rebound on a power play at 17:07 of the third period.The lone bright spots for the Rangers were the play of J. T. Miller, their first-round draft choice in 2011, who made his N.H.L. debut after being called up Monday from the club’s American Hockey League affiliate in Connecticut, and Chris Kreider, the rookie who had missed five straight games because of benching and injury.Kreider scored at 6:20 of the third period to make the score 3-1. It was the first regular-season goal of his N.H.L. career. Last spring, Kreider made his professional debut in the playoffs and scored five goals, three in the series against the Devils.After the game, Coach John Tortorella praised Kreider and Miller and issued a warning to the rest of his players.“They’re probably going to take some people’s jobs,” he said. “We have some guys on our hockey club that are really playing hard, and we have some guys that look scared to me, and tentative. I’m very happy with Kreider. I thought he played well. I thought Miller was hard on the puck, did some really good things.“We’ll see where we go with our lineup,” Tortorella said. “I’ll tell you right now we’re not waiting. We have some guys that are very tentative, very careful, and we don’t play careful hockey.”Miller played with poise, logging 14:25 of ice time, 4:35 on the power play, as his girlfriend, parents and various family members looked on, having traveled from Ohio, Michigan and western Pennsylvania on short notice to attend. He got off two shots and was part of an extended series of passes that ended with Marc Staal being robbed at the doorstep by Brodeur.But the Rangers’ power play went 0 for 5, with just three shots on goal.“I’m excited, anxious — I’ve been looking forward to this since I was a little kid,” Miller, a 6-foot-1 forward who can play center and wing, said before the game.Miller was performing on a big stage only a month ago. He tied for the team scoring lead as the United States won the world junior tournament in Russia.“I’ll try to treat this like the gold medal game, with the excitement,” Miller said.Miller will probably stay with the Rangers until Ryan Callahan returns from his shoulder injury, no more than five games.“We talked about how motivated the other side would be today,” Devils Coach Peter DeBoer said. “It’s a tough summer when you go home and you don’t win.”The Rangers will probably have a tough practice Wednesday.SLAP SHOTSDefenseman Dan Girardi was a surprise scratch, only the third game he has missed in his seven-season N.H.L. career. Rangers officials said he was “banged up.” Girardi did not practice Monday in what John Tortorella called a “maintenance day.” He took the morning skate and did not mention to reporters that he would miss the game, which snapped his consecutive-games streak at 120. ... Girardi’s usual partner in the top defense pairing, Ryan McDonagh, played alongside Anton Stralman."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/sports/olympics/nbcs-2014-olympic-broadcasts-to-begin-a-day-early.html,"NBC Universal’s love of the Olympics is well known. It has carried all the Winter and Summer Games since 2000.In 2011, it agreed to pay $4.38 billion to show the four Olympics from 2014 to 2020.And on Tuesday, the network said it would begin its Winter Olympics broadcast next February a day before the opening ceremony, with a prime-time broadcast from Sochi, Russia, that will feature two new events — team figure skating and slopestyle snowboarding — as well as women’s freestyle moguls.NBC said it would be the first time a broadcaster in the United States had started its prime-time programming ahead of the opening ceremony.“It’s a great way to jump-start the Olympics,” Mark Lazarus, chairman of the NBC Sports Group, said during a news conference.The opportunity to add the extra night on Thursday, Feb. 6, was made possible with the International Olympic Committee’s addition of 12 events to the Winter Games program, which prompts an 18th day of competition.Lazarus said that the network’s rating and viewership for the added night would not be included in its cumulative 17-night performance, in part because there were no comparisons to past Olympics. It is possible that Olympic programming the night before the opening ceremony will draw a favorable rating. But if it is disappointing, NBC will not have to add it to its overall rating.All the sports events from Sochi will be shown live at NBCOlympics.com, and more than half the events, including every United States hockey game and curling match, will be shown live somewhere amid NBC’s cluster of broadcast and cable networks.But the nine-hour time difference between Sochi and the United States’ Eastern time zone means that the prime-time broadcasts will be shown on a delay.One result of NBC’s research from the 2012 London Summer Games was that carrying Olympic events live digitally helped to build, rather than to diminish, the prime-time audience even if viewers had already watched the contests on computers, smartphones or tablets.“The more content out there, the more prime-time viewing,” said Gary Zenkel, president of NBC Olympics.Lazarus said that he was hopeful that the N.H.L., whose games are carried by NBC, would agree to send its players to Sochi.“They’re a global league with many players from Russia,” he said, “and they have a TV partner that knows how to manage their product.”Lazarus said he expected NBC to make a profit at the Sochi Games. NBC earned a small profit from the London Olympics after early predictions of a loss as high as $200 million."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/06/arts/music/music-of-now-marathon-begins-composers-now-series.html,"No concert, however epic in duration, could encompass the entirety of the contemporary classical world, which has grown too broad and variegated to sample in one sitting. But as a microcosm of the teeming activity that falls under the broad umbrella of the new-music rubric, the Music of Now Marathon, a recently instituted annual event at Symphony Space, does nicely. Programmed by Laura Kaminsky, a composer and Symphony Space’s artistic director, the marathon is the opening event in Composers Now, a monthlong series organized by Tania León, which includes dozens of concerts throughout the city.Just what criteria were used to select and order the composers and artists who appeared in Music of Now, held on Saturday afternoon and evening, went unrevealed. What was offered was a friendly succession of interviews, in which Ms. Kaminsky and Ms. León asked composers about their methods and motivations, followed by performances: Query, play, repeat.If the marathon made no sweeping statements about the general trajectory of modern music, the opening work, Libby Larsen’s 1991 string quartet, “Schoenberg, Schenker, Schillinger,” offered one pertinent view. Its three movements evoke three foundational concepts of 20th-century music: Arnold Schoenberg’s revolutionary 12-tone technique; Heinrich Schenker’s essentialist approach to harmonic analysis; and Joseph Schillinger’s math-based methodology.The sequence, Ms. Larsen explained onstage, illustrates her belief that a shift in focus from melody toward rhythm has been central to the way music is perceived now. Played by the Cassatt Quartet, the coolly meandering “Schoenberg” movement had an ineffable melancholy; the concluding “Schillinger” section, a cheery vitality.Heedless of manifestoes, the concert wound through straightforward melodicism and rhythmic buoyancy in Octavio Vazquez’s Trio for Oboe, Bassoon and Piano, given its premiere by the Poulenc Trio; a subtle weaving of individual and collective strands in Anna Weesner’s work “The Space Between,” played by the Cassatt Quartet; a haunting distillation of drama without words in Susan Botti’s “Gates of Silence,” performed by Ensemble Pi; and Errollyn Wallen’s playfully eclectic, pop-savvy songs and piano works, which she presented with exuberance and wit.The most striking part of the five-hour stretch I attended came during a segment featuring Angélica Negrón, a gifted young composer born in Puerto Rico and living in Brooklyn. She offered two dreamy pieces, “Cosmovisión” and “El Reloj,” with a trio that combined her voice, accordion and musical toys with Nuiko Wadden’s harp and Shayna Dunkelman’s xylosynth, a sampling keyboard played with mallets.Ms. Negrón, born in 1981, comes from a generation of composers for whom engagement with pop music extends past familiarity to hands-on facility — she also plays and sings in an electro-pop band, Balún. The two wistful confections she presented here would have been equally at home in a downtown nightclub or a Brooklyn loft space.Immediately after, the pianist Ursula Oppens played what could have been the antithesis of Ms. Negrón’s music: “Memo 5,” by Bernard Rands, a distinguished composer born in England in 1934, who studied with Berio, Boulez and Maderna.Written in 1975 — the year Mr. Rands relocated to America — this nine-minute piece represents a formidable strain of high modernism, expressed in leaping intervals and tumultuous rhythmic bursts. Exulting in sheer technique, the rigorously wrought music sounded positively spontaneous, as amiable and inviting in its way as Ms. Negrón’s had been.Even with so much promiscuous eclecticism on display, two segments of the concert stood out. Martha Mooke, using electric violas and effects pedals, bridged the gap between Romantic virtuoso composer-performers like Paganini and Liszt and MIDI-friendly successors like Todd Reynolds and Zoe Keating.And the Nouveau Classical Project incorporated fashion into its aesthetic, accessorizing a dramatic severity in handsome works by Polina Nazaykinskaya and Huck Hodge with attire designed by Jenny Lai, emphasizing heavy textures, angular forms and a somber palette."

Kristin Scott Thomas is Katharine Clifton, the elegant Englishwoman whom Almasy pursued with fierce intensity before being literally consumed by fire. “Swoon,” he whispers to her. “I’ll catch you.” She does. And Colin Firth is her husband, Geoffrey Clifton, a British intelligence agent. “She was always crying on my shoulder for somebody,” he says. “Finally persuaded her to settle for my shoulder. Stroke of genius.” Writing in The Times, Janet Maslin called the film, which won nine Oscars, “a stunning feat of literary adaptation as well as a purely cinematic triumph.”10 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/movies/awardsseason/steven-spielbergs-team-lincoln-is-in-oscar-forefront.html,"BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. — If there were an oral history of the making of “Lincoln,” it might start with a 6-year-old Steven Spielberg visiting the Lincoln Memorial in Washington one winter. “I was freezing my little tush off, and my uncle brought me to meet this giant,” he recalled in an interview here on Monday. “I had no idea who he was except he was bigger than me and really intimidating.”The young Steven was so scared he didn’t want to look the statue in the eyes. “Then, just before I left, I dared myself to look up into his face and suddenly felt like we were in some way related,” he said. “It was a very familiar feeling, a very warm feeling, and I felt very safe and protected just at a glance.”“That,” he added, “was an image never forgotten.”Cut from this moment, with its childhood expression of timeless wonder (a stare that has come to be known, in movie-geek circles, as the Spielberg Face), to a set in Richmond, Va., nearly 60 years later, where hundreds of artisans, technicians and performers are laboring to get the last few months of Abraham Lincoln’s life on screen. The mood, many said, was reverential: Daniel Day-Lewis, as Lincoln, was called the president even when he wasn’t in front of the camera, and when radios crackled with word that he was entering a scene, the set went quiet.“It had this sacred quality,” Joanna Johnston, the film’s costume designer, said.“Lincoln” leads the Oscars with a dozen nominations — spread among many who are already nominees and winners many times over — but it was a bear to make, even for professionals at the top of their field. It had been decades, Mr. Spielberg said, since Lincoln’s story was dramatized on the big screen, a gap he found daunting.“Are wiser, more sage minds or filmmakers telling me that he’s unattainable?” Mr. Spielberg said he asked himself. But his schoolboy fascination — he studied encyclopedia entries about Lincoln (“Popular? No, I wasn’t,” he said) — drove him on.“I was interested in somebody that looked so awkward and looked so uncomfortable in his skin, could have done the things he did,” Mr. Spielberg said. “The most compelling thing, growing up reading about Lincoln, was that he seemed to be more a man of the people than most presidents are given credit for.” Constituents took their problems directly to him, he said, “and the fact that he actually listened to them was provocative and kind of stirring to me.”Still, the movie took more than 12 years to come together. It started with a chance conversation between Mr. Spielberg and the historian Doris Kearns Goodwin before a millennium celebration in Washington. Mr. Spielberg bought the rights to her book “Team of Rivals” even before she wrote it, and she sent him a chapter at a time.Early scripts encompassed all four years of the Lincoln presidency as well as big battle scenes, and, with Liam Neeson screen-testing as Lincoln, the production had a stylized visual feel.It was “much more about Lincoln’s premonitions and dreams,” Janusz Kaminski, the cinematographer, said. When Tony Kushner signed on to adapt the screenplay, tied to the passing of the 13th Amendment abolishing slavery, the details of Lincoln’s life came into focus, Mr. Kaminski said.“We see him not just as a leader of the nation and a man who changed the world forever, but also a father, as a husband, as a man who has to deal with a wife who is obviously a little bit mentally disturbed, with the loss of his child,” he added. “So you have a chance to see this icon as a regular guy.”Mr. Kaminski, an Oscar winner for “Saving Private Ryan” and “Schindler’s List,” is one of the many veteran Spielbergians who worked on the film, allowing for a cinematic shorthand.“It’s very much an instinctive process,” Rick Carter, the production designer, said.John Williams, the composer — and with 48 nominations, the second-most recognized person in Oscar history, after Walt Disney — created a score that he viewed as an accompaniment not to the visuals or emotions on screen but to Mr. Kushner’s dense script. “Principally our role was to try to find textures and tempos that were suitable to the pace of the dialogue,” he said. The soundtrack, performed by the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, which Mr. Williams conducted, is quieter and less dramatic than most of his film compositions (“Star Wars,” “Jaws”).Michael Kahn has been Mr. Spielberg’s editor since “Close Encounters of the Third Kind,” filmed in 1976. They edit as they go, looking at footage a day or two after they shoot it. Mr. Spielberg spent more time in the editing room for “Lincoln” than for previous projects, Mr. Kahn said.They lingered on the actors’ glances. “Steven and I have done so many action pictures, but this was different,” Mr. Kahn said. “This is a good dialogue picture. And what Lincoln said is so important and so historical, and so we were leisurely. We stayed with people and let them talk things out.”Mr. Kahn, who attended Abraham Lincoln High School in Coney Island (“I was meant to be on this show,” he said, his Brooklyn accent intact), was sanguine about criticisms of the movie. “I’ve been on so many movies where they’ve always said it’s too long; you have one ending, you have two endings, you got four endings, and yet we’ve done well,” he said. “If they like the show, they’ll like a couple of minutes more.”Mr. Spielberg added that individual scenes in “Lincoln” were some of the lengthiest of his career. “I wanted the audience to feel like they were eavesdropping on these moments in history,” he said.For the production artists the film was an opportunity to delve into period research. The sound designer, Ben Burtt, sent someone to the Kentucky Historical Society to record the ticking of Lincoln’s pocket watch.Ms. Johnston, who worked on “Forrest Gump” and “Saving Private Ryan,” would not allow even unseen anachronisms, like plastic buttons, though she had to dress her largest cast yet, 140 speaking characters, as well as extras. The president’s wardrobe, she noted, was not lavish. For Mr. Day-Lewis she made just two stovepipe hats, and he wore only a few jackets. “Daniel as well was very keen on the idea that we wouldn’t have loads of changes,” she said. “You had a coat, you wore it, it wore out and you’d get another coat.”Mr. Kaminski, mindful that 19th-century lighting came from candles, gas lamps and windows, staged action near those, and went long on the shadows. He did take some liberties. If he were completely faithful to the period “you would not be able to see anything,” he said.Mr. Carter, the production designer, silk-screened wallpaper and matched historic White House rugs.He was inspired by a trip to the White House in 2003, when he visited the Lincoln Bedroom, originally Lincoln’s office, and walked the hallways. That space, he said, felt haunted — “not a dark or negative haunting, but the burden that was carried by Lincoln in his time.”“From the very beginning we knew this would be a psychological space,” Mr. Carter added.Mr. Spielberg has spent a night in the Lincoln Bedroom, where a copy of the Emancipation Proclamation is kept. He has been Oscar nominated a half-dozen times for directing, but he has won only for “Schindler’s List” and “Saving Private Ryan.” He feels a need, he said, to make historically based films.“I think I do have a responsibility,” he said, “as a kind of countermeasure to being able to also tell stories that couldn’t possibly happen.”And he learned more while making “Lincoln” than while working on any other movie, he said. “Special effects, high-genre concepts, big set pieces, eventizing history has been what I’ve been doing with both my imagination and on films that are based on historical fact,” he said. “But I’ve never before made a film without all of those nets for me to fall into. I’ve never made a film where this was going to succeed or fail based on the writing and based on the performances.”That, he added, “is one of the scariest things I’ve ever gone into.”Especially since, in this case, he felt the extra weight of Lincoln’s legacy. “Maybe this is the quietest directing I’ve done in my life,” Mr. Spielberg said."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/business/smallbusiness/wiped-out-by-sandy-an-owner-sizes-up-the-risk-in-starting-over.html,"The Automobile Film Club of America has played a supporting role in New York-based film and television productions since 1993. It owns a fleet of vehicles — including police cruisers, taxis and vintage automobiles — that have squired stars and models in advertising shoots, TV shows and action films, including two Spider-Man movies and two “Men in Black” films. Woody Allen rented a 1964 Porsche Cabriolet for one movie and bought an Aston Martin that was totaled in another. “When they crash something, they buy it,” said Ralph Lucci, the owner.THE CHALLENGE Deciding whether Mr. Lucci, 60, should put his house up as collateral to get a Small Business Administration loan in an attempt to revive his business, which is based in Stapleton, on Staten Island, half a block from the waterfront. In October, Hurricane Sandy’s surge swamped the company’s 6,000-square-foot lot and garage, submerging 57 cars in salt water. (Three vehicles that were on garage lifts avoided damage.) Lost were an ambulance worth $20,000, taxi cabs that cost more than $5,000 and a police crime scene unit vehicle valued at more than $16,000.“I have mechanics, they all say they’re totally junk,” Mr. Lucci said. “It took five hours to destroy the business.”After the storm, he spent weeks trying to start cars and ripping out rotting plaster board from his office. The $25,000 tow truck turns over but keeps slipping out of gear. He figures it will cost $400,000 to replace the cars and refurbish the office, the shop and the equipment. Unfortunately, the cars were insured only for liability — adequate, he thought, for transporting cars from Point A to Point B. (Once they are on a movie set, his vehicles are insured by the production.)THE BACKGROUND Mr. Lucci began supplying cars to the movie industry in 1975. Lucci Auto Props, a business he owned with his brother, was based in Red Hook, Brooklyn. After the two had a falling out, Mr. Lucci said, he walked away from the company and opened a shop that sold exotic cars. In the late ’80s, he took a sales job with a luxury carmaker.But he never lost interest in the movie business. In 1993, he opened Automobile Film Club, using a lot from the city’s Economic Development Corporation. Mr. Lucci said he worked hard to get production companies the exact vehicles they wanted and stayed on set to make sure everything worked.Over time, his business grew to 350 cars and 14 full-time employees, mostly secretaries and mechanics. The company survived the long drought after 9/11, when the mayor’s office stopped issuing film permits. Mr. Lucci said a $45,000 S.B.A. loan helped him get by and has been paid back. In 2008, his best year, the business grossed $1.8 million.The next year, his contract for the lot ended. Unable to find a large, affordable parcel for his fleet, Mr. Lucci downsized, buying one 10,000-square-foot lot and renting another. He sold hundreds of cars. The payroll dwindled to him and his wife.During Hurricane Irene in 2011, Mr. Lucci said, 30 of his cars were damaged. Because he was carrying only liability insurance on his vehicles, he could not claim damages. The S.B.A. offered him a $6,000 loan at 4 percent interest. He thought the amount was too small, so he turned it down. The following year, he said, was a struggle.When Hurricane Sandy hit, Mr. Lucci’s vehicles were still insured for liability only. His office and garage were insured, as was $30,000 in equipment. But, like many business owners, he carried no protection against floodwaters or business interruption. After the storm, Mr. Lucci said, he received $5,800 for wind damage and nothing for what was destroyed by water.THE OPTIONS Mr. Lucci has concluded he has two options. He can close the business for good, or he can borrow a lot of money and try to make another go of it.New York City has been offering emergency loans to small businesses of up to $25,000, interest-free for the first six months and 1 percent interest for the 24 months after that. The city approved Mr. Lucci for such a loan, but he said it would barely make a dent. “I couldn’t even fix my office,” he said.A local office of the Small Business Administration has urged him to apply for a fixed-rate disaster loan. The agency has said businesses can obtain as much as $2 million at 4 percent interest for up to 30 years. One drawback? The S.B.A. told him he would be required to have flood insurance, and Mr. Lucci fears that could cost him up to $25,000 a year.In addition, Mr. Lucci said he would have to put up the home he shares with his wife as collateral. He turns 61 in May. “I don’t know how I’m going to pay it back,” he said. “I’ll finish paying when I’m 90. I might not be here.”He knows that some businesses that get disaster loans end up defaulting — according to the S.B.A., the government wrote off $153 million, or nearly 2.5 percent, of the $6 billion in loans made after Hurricane Katrina. If the Automobile Film Club is one of those businesses that never rebounds, he knows he could lose everything.“I want to leave something to my family,” he said. “What if I lose my house if something doesn’t go good?”WHAT OTHERS SAY Kevin Langley, co-founder of Ellis Construction, in New Orleans, whose business was devastated by Hurricane Katrina: “Use the $25,000 New York City emergency loan and the S.B.A. loan to purchase assets that can generate revenues. Consider working out of your house or a temporary office until you are able to rebuild the office with cash flows. Consider the salvage value of the existing damaged fleet and sell off any vehicles and assets that will not generate revenue or that aren’t critical to the operation to generate cash.”William Mathewson, president of Home Comfort Warehouse in White River Junction, Vt., took an S.B.A. loan to rebuild his alternative heating company after it was flooded in 2012: “I think Mr. Lucci, at age 60, has to ask himself what does he want to be doing in five years. If he wants to retire, he should determine if his business will be sellable in five years and if the projected value is at least what his S.B.A. loan balance will be. He shouldn’t take out a large loan, putting his home up for security only to find out the business is worth less than the loan. If that’s the case, he might be better off shutting down now and going to work for someone else. I don’t think he should spend three years losing money while he rebuilds the business.”Rohit Arora, co-founder of Biz2Credit, which arranges small-business loans: ""If he liquidates the business, what sort of work could he do? It would likely be very difficult for him to find a decent paying job at his age. In rebuilding his company, he knows what he is getting into. One thing he should not do is open again in a flooded area. After being hit twice, why open again in Staten Island when he can set up operations elsewhere in New York City?”THE RESULTS Offer your thoughts on the You’re the Boss blog at nytimes.com/boss. Next week, on the blog and on this page, we will give an update on what Mr. Lucci is planning to do."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/arts/dance/new-york-city-ballet-at-koch-theater.html,"The terrific density of New York City Ballet’s repertory, without parallel anywhere in the world, is something its audience often takes for granted. We’re now less than halfway into the fourth week of the company’s six-week winter season. Already it has presented 21 ballets. These include 12 by George Balanchine, 2 each by Jerome Robbins, Peter Martins and the promising young choreographer Justin Peck, as well as one each by William Forsythe, Alexei Ratmansky and Christopher Wheeldon.The spectrum runs from some essentially 19th-century ballets to 21st-century ones; such a season can alter and enrich anyone’s sense of the history of the art form. While the 10 Tchaikovsky ballets by Balanchine, seen together, deepen our view of both composer and choreographer, the revival of the rarely seen “Variations pour une Porte et un Soupir” complicates the Balanchine picture. To see “N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz” (1958) and “Glass Pieces” (1983) in quick succession is to realize what a cannily poetic urban sociologist Robbins was. To see the two Peck ballets on programs where Mr. Peck is still dancing in the ballets by Balanchine, Robbins and Mr. Ratmansky brings a real frisson.Last Friday night at the David H. Koch Theater the company introduced a new program called Art Series, with seats selling at $29. The orchestra took the night off; two of the evening’s four ballets were to taped music, two to piano. In the intermissions, the principal dancer Sébastien Marcovici served as D.J. — playing rock music from a sound system in the upstairs foyer. When Peter Martins, the company’s ballet master in chief, in front of the curtain, asked how many in the audience had never been to City Ballet, at least 30 percent raised their hands. Since some of those newcomers spoke at once of returning, the experiment is a healthy one.Although this wasn’t a great quadruple bill — Mr. Wheeldon’s “Polyphonia” (2001), Mr. Forsythe’s “Herman Schmerman (Pas de Deux)” (1992), Balanchine’s “Porte et Soupir” (1974), and Mr. Martins’s “Waltz Project” (1988) — its sheer range of idioms must have fascinated even some of the most ballet-resistant audience members. The dancers Georgina Pazcoguin and Adrian Danchig-Waring charmingly introduced the program from the stage, with just the right lack of pretension.“Polyphonia” is a group of études that marvelously lead the eye through the possibilities of modern ballet classicism. The “Herman Schmerman (Pas de Deux)” is a flip collection of showy effects. “The Waltz Project,” which has seemed Mr. Martins’s best ballet, and which looked good last July in the company’s season in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., now looks merely inconsequential.Even though “Porte et Soupir” is very minor and entirely bizarre Balanchine, it proved Friday evening’s best — most haunting — work. Here Pierre Henry’s 1963 electronic musique concrète score becomes the basis for a crazy drama between male and female forces. While the man, Sigh (Soupir), stays particular, querulous, investigative, the woman, Door (Porte), opens out from a mechanical 1920s showgirl by way of a dominatrix, into an all-encompassing vortex. Daniel Ulbricht’s Sigh has too much adrenaline and too little pathos; but Maria Kowroski’s Door is her great role of the season, making the most of her dancing’s tremendous scale and cool allure.This Tuesday after the company again performed “The Waltz Project,” “N.Y. Export: Opus Jazz” returned to repertory, a vivid slice of history that features only dancers from the company’s corps and soloist ranks. It’s a happy meeting. You can easily imagine how Robbins would treasure several of these dancers — notably Ms. Pazcoguin, Ashley Laracey, Chase Finlay, Mr. Peck, Zachary Catazaro, Taylor Stanley — while all of them in turn evidently cherish this ballet. The music, by Robert Prince, is a 1950s genre of jazz that could easily sound dated, but they swim in it with the kind of rhythmic ease that keeps it fresh.It’s well known that most of Robbins’s best ballets are about adolescents. Yet who’d have thought his vision of the children of the 1950s would stay so “now” this long? The mixture of laid-back cool and high-pressure intensity is marvelous. In “Passage for Two,” Ms. Laracey and Mr. Finlay meet as if by chance; touch and feel each other with increasingly potent contact and friction; and then go their separate ways without so much as a backward glance.As some of these corps dancers perform two or more ballets per evening, you can watch them moving from mere aptitude to compelling luster. Some principals (not all) keep growing too. In the account of Balanchine’s “Tschaikovsky Piano Concerto No. 2,” which closed Tuesday’s evening, it was moving to watch how Ashley Bouder and Savannah Lowery have grown since opening night three weeks before. Ms. Bouder blazed through the steps with the kind of high-lucidity utterance we haven’t seen since Merrill Ashley in the 1980s. Ms. Lowery, more refined throughout her upper body and yet brighter in her delivery, gave us dancing as fluent and joyous as full-throated bird song."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/arts/television/community-returns-on-nbc-without-dan-harmon.html,"One of the many reasons to watch the first three seasons of “Community,” the fiercely quirky and unapologetically smart NBC sitcom, was that you actually had to watch it. Every offhand remark, every reaction shot, every bit of physical business communicated something (usually something funny). More than any other show in prime time it demanded that you pay attention.The sad simulacrum of “Community” that checks in Thursday for Season 4 makes no such claim on your concentration. Send a few e-mails, look at the television, order a pizza, look back at the TV. You won’t miss anything important, because there’s nothing important to miss.Dan Harmon, the man who created “Community” and its misfit collection of community-college study partners, was cut loose after last season, a victim of low ratings — the series averaged four million viewers and finished 144th among prime-time shows — and of having a reputation for being difficult to work with. Rather than cancel the show, which finished a more encouraging 102nd in the crucial 18-to-49 demographic, NBC handed it to a new pair of producers, David Guarascio and Moses Port. Replacing an original show runner has been in vogue lately, and it’s not by definition a bad thing. “The Walking Dead” did fine when Frank Darabont was replaced by Glen Mazzara (who has since been replaced as well), and the jury is still out on “Smash” after Theresa Rebeck’s departure. But with “Community” the drop-off looks startling.The show has been dumbed down, its humor broadened past recognition, and the two episodes provided for review — Thursday’s season premiere, “History 101,” and the Feb. 21 entry, “Conventions of Space and Time” — have fewer laughs between them than a single good scene from the old “Community.” (If you’re not already a fan of Seasons 1, 2 and 3, you can see for yourself online at Hulu, Amazon Instant Video, iTunes or Vudu.)“History 101,” reintroducing the series after the highly publicized contentiousness surrounding Mr. Harmon’s departure, is busy enough to distract you for a while from the new lack of substance. The study group arrives to start its final year in school, and the high-strung Abed (Danny Pudi) is so freaked out by events that he keeps retreating into his mind, where he imagines several alternate TV shows starring his friends.There’s a metaphor here for the tribulations of “Community” itself — we’re told that “Abed was having some anxiety about all the changes this year” — and when one of the shows Abed imagines is a lamebrained laugh-track sitcom, it reads as Mr. Guarascio and Mr. Port’s winking assurance to the audience that it’s not as bad as all that.It’s not good, though. Exactly one line in the episode — when the louche college dean played by Jim Rash is told he smells like the floor of a movie theater and he replies, “Yeah, but not for the usual reasons” — sneaks up on you the way the old show’s writing always did.A tossed-off sendup of “The Hunger Games” evokes Mr. Harmon’s fondness for pop-culture homage but is otherwise pointless. The new show is also louder (Mr. Harmon’s version was surprisingly quiet for a sitcom) and visually blander, with a heavy reliance on close-ups.The title “History 101” ties the episode to the Season 3 opener, “Biology 101,” but that’s not a comparison the show’s new minders should be encouraging. Like them Mr. Harmon had a statement to make: Flouting criticism that his humor was too obscurantist and pop culture obsessed, he began the season with a hilarious — as well as dynamic and tuneful — production number that proclaimed, “We’re going to have more fun and be less weird than the first two years combined.” Fortunately, he didn’t mean it.“Biology 101” was also the episode in which Britta (Gillian Jacobs) introduced Abed to “Inspector Spacetime” (a thinly veiled copy of “Doctor Who”), telling him, “It’s a British sci-fi show that’s been on the air since 1962.” So fans of the old “Community” may be puzzled by the Feb. 21 episode, largely set at an “Inspector Spacetime” convention, in which Britta seems to be learning about the show for the first time, asking, “Wow, there are 50 years of these, huh?”It’s a small detail, but those matter in a show like “Community,” and not remembering or caring is another break of faith.Which comes back to the idea of paying attention. The world of libraries and classrooms and off-campus apartments that Mr. Harmon created was highly detailed and fully realized, as were the crackpots and misanthropes who inhabited it. They might have been nut cases who negotiated reality through bad puns and movie references, but they were substantial and complex nut cases. In the new season they’ve been flattened and, especially in a story line in which Annie (Alison Brie) imagines marrying the bad boy Jeff (Joel McHale), sentimentalized. Also, they’re just not very funny.There’s no reason Mr. Guarascio and Mr. Port should be expected to reproduce Mr. Harmon’s style or sensibility. And their assignment wasn’t easy. Taking over a quirky comedy like “Community” is probably more difficult than taking over a more formulaic drama — hourlong shows from “NYPD Blue” to “NCIS” to “The Walking Dead” have survived changes in show runners, and even thrived. Being asked to take a show with a distinctive, delicate chemistry and increase its audience is definitely a more difficult proposition than being asked to maintain an already highly rated franchise.But the changes in “Community” feel like a total surrender. What the new episodes often resemble is the type of post-“Friends” sitcom that is defined by a jokey solipsism, in which the humor comes not from anything we’d recognize as real life but from the barely distinguishable characters’ constant battle to one-up one another. As it happens, Mr. Guarascio and Mr. Port worked together on one of those shows, “Happy Endings.”The self-reflexiveness of the season premiere, with its “changes” theme, continues in the Feb. 21 episode, which includes an odd sequence in which Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) and the contrarian Pierce (Chevy Chase, who has said this is his last season) are in a focus group discussing an American remake of “Inspector Spacetime.” Pierce favors dumbing down, saying, “It’s funny because it’s clear.” Given Mr. Chase’s public unhappiness in the past with his character and the show in general, that’s some sort of in joke, though it’s not clear who’s the target.Shirley, meanwhile, argues for sensitivity: “It’s smart, complicated and doesn’t talk down to its audience, so if you’d like to make a really good American version, you should stay true to that.” How should a “Community” fan read that: apology or taunt?Apparently the new producers know what we want, but they won’t, or can’t, give it to us."

The young woman, who later committed suicide, received a threatening text message from a friend of the player — not from another team member.HOMEA brief report on the Currents page on Jan. 24 about Japan Creative, a nonprofit organization that supports traditional Japanese crafts and the businesses that produce them, misspelled part of the name of a company that has been working with the Israeli designer Ron Gilad to create walnut chests.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/arts/television/whats-on-thursday.html,"1:30 P.M. (MoreMax) THE DESCENDANTS (2011) Matt King (George Clooney, in an Oscar-nominated role), a real estate lawyer whose family tree includes the earliest white settlers in Hawaii as well as indigenous royalty, struggles to make the right decision regarding his family’s birthright: a pristine and picturesque tract on Kauai. Should it be sold to developers? In the meantime his wife, Elizabeth (Patricia Hastie), is in a coma in a Honolulu hospital after a boating accident. Not long after her doctors inform Matt that he is about to become a widower and a single father to two difficult daughters, Scottie (Amara Miller) and Alex (Shailene Woodley), he learns that Elizabeth was having an affair. Robert Forster portrays Elizabeth’s enraged father, who blames his daughter’s condition on Matt’s tightwad ways; Matthew Lillard plays Brian, the object of Elizabeth’s affection; Judy Greer is Brian’s wife; Nick Krause (above, with, from left, Mr. Clooney, Ms. Miller and Ms. Woodley) is Alex’s goofy sidekick; and Beau Bridges is Matt’s cousin. Mr. Clooney’s actorly instincts “have never been keener or more generous,” and Ms. Woodley gives “one of the toughest, smartest, most credible adolescent performances in recent memory,” A. O. Scott wrote in The New York Times about this drama directed by Alexander Payne and based on the novel by Kaui Hart Hemmings. He added: “Mr. Payne, with a light touch and a keen sense of place — this Hawaii is as real and peculiar as the Nebraska of ‘About Schmidt’ or the California wine country of ‘Sideways’ — has made a movie that, for all its modesty, is as big as life. Its heart is occupied by grief, pain and the haunting silence of Elizabeth, whose version of events is the only one we never hear. And yet it is also full of warmth, humor and the kind of grace that can result from our clumsy attempts to make things better.”8:30 P.M.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/us/california-archdiocese-will-release-more-files.html,"The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles says that it will release more documents and undo redactions in response to complaints that the files it released last week on priests accused of sexual abuse were incomplete or that the names of church officials who had handled abuse cases had been blacked out. J. Michael Hennigan, a lawyer for the archdiocese, said that he had no idea why the documents were missing, but that as journalists, lawyers and victims caught the omissions, the archdiocese would add the information to the files it had posted online. Last week the archdiocese, under court order after a six-year dispute, made public internal church documents on 124 priests accused of abuse."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/sports/cycling/red-hook-criterium-is-now-a-4-race-cycling-series.html,"On a chilly night in March 2008, a dozen or so cyclists sped through Brooklyn’s industrial Red Hook neighborhood on fixed-gear bicycles, dodging city buses and parked cars as bewildered neighbors looked on. The clandestine race was coined the Red Hook Criterium, but it was more spectacle than sporting event.“A couple of volunteers were trying to stop traffic, but cars kept pulling out,” said Kacey Manderfield, the race’s eventual winner. “I was in a panic mode the whole time.”The Red Hook Criterium, known informally as the Red Hook Crit, has evolved into one of the city’s biggest cycling events. Gone are the buses and cars: the race’s organizer, David Trimble, moved the course in 2011 from the city streets to a one-kilometer loop at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal.About 3,000 spectators attended the 2012 race, and banners advertising the race’s sponsors lined the course. The entry spots for the 100 starters filled rapidly, and racers traveled from as far as Milan, where Trimble operates another fixed-gear race.This year the Red Hook Criterium is expanding again, into a four-race series. Besides the March 30 race at the cruise terminal, Trimble will run a similar race on June 8 at the Brooklyn Navy Yard. He will also have a race in Barcelona, Spain, at the Parc del Fòrum on Aug. 24 and one in Milan in early October. Points will accumulate and an overall champion will be named.The expansion comes after Trimble signed a sponsorship deal with Rockstar Games, the video game developer.“We saw how much people cared about the race, and it only happened once a year,” Trimble said. “And as our sponsorship needs increased, I saw this as a way to build a year-round marketing platform.”The deal puts Red Hook on a budgetary plane with mainstream professional races in the United States, whose sponsorships have generally been hurt by the doping controversies in cycling. The nation’s longest-running professional cycling race, the Philadelphia International Cycling Championship, recently canceled its 2013 edition after a fruitless sponsorship hunt.The Red Hook Criterium, however, does not attract professionals. The field is a blend of amateur road and track racers, bicycle messengers and urban cycling advocates. Trimble said his initial goal was to pit mainstream cyclists against bicycle messengers to determine which group performed best on the fixed-gear track bikes. The race is about 45 minutes long. Last year the cyclists completed 24 laps.On a track bike, a rider cannot coast, and stopping requires locking up the rear wheel into a skid because there are no hand brakes. Unsurprisingly, high-speed pileups are a regular part of the Red Hook Criterium.“You feel like it’s a bucking bronco when you first get on the bike,” said Gabe Lloyd, a road racer who crashed at the 2012 race. “The first time you come to a corner, it’s like, ‘Oh, God, where are the brakes?’ ”Fixed-gear criteriums have become popular in recent years. Trimble said he had received hundreds of queries from organizers who were trying to organize new races, and he keeps a spreadsheet of 38 global races similar to his that have begun recently.Kris Fay, who runs the Discovery Criterium in Sacramento and is planning three other fixed-gear races in Northern California, attributes the growth in part to Red Hook’s popularity.“It’s definitely the first event to have pushed track bike criteriums to being as popular as they are,” he said. “It’s the first thing that comes to mind when I hear the word ‘crit.’ ”The growth of fixed-gear racing has occurred without the oversight of USA Cycling, the sport’s national governing body. A spokesman said USA Cycling’s rules for road races require bicycles to have a freewheel and two brakes, which eliminates the fixed-gear format. Trimble said he had not asked USA Cycling to sanction his event.“What we’re doing is new and different and doesn’t really fall into what USA Cycling is doing,” he said. “We feel like cycling can grow from a different angle.”USA Cycling, however, provides insurance coverage at its 3,041 sanctioned events, to assist riders who are injured in crashes. Trimble pays for insurance out of each racer’s $45 entry fee. He said his policy covered him and the site from being sued. He also pays to have paramedics at the race. “You more or less race at your own risk,” he said. “If you get hurt during the race, you are responsible for it.”Dieter Drake, who organizes the Tour of the Battenkill road race in Cambridge, N.Y., one of USA Cycling’s most popular events, with 5,000 participants, said Red Hook’s success could persuade mainstream race organizers to hold unsanctioned events to save money.“There used to be the conception that you had to be a USA Cycling event to get participants, and that isn’t the case anymore,” said Drake, who is contemplating removing his race from the USA Cycling umbrella next year.Drake said unsanctioned events could appeal to racers who were dissatisfied with mainstream cycling’s era of complacency regarding corruption and doping. The Red Hook Criterium, he believes, could bring a sea change in amateur racing.“It’s refreshing to see somebody pop out of the woodwork with this renegade style race,” he said. “Maybe in 15 years his style ends up being the dominant form of racing. Who knows.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/07/arts/music/the-minnesota-orchestra-in-concert-as-a-lockout-continues.html,"MINNEAPOLIS — Sibelius’s music is thought by many to reflect the long, deep winters of his native Finland. So if you’re looking to Sibelius to shed a bit of warmth, it must be cold.No, not the weather. (Well, that too.) What most needs thawing here is the frigid standoff between the board and management of the Minnesota Orchestra and its players, who have been locked out since Oct. 1, after they rejected management’s proposal for a 32 percent cut in base pay and refused to make a counterproposal.Mayor R. T. Rybak and Judy Dayton, one of the orchestra’s most generous benefactors, tried to warm things up last Friday evening by presenting a special concert in the auditorium of the Minneapolis Convention Center to celebrate the ensemble’s Grammy nomination for its Bis recording of Sibelius’s Symphonies Nos. 2 and 5. Osmo Vanska, the orchestra’s music director, conducted it for the first time since July in blazing performances of both works and, as an encore, Sibelius’s rousing “Finlandia.”The recording is indeed superb, easily one of the best of 2012, and the concert represented it well, despite compromised circumstances. Some quarter of the players, more than 20, were substitutes, filling in for orchestra musicians who had left or taken other work during the lockout. (True, several were regular subs, including some from the St. Paul Chamber Orchestra, which is also embroiled in a lockout but said to be closer to a settlement.)What’s more, the acoustics of the convention center’s 3,000-seat all-purpose auditorium are not ideal for orchestral music, and some amplification was used. Still, the orchestra played like the truly great ensemble it has become in nine seasons under Mr. Vanska, and he managed to replicate the breathtaking pianissimos and other subtleties of the recording.The convention center is where the orchestra had planned to play its concerts this season, with Orchestra Hall in the midst of a $50 million renovation that figures prominently in the players’ discontent. Some of the change is integral to the ensemble’s musical mission, intended, for example, to improve onstage acoustics. But much of it involves amenities, with an expansion of the lobby and new facilities designed to attract social and other events.The players argue that the construction money should be directed toward their salaries, and some go so far as to suggest that the orchestra association plans to phase out the musical mission altogether. Management says that the money was raised specifically for the renovation, and that the added income the new features may bring is necessary to the ensemble’s long-term welfare.“Everything in the hall is for the betterment of the orchestra,” said Michael Henson, the ensemble’s president and chief executive.No one questions the need for money. The orchestra reported deficits of $2.9 million in 2011 and $6 million in 2012. Previous budgets were balanced with large draws from the endowment.The last players’ contract, negotiated by the board in 2007, when there was no executive director, was based on optimistic assumptions that were immediately undercut by the recession. The current endowment, $141 million, falls some $90 million short of the 2007 prediction.That five-year contract was to have given the players a 25 percent raise over its term, though with voluntary givebacks from them, the raises amounted to 19 percent. The current base pay is $113,000 annually, with most players making considerably more, for an average salary of $135,000. The proposed base pay is $78,000, with an average of $89,000.The cuts that Mr. Henson is advocating would reduce the ensemble’s annual budget to $26 million from $32 million. He refuses to consider making further inroads on the endowment, portions of which are restricted from large draws, saying that they would endanger the future of the orchestra.Jon Campbell, the chairman, concurs. “We cannot continue on that course,” he said in a statement, “or our endowment will be depleted by 2018.”Management awaits a counterproposal from the players, but they have refused to accept the figures produced by a management-procured audit. They want an independent analysis that would look ahead as well as back.“We’re not throwing grenades,” said Tim Zavadil, the chairman of the musicians’ negotiating committee. “We’re just asking questions.”The management recently agreed in principle to an independent study, but even if the players agree, it will take time. The orchestra’s next concert still on the calendar is scheduled for Feb. 27, but no one expects it to happen.Amid all the financial and procedural haggling in the time leading up to the Grammy concert, an angelic presence, Eriko Matsukawa, seemed to hover above the fray and at least momentarily direct attention to music and its importance.Ms. Matsukawa, a blind English teacher, interpreter and translator from Sendai, Japan, fell in love with the orchestra during two years she spent at the University of Minnesota in the late 1990s. When she lost much of her hearing in the 2011 earthquake, she applied her own music therapy.“I spent eight days listening to music for 24 hours,” much of it played by the Minnesota Orchestra, she said. Her hearing came back.When she learned of the lockout last year, she was heartbroken. Though not wealthy, she contributed more than $5,000 to the players. To ease her grief further, she learned origami and made 96 colorful paper cranes, one for each player, which the musicians now display proudly at their unofficial rehearsals and performances.Ms. Matsukawa, who made the trip from Japan for the Grammy concert, was invited to sit among the players during rehearsals, and at the dress rehearsal on Friday morning she alternately beamed and wept.So the question is how to get from here to there. Win or lose at the Grammys on Sunday, the orchestra will immediately put itself in the running for next year’s awards on Monday, with the release of Sibelius’s Symphonies Nos. 1 and 4 (also by Bis). But will another sequel follow?No one here is making any guarantees about that or about more immediate concerns: Will the orchestra be around to open the renovated hall in the fall? Will it travel to Carnegie Hall next season for its recently announced four concerts of Sibelius, including all the symphonies? In short, will it survive?It must, for Ms. Matsukawa’s sake and for the sake of the world orchestral scene. Still, it is all as suspenseful as the enigmatic ending of that Sibelius Fifth Symphony."

Alan Ladd plays the American archaeologist who wants the couple to donate the sculpture to a museum; Clifton Webb is the aesthete who covets it — and Phaedra — for himself. “The outcome of this benign struggle is clear almost from the start,” A. H. Weiler wrote in The New York Times. “Jean Negulesco, who also was responsible for ‘Three Coins,’ and the rest of his troupe, did not waste color film. The trip paid off in fine, unusual, exotic and beautiful footage for this first American company to shoot in Greece.” He said that Ms. Loren appeared “as decorative as any classic statue,” and that she “is given ample opportunity to be photographed against island rocks and in the fish- and frond-filled green murky depths of the sea.” And he continued that she “delivers herself of some fiery emotion to prove that she is also willing and able to act.”7 P.M.

(Chinen)Ben Monder Trio (Saturday) A painterly guitarist equally adept with color and line, Ben Monder does his earthiest work in this format, backed by bass and drums. That’s earthy in relative terms; his rhythm section, with Chris Lightcap on bass and Jochen Rueckert on drums, doesn’t ground him so much as keep pace.

(Chinen)William Parker: ‘Alphaville Suite’ (Thursday) Mr. Parker is known as a bassist best suited to combustible free-form settings, but he’s also a composer unafraid of pursuing ambitious ideas. For this concert, the first installment in a three-night residency, he presents a live soundtrack to “Alphaville,” the 1965 Jean-Luc Godard film, with an ensemble that includes the trumpeter Lewis Barnes, the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the pianist Cooper-Moore, and an improvising string quartet with Alex Waterman on cello and Jason Hwang, Jean Cook and Mazz Swift on violins. At 8 p.m., Roulette, 509 Atlantic Avenue, near Third Avenue, Boerum Hill, Brooklyn, (917) 267-0363, roulette.org; $15, $10 students and members.

At 9 and 11 p.m., 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)★ Dafnis Prieto Sextet (Friday through Sunday) The Cuban drummer Dafnis Prieto, an essential fixture on New York’s progressive Latin jazz scene, recently received a MacArthur fellowship, underscoring his focused ambition as a conceptualist and composer. Here he leads a group not unlike the one on his 2008 album, “Taking the Soul for a Walk” (Dafnison): Ralph Alessi on trumpet, Roman Filiu and Felipe Lamoglia on saxophones, Osmany Paredes on piano and Ben Street on bass. At 7:30 and 9:30 p.m., with an 11:30 set on Friday and Saturday, Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 and $30 cover.

Her steadiest partner has been Mr. Lubambo, a virtuoso with a light touch, who rejoins her here. At 7:30 and 10:30 p.m., Jazz Standard, 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net; $25 cover, $30 on Thursday. (Chinen)McCoy Tyner Trio with Gary Bartz (Tuesday and Wednesday) The rumble of McCoy Tyner’s pianism has quieted a bit over the years, but he can still be a compelling stylist, especially in conjunction with Mr. Bartz, an incisively soulful saxophonist. On bass is Gerald Cannon, and on drums is Francisco Mela. At 8 and 10:30 p.m., Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-8592, bluenote.net; $35 cover at tables, $20 at the bar, with a $5 minimum. (Chinen)★ Vanguard Jazz Orchestra (Monday through Feb. 18) Typically this big band holds court only on Monday nights, but next week it will celebrate its 47th anniversary, drawing from a repertory fortified by some of the smartest composer-arrangers ever to ply the form. The long engagement is welcome, because it presents the musicians with a chance to really settle in — and also for the simple reason that hearing this band, in this room, is one of the irreducible New York pleasures. At 9 and 11 p.m., Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at 11th Street, West Village, (212) 255-4037, villagevanguard.com; $25 cover, with a one-drink minimum. (Chinen)"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/arts/spare-times-for-children-for-feb-8-14.html,"‘SHOW WAY’Masters usually didn’t allow slaves to learn to read or write, but many captives did know how to sew.What those slaves made — and how that stitching became a powerful language itself — forms the heart of “Show Way,” Vital Theater Company’s new musical, based on the children’s book of the same title by Jacqueline Woodson. But while the book, winner of a Newbery Honor, reads almost like a documentary, chronicling one black family’s lineage through the tradition of quilting, “Show Way” onstage has the usual elements of a story, with a contemporary heroine and a problem to be solved. If Ms. Woodson’s writing evokes a carefully pieced pattern, Melody Cooper’s script emerges as more of a crazy quilt, to which Ms. Cooper has added colorful bits of different cultures, patches of humor and even a thread of the supernatural.The show begins as Mathis May (Danea Robinson, right), a slave, proclaims, “This here is my family tree.” “This here” is Kyle Dixon’s imaginative set, consisting of layered panels resembling quilt squares. They slide to become walls, doors and, in the center, a recessed window to the past, with glimpses of the 1860s and 1960s.Although Mathis plays a pivotal role, the action centers on Toshi Georgiana (Ashley Lynette Brown), her 11-year-old descendant. Toshi has lost the quilt square that’s been handed down to her and that’s supposed to be the centerpiece of her grandmother’s birthday celebration. The square recalls the kind of quilt known as a “show way,” whose images revealed routes to the Underground Railroad. Toshi frantically enlists her friends (David Andino, Norma Hernandez, Christine Lee and Donnell E. Smith), whose roots range from Jewish to Japanese, to help her search before her mother (Adiagha Faizah) finds out.Toshi and Mathis’s entwined histories unfold to Tyrone L. Robinson’s versatile score and lyrics, which have the flavors of spirituals, country tunes, pop and even rap. Directed by Melissa Maxwell, the cast members have both agile voices and nimble feet. (Brandon Kelly choreographed.)Although historians now dispute whether slaves’ quilts incorporated hidden codes, the controversy is irrelevant to the production, which includes a small show from the Quilters’ Guild of Brooklyn in the theater lobby. As “Show Way” demonstrates, every cherished heirloom carries a message, which may have nothing to do with liberty but has everything to do with love.(Through March 3. Saturdays and Sundays, and Feb. 18 and 19, at 11 a.m. and 1 p.m., McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, 212-579-0528, vitaltheatre.org; $25 and $30.) LAUREL GRAEBERFor Children ‘The Adventures of Maya the Bee’ (Saturday) This feisty puppet heroine has buzzed back to the Culture Project, where her journey began a dozen years ago. Based on a children’s book by the German author Waldemar Bonsels, “The Adventures of Maya the Bee” relates the title character’s flight from the hive in search of tastes more exotic than honey. The revival has new sets and props, but the same intricate rod and shadow puppets designed by Zofia Czechlewska. Adapted by Rachel Klein, with a score and lyrics by the jazz artist Nancy Harrow, who also conceived the show, “Maya” is a jazz musical for children, and how often do you encounter those? (The run is open-ended.) Saturdays at 10:30 a.m., 45 Bleecker Street, near Lafayette Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, cultureproject.org; $25.‘The African Drum’ (Sunday) Shadow Box Theater’s multimedia presentation of traditional African tales features characters that include a talking leopard, a wise loon and a turtle that is just as resourceful as the hero of “The Tortoise and the Hare.” All are shadow puppets, manipulated behind a lighted screen so that the colorful animals appear to be frolicking in the grasslands. With story and music by Sandra Robbins, the production focuses on Kijana, a little girl who relates the narratives and has her own brush with danger. At 3 p.m., National Black Theater, 2031 Fifth Avenue, near 125th Street, East Harlem, (212) 724-0677, shadowboxtheatre.org; $10 in advance; $15 at the door. Reservations requested.‘Archaeology Zone: Discovering Treasures From Playgrounds to Palaces’ (Friday, Sunday through Tuesday, and Thursday) Children will step into the shoes of an explorer like Indiana Jones in this permanent exhibition at the Jewish Museum, but the adventures will be purely scholarly. Still, there is plenty of excitement in analyzing artifacts like a jar handle, a clay jug and a bangle and figuring out the purpose behind ancient pieces like a Greek helmet and a bull-shaped vessel. This interactive show, for ages 3 to 10, also includes a recreated room from the Ottoman period (about 1900), where young archaeologists can dress in costume. From 11 a.m. to 5:45 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Thursdays and to 4 p.m. on Fridays; 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. Free with admission: $12; $10 for 65+; $7.50 for students; free for under 12 and members.‘The Art of “Rise of the Guardians” ’  (Friday through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) How did they do that? This question frequently comes to mind when viewing the complex animation in some of today’s films, and now the Museum of the Moving Image offers visitors an answer for one of those movies: “Rise of the Guardians,” a recent DreamWorks release. This new exhibition consists of more than 25 original drawings and sketches, along with design materials, production artifacts and behind-the-scenes footage of the making of the film, an adventure about immortal heroes like Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy. (Through March 3.) The show is accompanied by a retrospective weekend screening series of DreamWorks films. This weekend the film at 1 p.m. is the animated “Megamind,” a satire in which Brad Pitt and Will Ferrell provide the voices for two superheroes locked in a battle of good and evil. Museum hours: 10:30 a.m. to 5 p.m. weekdays; to 8 p.m. on Fridays; 11:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. on weekends; 35th Avenue at 37th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718) 784-0077, movingimage.us. Exhibition and screenings are free with admission: $12; $9 for students and 65+; $6 for ages 3 to 12; free for under 3, members and to all on Fridays from 4 to 8 p.m.Baby Got Bach (Sunday) The pianist Orli Shaham, a mother of twins, draws on her musical and her maternal talents as the host and artistic director of this concert series, intended for ages 3 to 6. One big draw: little ones don’t just hear instruments played; they also play with them during a preshow exploration and take part in an informal jam session before the program begins. This year’s concert season is taking place at a new site: the 92nd Street Y. At 10 a.m. (sold out) and noon, 1395 Lexington Avenue, (212) 415-5500, babygotbach.org; $18.Baby Loves Disco  (Sunday) Mommy and Daddy often love disco too, and they can enjoy these afternoon dance parties — with bona fide D.J.’s and ’70s and ’80s hits — along with their offspring. (The target age range is 6 months to 7 years.) Unlike clubs, these disco gatherings often feature diaper-changing stations, and unlike playgrounds, they usually have snacks and beverages for adults. This one offers a cash bar for parents, and chocolate treats, juice boxes, dance lessons, contests, and arts and crafts for little ones. From noon to 2:30 p.m., Le Poisson Rouge, 158 Bleecker Street, near Thompson Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 505-3474, babylovesdisco.com; $15; $55 for a family of four; free for those too young to walk.‘Bunnicula: A Rabbit Tale of Musical Mystery’ (Saturday and Sunday) Bunnies innocent and maybe not so innocent are the subject of the first Rabbit Season at DR2 Kids Theater, which is following up its recent production of “The Velveteen Rabbit” with “Bunnicula,” another collaboration with Theaterworks USA. An adaptation of the children’s book series by Deborah and James Howe, “Bunnicula” focuses on a pet rabbit with peculiar eating habits, and even more peculiar fangs. None other than Charles Busch (“The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife”) wrote the book for the show, which has music by Sam Davis and lyrics by Mark Waldrop. (Through April 14.) Previews on Saturday at 1 and 4 p.m., and Sunday at 1 p.m.; opens officially on Sunday at 4 p.m.; DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, dr2kidstheatre.com; twusa.org; $45; $35 for groups.‘Cenicienta/Cinderella’ (Saturday) The heroine could easily lose her glass slipper dancing the tango in this Latin-flavored musical from Teatro SEA, which specializes in Latino theater for children. Presented in an easily understood combination of English and Spanish, the production also features surprises: a dwarf who narrates and an unexpected character who fills in for the ill fairy godmother. (Also on March 2.) At 3 p.m., Los Kabayitos Puppet and Children’s Theater, Clemente Soto Vélez Cultural Center, 107 Suffolk Street, at Rivington Street, second floor, Lower East Side, (212) 529-1545, teatrosea.org; $18; $15 for children.‘Circle of Love’ Dads & Daughters Ball (Saturday) Romance isn’t the only kind of love worth honoring on Valentine’s Day. At this dance Brooklyn Children’s Museum will celebrate the bond between fathers and daughters (and mothers and sons, who are also welcome). The event will include a D.J., light refreshments and an appearance by Curious George. Guests will make valentines and pose for their own keepsake photos; each young visitor will get a corsage or a boutonniere.

V.I.P. packages are $40; $30 for members; fees for additional children are the same.‘Fancy Nancy the Musical’ (Saturday and Sunday) One of the arts’ youngest divas is back onstage, returning this weekend to the McGinn/Cazale Theater. This musical from Vital Theater Company focuses on a little girl who wants everything to be fancy — especially herself. Based on the book series written by Jane O’Connor and illustrated by Robin Preiss Glasser, the production explores the predicament that ensues when Nancy finds out that she hasn’t been cast as the glamorous mermaid she’d hoped to be in the coming dance show. With a book by Susan DiLallo, a score by Danny Abosch, and lyrics by both, the musical humorously follows Nancy’s attempts to cope with a most unfancy role: that of a tree. (Through April 28; closes on March 9 and then resumes on April 13.) At 3:30 p.m., McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, (212) 579-0528, vitaltheatre.org; $29.50; $49.50 for premium seats; tickets are limited.Film Forum Jr.: ‘Singin’ in the Rain’ (Sunday) Film Forum, the downtown cinema, is now the proud parent of Film Forum Jr., a new series (through March 31) introducing classic movies to children. This week’s title is “Singin’ in the Rain,” the 1952 musical featuring Gene Kelly and his inimitable moves. It will be shown with “Dancing on the Moon,” a Max Fleischer short. At 11 and 11:15 a.m., 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $7; first show is sold out.‘Flight of the Butterflies’ (Friday through Thursday) It’s easy to think of the graceful creatures that are the subject of this fascinating film as traveling only short distances, flitting from flower to flower. But half a billion monarch butterflies actually migrate 3,000 miles every fall, to Mexico from Canada. A new Imax movie, this project chronicles their journey and the 40-year investigation of it by one impassioned scientist, Fred A. Urquhart. (Through July 7.) Hourly, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., American Museum of Natural History, Central Park West and 79th Street, (212) 769-5200, amnh.org.

Audience members may even find themselves in bubbles of their own. (The run is open-ended.) Fridays at 7 p.m.; Saturdays at 11 a.m. and 2 and 4:30 p.m.; Sundays at noon and 3 p.m.; New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, gazillionbubbleshow.com; $44.50 to $99.50; lap seats for ages 2 and under are $20, at the box office only.‘Hollow’ (Saturday) Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman are off and riding again in this new musical from Be Bold!

(Through March 30.) At 5:30 p.m., Players Theater, 115 Macdougal Street, at Minetta Lane, Greenwich Village, (212) 352-3101, hollowthemusical.com; $35 to $50.Jazz for Kids (Sunday) Every Sunday during most of the school year the Jazz Standard presents not just jazz for kids, but also jazz by kids: the featured players at its Sunday brunches are the members of the Jazz Standard Youth Orchestra, a group of talented young people ages 11 to 18. In this series, which is celebrating its 10th year, the musicians play new arrangements of big-band classics while listeners enjoy barbecue offerings that include a children’s menu. (Through May 13.) Doors open at 1 p.m.; shows are from 1:30 to 3 p.m.; 116 East 27th Street, Manhattan, (212) 576-2232, jazzstandard.net/mobi/kids.

(Saturday) Children will know the answer by the end of this interactive program, part of Jazz at Lincoln Center’s family series. One surprise: Latin jazz originated in New York. The percussionist Bobby Sanabria, himself a Bronx native, will demonstrate its form and history, leading his Multiverse Big Band. At 1 and 3 p.m., with preconcert activities taking place 45 minutes before each set, the Rose Theater, Frederick P. Rose Hall, Jazz at Lincoln Center, 60th Street and Broadway, (212) 721-6500, jalc.org; $12 to $28.Kidrockers (Sunday) It’s hard to imagine mature, self-respecting, childless adults wanting — much less needing — to sneak into a kids’ show. But consider that the groups playing at the concerts Beth Lorge produces (for ages 3 to 13) are hot or up-and-coming rock and pop bands, and you can understand why she’s seen it happen. On Sunday she’s presenting two groups renowned for indie pop: Hospitality, a four-person band that promises to be as welcoming as its name, and Ex Cops, a Brooklyn duo. At 11:30 a.m. (doors open at 11), Brooklyn Bowl, 61 Wythe Avenue, between North 11th and 12th Streets, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (718) 963-3369, kidrockers.com; $8; $20 for a family four-pack, available by advance purchase only.Kids ‘N Comedy: ‘Young Love Show’ (Sunday) The class clown gets applause, not detention, at this series, in which tween and teenage comics perform stand-up. At this show the young performers will celebrate Valentine’s Day with a look at that great opportunity for comedy and crisis: adolescent romance. The material is recommended for children 9 and older, but there’s no need to worry about appropriateness (profanity is banned) or knock-knock jokes (these dudes are sophisticated). Reservations required. At 1 p.m., Gotham Comedy Club, 208 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212) 877-6115, kidsncomedy.com; $15, with a one-item (soda or food) minimum.La MaMa Kids: ‘Immerse Yourself!’ (Saturday) La MaMa, the downtown theater that recently celebrated 50 years of cultivating cutting-edge adults, is now turning its attention to cutting-edge kids.

Children ages 6 and older and their families can see how they did it by investigating the show “Drawing Surrealism” at the Morgan Library & Museum. This related program will involve games and art projects to illuminate Surrealist techniques like frottage, collaborative chance drawing and decalcomania. Never heard of them? All the more reason to visit. From 2 to 5 p.m., 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, Ext. 560, themorgan.org/programs; $6; $4 for members; $2 for children.‘The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe’ (Saturday) If the children of the Pevensie family could travel to the magical land of Narnia through something as simple as a wardrobe, why shouldn’t two hard-working actors be able to play them and all the characters found there? That’s what Catherine Fowles and Jara Jones are attempting in Off Broadway Family Theater’s first production, le Clanché du Rand’s adaptation of C. S. Lewis’s classic novel. (The run is open-ended.) At 11 a.m., St. Luke’s Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, narniaoffbroadway.com; $35.‘The Little Moon Theater’ (Saturday through Monday) The troupe of the title provides more than entertainment: its productions also grant wishes, solving problems or healing hearts with a carefully chosen play. Now Tada! Youth Theater will take over those roles in this revival of “The Little Moon Theater,” a musical based on the children’s book by Irene Haas. With a book by Michael Slade and music and lyrics by Joel Gelpe, the show also focuses on someone who has trouble granting wishes: Penelope, a bumbling fairy godmother who needs some extra help.

The Queens Zoo will celebrate the Lunar New Year with storytelling about these reptiles at 1, 2:15 and 3 p.m. each day, followed by a close-up encounter with either a boa constrictor or a black rat snake. Children can also make related crafts and learn about all the Chinese zodiac creatures from zookeepers. The first 100 to visit each day will receive a traditional New Year’s treat: a red envelope with a surprise inside. From noon to 4 p.m., 53-51 111th Street, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 271-1500, queenszoo.com. Free with admission: $8; $6 for 65+; $5 for 3 to 12; free for under 3 and members.‘The Mark of Zorro’ (Friday through Sunday) Many children today have probably never heard of Zorro, but their imaginations can surely find room for another hero, especially one with a sword and a mask. The Scottish theater company Visible Fictions is bringing Davey Anderson’s adaptation of Zorro’s adventures to the New Victory Theater, where they will be performed with a cast of only three — but that’s still enough for swashbuckling. After this Friday’s performance, the theater will also offer “Txt Marks the Spot,” an interactive family scavenger hunt involving maps and mobile devices. (Through Feb. 24.) Friday at 7 p.m.; Saturday at 2 and 7 p.m.; Sunday at noon and 5 p.m.; 209 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (646) 223-3010, newvictory.org; $14 to $38; $9 to $25 for members.‘Monkey King: A Story From China’ (Friday through Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) The Children’s Museum of Manhattan has welcomed back a mischievous hero: Monkey King, the star of this exhibition, which has traveled many miles for years, just like the character it centers on. The interactive show, inspired by the Chinese epic “The Journey to the West,” recreates many of the Monkey’s adventures, like fighting the Bull Demon at a station that resembles a video game. Much of the fun teaches Chinese values: cooperation, perseverance, bravery and self-sacrifice. (Through May.) Hours: 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays; Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org.

Koch Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 496-0600, nycballet.com; $20.New York Family Camp Fairs (Saturday and Sunday) Finding the right summer camp can be as complicated a process as finding the right school.

You can learn the reason in this wonderful new show from the Paper Bag Players, in which everything is fresh out of the bag: they’re presenting all new material, written by the actors and the artistic director, Ted Brackett. They’re still making magic out of cardboard and brown wrapping paper in these musically enhanced and highly interactive skits for ages 3 to 9, several of them with a Wild West slant. Saturday at 11 a.m.; Sunday at 3 p.m.; Symphony Space, 2537 Broadway, at 95th Street, (212) 864-5400, symphonyspace.org; thepaperbagplayers.org; $15 to $30.‘Perfect Catch: A Throwmantic Comedy’ (Saturday and Sunday) Love has a lot to do with finding a perfect catch, but in this family show, being revived as part of Canal Park Playhouse’s Classic Brunch Matinee series, the catching part is particularly important. Jen Slaw and Michael Karas, jugglers and circus performers, play co-workers who at first don’t like each other but share a mutual love of office pranks. Before long sparks — and a lot of other things — start to fly. (Through Feb. 24.)

Now the Swedish Cottage Marionette Theater is reviving its 2007 musical based on the Pippi stories by the Swedish author Astrid Lindgren. With a book by Zakiyyah Alexander and a score by Daryl Kojak, the production features almost two dozen handmade marionettes. Weekdays at 10:30 a.m. and noon, with an additional Wednesday performance at 2:30 p.m.; Saturdays and Sundays at 1 p.m., with an additional show this Saturday at 11 a.m.; 79th Street and the West Drive, Central Park, (212) 988-9093, cityparksfoundation.org/arts; $8; $5 for ages 12 and under.

This month the program is “Heroes & Villains: A Purim Tale,” giving young participants a chance to have some fun with masks and groggers while they explore the synagogue. They’ll seek answers to the mystery of how Queen Esther long ago saved the Jewish people from the machinations of her husband’s evil minister, Haman. From 11 a.m. to noon, 12 Eldridge Street, between Canal and Division Streets, Lower East Side, (212) 219-0302, eldridgestreet.org/visit/family; $15 a family. Reservations are recommended.Purim Bash With the Mama Doni Band (Sunday) Her stage name may sound as if it belongs on a jar of pasta sauce, but Mama Doni is an indisputably Jewish performer. Doni Zasloff Thomas in real life, she specializes in putting a Jewish spin on all kinds of musical styles. For this concert by the Mama Doni Band, devoted to the holiday of Purim, young visitors are invited to take part in a costume parade. They can also make crafts to use in the interactive show.

Crafts are free with the purchase of a concert ticket.‘Sesame Street Live: Elmo’s Super Heroes’ (Friday through Sunday, and Wednesday and Thursday) Sesame Street has a problem: Super Grover has lost his mojo — actually his superness — and needs help getting it back. This live stage production, which features actors in costume as the lovable Muppets of the “Sesame Street” TV show, sends Elmo and friends to the rescue. The result is a musical in which Grover and the young audience learn that good nutrition, exercise, adequate sleep and other healthy habits can make anyone feel super. (Through Feb. 18.) Friday at 11 a.m.; Saturday and Sunday at 10:30 a.m. and 2 and 5:30 p.m.; Wednesday and Thursday at 11 a.m.; a “Sesame Street” play zone is available to all ticket holders for an hour before each show.

It may sound a little dangerous but it promises to be fun: This event at the Whitney Museum celebrates the exhibition “Sinister Pop,” a look at the darker, more satirical aspects of Pop Art. Directed toward ages 5 through 12, the festivities will include an exploration of celebrity culture, as young visitors make Pop-inspired art, practice karaoke, have their photos taken on a red carpet and engage in interactive performances with the artists Dave McKenzie and the Bumbys. From noon to 3 p.m., (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. Free with admission: $18; $14 for students, ages 19 through 25 and 65+; free for members and 18 and under.‘10-Foot Cops: The NYPD’s Mounted Unit’ (Saturday, Sunday, and Tuesday through Thursday) Not all of the heroes of the Police Department walk on two legs; this new exhibition at the Children’s Museum of Manhattan celebrates the horses of the mounted unit and the officers who ride them. Lent by the New York City Police Museum, temporarily closed because of damage from Hurricane Sandy, the show includes uniforms, paintings, historical photos, film clips, a reproduction of a police stable and a saddle for children to pose in. Tuesdays through Sundays from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.; to 7 p.m. on Saturdays; Tisch Building, 212 West 83rd Street, (212) 721-1223, cmom.org. Free with admission: $11; $7 for 65+; free for under 1 and members.‘A Voyage Through Jewish History’ (Sunday through Thursday) This journey involves not just miles, but years. In this new permanent interactive exhibition at the Jewish Children’s Museum, young visitors can travel from Abraham and Sarah’s tent to the Western Wall in contemporary Jerusalem and beyond. Activities along the way include giving water to Rebecca’s camels, playing the strings on David’s harp (a high-tech version with beams of light that emit sounds when struck) and taking part in the exodus from Egypt. Museum hours: 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; to 5:30 p.m. on Sundays; 792 Eastern Parkway, at Kingston Avenue, Crown Heights, Brooklyn, (718) 907-8833, jcm.museum. Free with admission: $13; $10 for 65+; free for under 2.‘We’re Going on a Bear Hunt’ (Saturday) A bear hunt in Manhattan? This one promises to be safe for even the youngest participants, as the director Sally Cookson adapts Michael Rosen’s children’s book of the same title. Featuring a score by Benji Bower, the production, for ages 3 through 8, leads little explorers on a musical adventure through grass, river and mud, in search of that elusive bear. At 1:30 p.m., TriBeCa Performing Arts Center, Borough of Manhattan Community College, 199 Chambers Street, near Greenwich Street, (212) 220-1460, tribecapac.org; $25; $15 for 10Club members.David Weinstone and the Music for Aardvarks Band (Sunday) Music for aardvarks is also music for children, as Mr. Weinstone, a former punk rocker, will demonstrate in two concerts at the Jewish Museum. His group specializes in tunes for urban kids, as you can tell from titles like “Subway,” “Taxi” and “Staten Island Ferry.” The band, which prides itself on audience participation, will also perform songs from its most recent album, “All I Want!” At 11:30 a.m. and 2 p.m., 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3337, thejewishmuseum.org; $18; $13 for children; $15 and $11 for those with family-level memberships.‘Who’s Got the Beat?’ (Saturday and Sunday) The Lolli-Pops concerts from the Little Orchestra Society, for ages 3 through 5, use friendly characters like Bang, Bow, Buzz and Toot to introduce music. In this program little listeners will learn all about rhythm, as James Judd leads the orchestra in works by Bizet and Dvorak and scores celebrating the pulse of New York City. Saturday at 10 and 11:30 a.m.; Sunday at 1 and 2:30 p.m.; Kaye Playhouse, 68th Street, between Lexington and Park Avenues, (212) 971-9500, littleorchestra.org; $15 and $45. LAUREL GRAEBER"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/movies/movie-listings-for-feb-8-14.html,"Movies Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.★ ‘Amour’ (PG-13, 2:07) A masterpiece about life, death and everything in between, the latest from the great director Michael Haneke (“The White Ribbon,” “Caché”) takes a long, hard, tender look at an elderly French couple, Georges and Anne — played by two titans of French cinema, Jean-Louis Trintignant and Emmanuelle Riva — in their final days. Bring hankies. (Manohla Dargis)★ ‘Anna Karenina’ (R, 2:10) Joe Wright’s version of the Tolstoy novel, with a script by Tom Stoppard, is wildly, sometimes dizzily theatrical, taking place mostly on a series of elaborate stage sets. The story of Anna (Keira Knightley), her humorless husband (Jude Law) and her lover, Count Vronsky (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) becomes a lush melodrama, counterpointed by the delicate romance of Kitty (Alicia Vikander) and Levin (Domhnall Gleeson). Not a faithful adaptation, by any means, but something better: a bold, lively and ardent reimagining of the book. (A. O. Scott)★ ‘Argo’ (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)★ ‘Barbara’ (PG-13; 1:45) Christian Petzold directs this tense, smart film about an East German doctor (Nina Hoss) who, after an unspecified offense, has been banished to the boonies. There, in between hospital rounds and harassment from the secret police, she waits and she burns. (Dargis)‘Broken City’ (R, 1:49) The director Allen Hughes’s latest tale about power and its abuse in the city revolves around the moral education of a cop (Mark Wahlberg) who shoots a man dead and is forced to turn in his badge. (Dargis)‘Bullet to the Head’ (R, 1:31) The veteran action director Walter Hill hasn’t done much to enliven this dull story of a collection of bad, badder and baddest men shooting it out, though he has brought a spark of wit to the proceedings, starting with the figure of Sylvester Stallone. (Dargis)‘The Central Park Five’ (No rating, 1:59) Directed by Ken Burns, David McMahon and Sarah Burns, this documentary revisits the 1989 rape and beating of the white woman known as the Central Park jogger and the five black and Latino teenagers accused of assaulting her. The five were imprisoned but later exonerated; the filmmakers look back at what happened and why. (Dargis)★ ‘Chasing Ice’ (PG-13, 1:16) The timing couldn’t be better for this documentary about the work of James Balog, who set out to provide visual evidence of the effects of global warming by taking time-lapse photographs of melting glaciers. The images are as beautiful as they are important. (Neil Genzlinger)★ ‘Django Unchained’ (R, 2:45) Blaxploitation and spaghetti western meet in the Old South in Quentin Tarantino’s latest provocation, with — literally! — explosive results. Jamie Foxx is Django, a slave freed by a German bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz), whose partner and protégé he becomes. After the two kill off a bunch of bad guys, they set off to free Django’s wife (Kerry Washington) from captivity at a nightmarish plantation called Candyland. Bloody, farcical and cartoonish, “Django Unchained” is at once a wildly entertaining, borderline-irresponsible fantasy and a bold and serious attempt to use the imaginative resources of popular culture to address an old and durable historical injustice. (Scott)★ ‘56 Up’ (No rating, 2:24) The latest installment in Michael Apted’s remarkable documentary project that has followed a group of Britons since 1964, starting when they were 7, checks in on them at 56. (Dargis)★ ‘Flight’  (R, 2:18) A titanic Denzel Washington plays a veteran commercial pilot whose greatest vocation should be his flying but has instead, for various reasons, become his drinking. Robert Zemeckis directs his finest movie since “Cast Away.” (Dargis)‘Gangster Squad’ (R, 1:53) This brainless, hopped-up, ultraviolent Los Angeles noir, directed by Ruben Fleischer, assembles an impressive cast (including Sean Penn, Ryan Gosling, Josh Brolin and Emma Stone) and some spiffy period costumes. (Scott)★ ‘The Gatekeepers’ (PG-13, 1:37) Not recommended for anyone clinging to optimism about the Middle East, this documentary, consisting of interviews with six former heads of Shin Bet, the Israeli security agency, is a devastating and informative anatomy of politics, terrorism and the post-1967 collisions between Zionism and Palestinian nationalism. Recommended for anyone who can handle the truth. (Scott)‘Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters’ (R, 1:41) It’s nice to see something other than a vampire or a zombie on a movie screen, and the witches in this film, directed by Tommy Wirkola, are pretty terrifying. The script, though, could use a bit more wit, and the stars, Jeremy Renner and Gemma Arterton as the grown-up brother and sister from the fairy tale, could use a bit more chemistry. (Genzlinger)‘Happy People: A Year in the Taiga’ (No rating, 1:34, in English and Russian) In “Happy People: A Year in the Taiga,” Werner Herzog airdrops us into the vast Siberian taiga (a sprawling region of subarctic forest) for a seasonal portrait focusing on fur trappers. Rather than Mr. Herzog’s customary foray into the abyss, this film, culled from a Russian television documentary and given a philosophizing voiceover, is a quaint throwback to the illustrated chronicles of television nature documentaries. (Nicolas Rapold)‘A Haunted House’  (R, 1:37) The brand of horror film that features hand-held cameras and found footage probably didn’t need spoofing in the first place, but this clumsy movie tries anyway. It fails, because the writers (Marlon Wayans and Rick Alvarez) and the director (Mike Tiddes) are content with sophomoric humor and lazy story about a couple (Mr. Wayans and Essence Atkins) who decide to move in together. A demon moves in too. (Genzlinger)‘The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey’ (PG-13, 2:50) Peter Jackson’s adaptation of the J. R. R. Tolkien novel — the first in a trilogy of films — is a slick, bloated, lumbering bore, a profit-minded exercise in theme-park-ride cinema that has neither the charm of the book nor the grandeur of Mr. Jackson’s “Lord of the Rings” movies. (Scott)★ ‘Holy Motors’ (No rating, 1:55, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)‘The Impossible’ (PG-13; 1:47) A story of survival set against the Asian tsunami of 2004, about a British family (Ewan McGregor and Naomi Watts are the parents) vacationing in Thailand when disaster strikes. The performances are excellent (Tom Holland, as the couple’s oldest son, is especially strong), and the director, Juan Antonio Bayona, deftly recreates the violence of the killer waves and the desolation they left in their wake. Still, something is troubling about the film’s almost complete neglect of the non-Western victims of the tsunami. This is the story of a very bad holiday rather than of a mass catastrophe. (Scott)‘John Dies at the End’ (R, 1:40) The title of this crazy-quilt, low-budget genre train wreck is less of a spoiler than you might think. Directed by Don Coscarelli (“Bubba Ho-Tep,” the “Phantasm” movies), it tells the story of Dave (Chase Williamson), a small-town loser who confronts a threat to human existence involving visitors from other planets and dimensions, wayward sex toys and a highly addictive hallucinogenic drug known as soy sauce. (Scott)‘Koch’ (No rating, 1:34) Neil Barsky’s portrait of Edward I. Koch, the three-term New York mayor (who died on Feb. 1, the day the movie opened), is affectionate but not uncritical. The film moves back and forth between a condensed history of Mr. Koch’s time in office and visits with him in the fall of 2010, as he campaigns for various candidates, defends his record and revisits old grudges. A personality this large and complicated may require more than 94 minutes, but this documentary is catnip for the nostalgic and the curious. (Scott)‘Life of Pi’ (PG, 2:06) In bringing Yann Martel’s beloved novel to the screen, Ang Lee has created a 3-D digital fable that is often stunning to behold. The middle section, in which the title character and a Bengal tiger share a lifeboat after a shipwreck, is touching and clever, but its delicacy is spoiled by a fuzzy, cloying spiritualism that hangs over everything like a humid cloud. (Scott)★ ‘Lincoln’ (PG-13, 2:29) Daniel Day-Lewis plays the Great Emancipator with playful wit as well as gravity. This film, directed by Steven Spielberg from a bristling, discursive script by Tony Kushner, focuses on Lincoln’s political skills and confines itself mainly to a single momentous month in his presidency. The superb supporting cast (including Sally Field as Mrs. Lincoln and Tommy Lee Jones as the abolitionist firebrand Thaddeus Stevens) helps turn the movie into a group portrait of leadership in crisis. It’s a democratic masterpiece, a history lesson full of historical detail and honest patriotic emotion. (Scott)‘Mama’ (PG-13, 1:49) This ghost story starring Jessica Chastain offers a strong sense of time and place, along with the kind of niceties that don’t often figure into horror flicks, notably pictorial beauty, an atmosphere throbbing with dread and actors so good that you don’t want anyone to take an ax to them. (Dargis)★ ‘The Master’ (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson’s latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)‘Les Misérables’ (PG-13, 2:37) Tom Hooper (“The King’s Speech”) directs this overly busy screen version of the popular musical with Hugh Jackman as the reformed prisoner, Russell Crowe as his tormentor and Anne Hathaway as the prostitute turned martyr. By the grand finale, when tout le monde is waving the French tricolor in victory, you may instead be raising the white flag in exhausted defeat. (Dargis)‘Movie 43’ (R, 2:55) The kindest thing to be said about this star-saturated collection of crude one-joke vignettes made with big-time directors is that most of the participants seem to relish being naughty. (Stephen Holden)‘Mumia: Long Distance Revolutionary’ (No rating, 2:00) This documentary by Stephen Vittoria revisits yet again the case of Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted of killing a Philadelphia police officer three decades ago and who is viewed as a sort of political prisoner by his supporters. The idea is to highlight the writing Mr. Abu-Jamal has been doing in prison, but the film is more effective as simply a reminder that there are outspoken voices on the left as well as on the far right. The ones here include academics like Cornel West and activists like Angela Davis. (Genzlinger)‘Oscar Nominated Short Films 2013’  (no rating; various running times) The strongest short films in three programs — live action, documentary and animation — are mini-dramas set in Kabul, Afghanistan (“Buzkashi Boys”) and Somalia (“Asad”). Both view the world through the eyes of preadolescent boys whose vitality and adventurous spirit mitigates the surrounding misery. The subjects of four of this year’s five documentary shorts include poverty, homelessness, cancer and heart disease, but none could be described as despairing. The animation is a mixed bag. Throughout, a glass-half-full attitude prevails. (Holden)‘Parental Guidance’ (PG, 1:44) Billy Crystal stars as a baseball announcer who, when not being indulged by his wife (Bette Midler), schools his daughter (Marisa Tomei) and grandkids on the right way to do everything. Lisa Addario and Joe Syracuse wrote the script, and Andy Fickman gives it some snap. (Dargis)‘Parker’ (R, 1:58) This blunt and bloody tale of underworld revenge — based on a pseudonymous novel by Donald E. Westlake — stars Jason Statham as the title character, a brilliant thief with a stony sense of honor. He travels to Palm Beach to collect payback from a gang that ripped him off, and the violence of that undertaking is leavened by the screwball almost-romance that unfolds between him and a local real estate agent played by Jennifer Lopez. Taylor Hackford (“An Officer and a Gentleman,” “Ray”) directed, with the unpretentious skill a movie like this requires. (Scott)‘Quartet’ (PG-13, 1:38) A chance to watch vintage British actors in mildly naughty, gently touching circumstances. Dustin Hoffman directed this tale of retired musicians — played by Billy Connolly, Maggie Smith and Tom Courtenay, among others — settling old scores and singing old songs. (Scott)‘Race 2’ (No rating, 2:30, in Hindi) A Bollywood thriller set mostly in Turkey, “Race 2” spends a lot of time ogling wealthy lifestyles and two international men of mystery (Saif Ali Khan and John Abraham). There’s not much fizz in this movie, whose plot goes on and on. So it comes as no surprise when one character asks “What happens next in this race?” The answer is: “Same thing that happened before.” (Rachel Saltz)★ ‘Rust and Bone’ (R, 2:00, in French) Jacques Audiard (“A Prophet,” “The Beat That My Heart Skipped”) directs this tough and tender melodrama with a ferocious conviction that disguises some of its sentimental soft spots. The Belgian actor Matthias Schoenaerts plays Ali, a sometime prizefighter and unreliable father who befriends Stéphanie (Marion Cotillard), a trainer of killer whales trying to recover after a terrible accident. The romance that blossoms between them is sexy and volatile, as are the performances, which are absolutely convincing even when the story is not. (Scott)★ ‘Searching for Sugar Man’ (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul’s hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don’t wait for the DVD. (Dargis)★ ‘The Sessions’ (R, 1:35) The movie couple of the year, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt — re-enacting the true story of a disabled, virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate — infuse this film, directed and written by Ben Lewin, with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor. (Holden)★ ‘Silver Linings Playbook’ (R, 2:00) David O. Russell’s exuberant new comedy tracks the feverish, happy, sad, absurdly funny ups and downs of a head case (Bradley Cooper) just as he returns to his parents’ home after eight months in a mental institution. When he meets a heartbreak beauty (Jennifer Lawrence), he finds fresh purpose in a movie that honks for happiness. (Dargis)★ ‘Skyfall’ (PG-13, 2:23) Directed by a surprisingly suitable Sam Mendes, this latest Bond is a superior follow-up to “Casino Royale,” the 2006 reboot that introduced the excellent Daniel Craig as 007. Playful but never frivolous, it comes off as something of a franchise rethink, partly because it brings in new faces and implies that Bond, like Jason Bourne, needed to be reborn. (Dargis)★ ‘Sound City’  (No rating, 1:46) Dave Grohl of Nirvana and Foo Fighters tries out the director’s chair for this enjoyable documentary about a recording studio in California where some pivotal albums were recorded, including Nirvana’s “Nevermind.” It’s a sweet nostalgia trip, but it’s also a lament for the time when music was recorded on tape rather than digitally and sounded as if actual humans were playing the instruments. (Genzlinger)‘Tabu’ (No rating, 1:58, in Portuguese) The first half of Miguel Gomes’s elegant and elusive black-and-white film concerns a middle-aged woman living alone in present-day Lisbon, who is drawn into the life of her elderly neighbor. The second half tells, without dialogue, the story of that neighbor’s romantic adventures in the last years of Portuguese colonial rule in Africa. The mood of nostalgia — for old movies and for old social arrangements — is beguiling, if also somewhat coy. (Scott)‘This Is 40’ (R; 2:14) Pete and Debbie (Paul Rudd and Leslie Mann) play a Los Angeles married couple in Judd Apatow’s sloppy, generous and deeply personal new film. Facing the anxieties of approaching middle age and other related worries, they squabble, act out and wonder if they can find true happiness amid the almost unimaginable privilege they enjoy. (Scott)‘Warm Bodies’ (PG-13, 1:37) An improbable zombie romance sweetened with appealing performances and buoyed by one of the better cute meets in recent romantic comedy, when the zombie boy, Nicholas Hoult, decides not to eat a live girl, Teresa Palmer. (Dargis)‘Yossi’ (No rating, 1:24, in Hebrew) The sequel to the gay love story, “Yossi and Jagger,” a landmark of Israeli cinema, begins as a reasonably hardheaded look at profound cultural change but turns into a soft feel-good fantasy of romantic salvation. (Holden)★ ‘Zero Dark Thirty’ (R, 2:37) Kathryn Bigelow’s brilliantly directed fictionalized account about the search for Osama bin Laden is a difficult, urgent movie that shows the unspeakable, torture included, and lets us decide if the death of bin Laden was worth the price we paid. Written by Mark Boal, the movie is a seamless weave of truth and drama as well as a wrenchingly sad, soul-shaking story about revenge and its moral costs. See it, fight over it, but don’t ignore it. (Dargis)Film Series‘1933: Hollywood’s Naughtiest, Bawdiest Year’ (Friday through Thursday; through March 7) The last full year of relatively unbridled Hollywood filmmaking before the Production Code was enforced, 1933 continues to represent the American Cinema that might have been, before the women’s clubs and church groups managed to impose their particular values on the industry. As this superbly organized series (by Film Forum’s director of repertory programming, Bruce Goldstein) attests, this was not simply a matter of silk lingerie and risqué situations, though those factors abound in several of the opening weekend films, including Roy Del Ruth’s “Employees’ Entrance” (Friday); Mervyn LeRoy’s “Gold Diggers of 1933” (Saturday); and Ernst Lubitsch’s “Design for Living” (Sunday). This was also a period in which Hollywood was profoundly engaged with the everyday lives of Americans, to a degree it has never attained since: William Wellman’s “Heroes for Sale” (Monday), Alfred E. Green’s “Baby Face” (next Friday) and Wellman’s “Wild Boys of the Road” (March 4) all attest to a social reality that was painfully familiar to audience members at the time. At the same time, escapism flourished with exotic melodramas like Frank Capra’s “Bitter Tea of General Yen” (Tuesday) and Rouben Mamoulian’s “Song of Songs” (Wednesday). Another form of escapism was the nonsense comedy, epitomized by the Marx Brothers in “Duck Soup” and W. C. Fields in “International House” (both screening on Feb. 17). The series includes 66 films, and cinephiles will want to mark their calendars for the ultra-rare screenings of Mitchell Leisen’s first feature, “Cradle Song,” on Feb. 21 and Edward L. Cahn’s “Laughter in Hell” on Feb. 26. Film Forum, 209 West Houston Street, west of Avenue of the Americas, South Village, (212) 727-8110, filmforum.org; $12.50. (Dave Kehr)A Pryor Engagement (Friday through Thursday; through Feb. 21) Richard Pryor’s intensely personal, confessional comedy represented a breakthrough in the stand-up humor of the 1970s, though few of the many Hollywood features he made after fame was his do justice to his originality.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/arts/television/touch-with-kiefer-sutherland-starts-season-2.html,"A year ago, before the premiere of the Fox drama “Touch,” Tim Kring, its creator, was talking about the possibilities inherent in the show’s core relationship, between a father and his mute, somewhat mystical son. As the series progressed, Mr. Kring said, there were lots of things he might do to deepen that relationship. Maybe the boy would even speak at some point.But what has happened to “Touch” goes far beyond the will-he-or-won’t-he-talk question. The two-hour Season 2 premiere on Friday night reveals a series that has become considerably darker and more complex than its earliest episodes suggested. The intricacies may make it harder for new viewers to crack the show without doing some catch-up watching, but they also make it far more absorbing.“Touch” stars Kiefer Sutherland as Martin Bohm, a widower who is struggling to raise his son, Jake, now 11. David Mazouz deserves some kind of prize for his portrayal of Jake (who still, by the way, has not spoken, although his thoughts are heard in voice-over at the beginning and end of episodes). This young actor can get more out of a haunting stare than many adult performers can find in a paragraph’s worth of dialogue.Jake sees patterns in numbers, and early on it seemed as if all Mr. Kring had on his mind was having Jake use that ability to make feel-good connections among disparate people around the globe. But as Season 1 went along, it became apparent that others were interested in Jake’s unusual talent, most notably a malicious corporation called Aster.As the ominous plotlines have emerged, the series has morphed into a suspense drama, with Martin and Jake on the run (Season 2 finds them in Los Angeles rather than New York) and in constant peril.All of that has been for the better. The we’re-all-connected theme is sweet, but by itself it would have grown cloying week after week.Perhaps the best decision, though, was to add Maria Bello in a story arc that began in Season 1 and seems poised to become a focus of Season 2. She plays the mother of another child, Amelia (Saxon Sharbino), with abilities similar to Jake’s. Amelia has apparently been kidnapped by Aster, and Ms. Bello’s character, Lucy, joins with Martin in trying to find her and figure out just what the deal is with these special children.Giving Mr. Sutherland a grown-up to play off pays dividends in the Season 2 premiere and even provides some romantic possibilities, at least for a while. But the double episode also plunges further into mysticism, with Jake’s abilities gaining religious overtones, and not necessarily in an upbeat way. A religious zealot (Saïd Taghmaoui) has some decidedly uncharitable ideas about what should be done to gifted people.“Touch” has a few annoying quirks. For instance, Martin, an otherwise smart guy, never does seem to figure out that if he takes his eye off Jake for more than 30 seconds, the kid will disappear, following a summons only he can hear. Yet another frantic search will result, a gimmick that increasingly feels like filler in this generally rewarding series."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/arts/music/what-to-watch-for-at-the-grammys.html,"NO one dominates the field of contenders for the Grammy Awards this year as Adele did a year ago. And so far there has been little drama leading up to Sunday night’s ceremony that can rival the sudden death of Whitney Houston last year or Adele’s much-talked-about return from vocal surgery.So does this year’s show run the risk of being a snooze? Fear not, music fans, there are plenty of minidramas to watch for that could make the evening’s proceedings, to be broadcast on CBS at 8 p.m. Eastern time from the Staples Center in Los Angeles, interesting.For starters the pop-rock trio Fun. is the first act since Amy Winehouse in 2007 to have a shot at sweeping all four of the prestigious general awards. This Brooklyn group, whose “Some Nights” album spun off the smash hit “We Are Young,” is nominated for record, album and song of the year, as well as best new artist. The only artist in the 55-year history of the awards to win all four awards was Christopher Cross in 1980. (The feat seemed to be a kiss of death for Mr. Cross, whose career has sputtered since.)Can Fun. do it? “It seems like a long shot,” said Nate Ruess, the band’s frontman. The group faces stiff competition for record of the year (which is for a single) from Gotye’s “Somebody That I Used to Know,” the best-selling single of the year. In the contest for song of the year, an award for songwriters, Fun.’s “We Are Young” must outpoll the British newcomer Ed Sheeran, whose song about a drug-addicted prostitute, “The A Team,” was a sleeper hit, and Carly Rae Jepsen’s ubiquitous summer anthem “Call Me Maybe.”Still, Fun. has a fighting chance to take the coveted album of the year award. That contest seems dominated by rock of various flavors — poppy, bluesy, folksy — and is notable more for what is not there than what is. There are no female artists, no pop divas, no rappers, no country crooners.Instead the category has groups heard frequently on alternative rock stations: Mumford & Sons, the Black Keys and Jack White. Mumford & Sons have yet to win a Grammy, even though their stomping folk style has spearheaded a revival of folk-rock. The Black Keys and Jack White both produced howling blues-rock records that typically do well with Grammy voters.The last contender is Frank Ocean, the R&B singer whose debut solo album, “Channel Orange,” was on many critics’ Top 10 lists for the year. Mr. Ocean gained importance as a public figure when he broke an unspoken code in the R&B world and announced before the album was released that his first love had been a man.“Frank Ocean has become a really strong dark-horse pick,” said Bill Werde, editorial director of Billboard. “He’s a fashionable artist in the music business these days, because he has that great mix of critical respect and commercial appeal.”Also nominated in the album and song of the year categories, Mr. Ocean will probably be Fun.’s closest rival in the best new artist category as well. Two of the other hopefuls for that prize are darlings of the alt-rock world: the folksy Lumineers and the R&B-inflected Alabama Shakes. Hunter Hayes, a country wunderkind, rounds out the list. “It’s beyond flattering,” Mr. Ruess said. “Win or lose it’s just great and cool to be nominated with that group.”Another closely watched artist will be Nas, the veteran New York rapper, who has never won a Grammy, despite nine previous nominations and six No. 1 albums that each sold more than a million copies, starting with the classic “Illmatic” back in 1994. This could be the year the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences, which bestows the Grammys, finally recognizes his contributions. He is nominated in every rap category — song, album, rap-sung collaboration (with Amy Winehouse) and performance — for his album “Life Is Good,” which explored middle-age themes like fatherhood and divorce.So it is possible that this 39-year-old rapper could sweep the category, though he will face challenges in the best album contest from Drake’s “Take Care” and the Roots’ “Undun,” as well as new albums by Rick Ross and 2 Chainz.“Everyone is looking for Nas to get what he deserves rightfully as an artist,” said Chuck Creekmur, the founder of AllHipHop.com. “This album is a deeply personal album, and a lot of people have seen his struggles over the years.”Neither Nas nor Drake made the cut for album of the year, however. Historically the Recording Academy’s voters have shied away from giving the top album honor to rap artists, the only exceptions being Lauryn Hill in 1999 and OutKast in 2004. Kanye West has won 18 Grammys, but they have all been in the rap field, a fact about which he has complained publicly.“You can look at the results and see that voters are mostly comfortable with pop and pop rock and less so with hip-hop,” said Paul Grein, a pop music writer for Yahoo who tracks the Grammys closely. “They need to overcome their resistance to rap, because it’s here, and it’s an essential part of pop music.”Adele, who won six Grammys last year for her blockbuster “21,” is not completely out of this year’s competition. She has a chance to become the first female soloist to win back-to-back Grammys in the pop field since Barbra Streisand did so in the 1960s. That’s because her live version of “Set Fire to the Rain” was released late enough to qualify for this year’s cycle and is nominated for best female pop vocal performance. She will have to best Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Rihanna and Ms. Jepsen.One of the hottest contests will be for best contemporary urban album, a close three-way race among Mr. Ocean’s “Channel Orange,” Chris Brown’s “Fortune,” and Miguel’s “Kaleidoscope Dream.” Mr. Ocean and Miguel’s albums were both acclaimed by critics, and each can lay claim to having reinvented for a new generation the sort of music Marvin Gaye pioneered. Mr. Brown’s album, which was dance oriented, was a commercial success, reaching the top of Billboard’s R&B chart.The competition took on personal overtones last week when Mr. Ocean and Mr. Brown got involved in a brawl over a parking space outside a recording studio in Los Angeles. Mr. Ocean, who suffered a cut on his finger, threatened to press charges then changed his mind. It was a merciful act, since Mr. Brown is still serving five years’ probation for beating and choking his girlfriend, the pop diva Rihanna, just before the Grammys back in 2009; a new criminal charge could have derailed his career.Adding to the drama, Rihanna, who is nominated this year for best pop solo performance, announced in the current issue of Rolling Stone that she has forgiven Mr. Brown and has resumed dating him, even though it might send a questionable message to young female fans. “Even if it’s a mistake, it’s my mistake,” she said.Mr. Ocean’s decision to drop charges was not the end of Mr. Brown’s legal troubles, however. This week he went before a judge in Los Angeles to answer an allegation from prosecutors there that he had failed to complete six months of community service in his home state, Virginia, that was part of his sentence for assaulting Rihanna, turning in false time sheets. An assistant district attorney asked the court to compel Mr. Brown to redo the sentence in Los Angeles, as Rihanna sat in the front row and blew kisses to Mr. Brown.The judge put off a decision until a hearing on April 5. So Mr. Brown will be able to attend the Grammys, raising the question: Will the couple attend the ceremony together? And might they perform a duet?On the jazz front genre mashing has become the rage with young musicians, and the Grammys reflect that this year. The pianist Robert Glasper’s album “Black Radio” was one of the biggest stories in jazz last year, a melding of acoustic jazz with hip-hop and soul music elements. He’s nominated for two awards, but neither of them in the jazz field. Grammy voters put “Black Radio” on the list for best performance and best album in the R&B category. That decision reflects a vital trend in jazz, as young artists like Mr. Glasper, Esperanza Spalding and José James are infusing their jazz with other genres.The best dance recording category has a dark horse candidate: Al Walser, an obscure producer from Liechtenstein who managed to get on the ballot by wooing members of the Recording Academy directly through its social-networking Web site, Grammy 365. He is competing against the usual list of top-flight D.J.’s: Skrillex, Calvin Harris, Avicii and Swedish House Mafia. But if Mr. Walser wins, it could encourage other B-list artists to start online lobbying efforts.The Latin jazz category has been reinstated this year, just a year after the trustees cut it and sparked a storm of protest. And Bobby Sanabria, a drummer who led the successful campaign to restore the category, is reaping the rewards. His band’s “Multiverse” is nominated for best Latin jazz album. “It is funny,” he said. “It will be a lot better being inside than standing outside with a picket sign.” He added, “What I’m really happy about is this category came back so this marginalized form of American music can get more light shed on it.”The bluegrass field seldom gets much attention. This year the Chicago banjo master Greg Cahill is up against his former pupil Noam Pikelny, the banjoist with Punch Brothers. Mr. Pikelny, who currently lives in Brooklyn, is nominated for his solo release “Beat the Devil and Carry a Rail.” Mr. Cahill’s Chicago group, Special Consensus, is nominated for the release “Scratch Gravel Road.” Mr. Pikelny started studying with Mr. Cahill as a teenager and still considers him a mentor.Ravi Shankar, the sitar player who died in December at 92, is not only to receive a posthumous lifetime achievement award from the Recording Academy but also is nominated in the best world music album category for “The Living Room Sessions, Part 1.” That would be strange enough, if his daughter Anoushka Shankar was not also nominated in the same category for her album “Traveller.” His other musically talented daughter, Nora Jones, is not nominated this year.For the first time a soundtrack for a video game has been nominated for a Grammy Award in the category usually reserved for movie scores. The composer Austin Wintory, 28, who wrote the ethereal music for the PlayStation 3 game “Journey,” has been given a nod, pitting him against film-score giants like John Williams, Ludovic Bource, Hans Zimmer and Howard Shore.The Americana category, which has only been around three years, is one to watch. Competing for best album are a collection of young string bands that have surged to the top of the rock and alternative charts over the last year, heading a revival of folk-rock: Mumford & Sons, the Lumineers and the Avett Brothers. All three are looking for their first Grammy. Added to the mix is Bonnie Raitt’s acclaimed album “Slipstream” and a little-known fingerpicking song man named John Fullbright.“There is definitely something going on with Americana at the Grammy level,” said Jed Hilly, the executive director of the Americana Music Association. “The Grammys are a little more representative of the mainstream.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/world/middleeast/iran-tv-shows-video-it-says-came-from-us-drone.html,"In what Iran is calling a new demonstration of its military advances, state television has broadcast clips from what was described as encrypted video footage extracted from the camera of an unarmed American surveillance drone, which was seized in Iranian territory in December 2011.The seizure of the drone, a sophisticated batwinged RQ-170 Sentinel model that had been based in neighboring Afghanistan and run by the C.I.A., was an embarrassment for the United States, which said the aircraft had crashed in Iran because of a technical malfunction.Iran has said its military fooled the drone’s avionics system into a guided landing 140 miles from the Afghan border, and has since claimed to have reverse-engineered the aircraft’s secrets.The broadcast on Wednesday included aerial views of what the narration described as the American air base in Kandahar, Afghanistan, supposedly taken by the drone; still photographs of the RQ-170 Sentinel at that base made public in 2011; and images of the Iranian military recovering the craft.The broadcast also featured an interview with Gen. Amir Ali Hajizadeh, identified as the head of the aerospace division of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps, who said, “We were able to definitively access the data of the drone, once we brought it down,” according to a translation by The Associated Press.In another portion of the interview, General Hajizadeh said that when the Iranians realized the value of what they had seized, they considered the possibility that the United States would initiate a sabotage mission, most likely an airstrike, to destroy the drone. He said Iran’s military strategists had ruled out the possibility of a raid by American commandos because “they would have been captured and created bigger problems for the U.S.,” according to a translation by the semiofficial Mehr News Agency.After initially denying Iran’s claims to have seized the drone on Dec. 4, 2011, the United States confirmed that it had been lost. President Obama even acknowledged that the Americans had asked Iran to return it, a request Iran rejected. The Iranian military later put it on public display.More footage said to have been recorded by the drone can be seen in a copy of the 24-minute Iranian report posted on YouTube by Lenziran, a site that monitors Iranian media.In another assertion of military advances, the Fars News Agency, which is close to the Revolutionary Guards, claimed Thursday that Iran had also started to produce functional copies of a smaller, American ScanEagle surveillance drone it had displayed on state television in December. The Fars report quoted Deputy Defense Minister Mohammad Eslami as saying that the country had also established a “production line for the drones in foreign countries.”"

Ms. Wainwright, a member of the genetically blessed McGarrigle-Wainwright musical clan, is a confessional folk-rock scribe of reedy, quiet strength. Her live covers disc, “Sans Fusils, Ni Souliers, à Paris: Martha Wainwright’s Piaf Record” (V2), revealed prodigious abilities for jazz crooning as well.

(Anderson)Hospitality (Sunday) “Friends of Friends,” the breakthrough single for this Brooklyn indie-pop trio, is a winsome blend of chirping vocals and deft guitar trills. The rest of the group’s self-titled, Merge-released debut, however, is an earthier set of fables about lost loves and frustrating careers, anchored in feathery guitars that turn torrid in a flash.

Her bel canto technique may not be flawless, but Ms. Netrebko conveys the dilemma of a feisty farm owner drawn to a bungling villager, Nemorino, an endearing portrayal by the excellent tenor Matthew Polenzani.

The Duke, a Frank Sinatra-like headliner, is the de facto monarch on the strip. Rigoletto, a court jester in the original, is some kind of hanger-on in the Duke’s entourage, but his character is left frustratingly undefined. The excellent cast includes the baritone Zeljko Lucic, who brings poignancy, fervor and mellow vocal colorings to the title role; the bright, ardent tenor Piotr Beczala makes a brash and licentious Duke; and the charismatic soprano Diana Damrau, in lustrous voice, is a vulnerable Gilda. The rising young Italian conductor Michele Mariotti draws a stylish, textured and supple performance from the cast, the chorus and the great Met orchestra.

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/08/arts/music/mumford-sons-at-the-barclays-center.html,"A few songs into Mumford & Sons sold-out show at the Barclays Center on Wednesday night, the group played “Hopeless Wanderer,” from its second album, “Babel” (Glassnote), which was released last year. Like many of the band’s songs, this one began delicately, with Ben Lovett, the group’s keyboardist, set up at a piano and leading the arrangement, until the song shifted to a roar a couple of minutes in. There was no going back from there. The sound remained intense, manic, dizzying, ending with what felt like the sort of heaving gasp an Olympic sprinter collapses into following the 100 meter finals.Marcus Mumford, the frontman, took a second, then told the crowd, “We’re going to play a quiet song now.”That was “Timshel,” from the group’s debut album, in 2009, “Sigh No More,” which began whisperlike, Mr. Mumford singing in soothing harmony with the rest of the band: “Death is at your doorstep/And it will steal your innocence/But it will not steal your substance.”Right about then one hoarse fan delivered his verdict, at top volume:“Awesommmmme!”Do not turn down the bro-folk; at least, that appeared to be the message being delivered to a band that has thrived on such collisions, even if it might not always be thrilled about them. Sometimes the direction of a band is determined not just by its members but also by its crowd.Mumford & Sons are one of the true music-industry success stories of the last few years — a rare multiplatinum act in a time of emaciated record sales, an ascendant rock group in a post-rock era, a band that prioritizes the acoustic and the organic in an age of the digitally manipulated. And it’s been rewarded. The group is nominated in six categories at the 55th Annual Grammy Awards, which will take place on Sunday.Mumford & Sons are succeeding by filling holes that few others have sought to fill, which may say more about the holes than the band. Whether by fiat or by attrition, it is what stands in for hard rock these days.Certainly loud post-grunge bands still cling by their fingertips at major labels and tour to fewer fans each year. But if you want to be rocked hard by a youngish band in an arena of Barclays size in 2013, Mumford & Sons and their banjo will be doing the rocking.And yes, rock they did. Considering that Mumford & Sons are effectively an acoustic foursome — Mr. Mumford, Mr. Lovett, the bassist Ted Dwane and the banjo player Winston Marshall — this was an astonishingly loud concert, much as this group’s albums can get brutally loud.For most of the show Mr. Mumford, who plays guitar, was also pounding out a simple beat on a kick drum with his right foot — boom, boom, boom, boom. It was a call to attention, a sign of authority, a virtual parody of handmade culture. (If that wasn’t enough, on a few songs, he used his left foot to strike a tambourine.)The drum’s hollow punch is one of the elements that increases this band’s legibility. Mumford & Sons also structure their songs in a classically pop manner, though their tool kit, from Mr. Marshall’s aggressive banjo to the crescendoing horn section, is novel. Considering that the songs center on unrepentantly dark themes — call it rustic gothic — they maintain an almost physical optimism. “Holland Road,” the surprising hit “The Cave,” even “Little Lion Man” with its proud profanity: all wrangle brightness from the dark.Sometimes the group was joined by a troika of horn players, or a fiddler, cellist, drummer and extra guitar player, or sometimes all of the above. But a not insignificant portion of the show was just the band’s core four, harmonizing intensely and playing their instruments with ferocity. At one point Mr. Marshall stomped on one of his pedals so hard it toppled over and slid away from him.Mumford & Sons are among a handful of British bands of recent vintage taking an elastic approach to American roots music (remember Fanfarlo?), though why it took a British band inspired by the “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” soundtrack to successfully repackage roots music for American audiences is still something of a mystery. No American band has come close, not even friendly, tepid ones like the Avett Brothers, or roots-leaning jam bands (or jam-leaning roots bands) like the Infamous Stringdusters, Old Crow Medicine Show, or Yonder Mountain String Band, many of which are popular, but none of which are pop. That scene has its comforts, undoubtedly, but ones that bands the size of Mumford & Sons can’t always hold on to.For the first of the night’s two encores the band re-emerged on a tiny stage at the back of the arena and sang, with little amplification, into one microphone. It was meant to be a reverent moment, a hypertrophied version of the extremely loud quiet that the foursome had been delivering on the big stage all night.They began to sing, and many in the crowd started shushing their peers, until the big hall was still. But not 20 seconds passed before a disrupting harangue came from a fan, who shouted, “I can’t heeeaaar youuuu.” Cool story, bro."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/arts/music/orchestra-of-st-lukes-at-carnegie-hall.html,"In recent years the orchestra world has been galvanized by two exciting conductors in their 30s: Gustavo Dudamel and Yannick Nézet-Séguin. Before long people may be talking about another conductor in that age bracket: the Spaniard Pablo Heras-Casado, 35, who led an impressive concert with the Orchestra of St. Luke’s at Carnegie Hall on Thursday night.He began with Beethoven’s “Egmont” Overture, striding to the podium, all boyish, curly-haired and eager. He drew crisp and textured playing from the orchestra. The performance had musical depth and character, not just élan and excitement.Mr. Heras-Casado first conducted the Orchestra of St. Luke’s at the Caramoor Festival in the summer of 2011, and was named the ensemble’s principal conductor that fall. Among its many activities the orchestra offers a handful of symphonic programs each season at Carnegie Hall and the Caramoor Festival.This probably suits Mr. Heras-Casado, since his wide-ranging interests include conducting Renaissance choral groups and performing in contemporary-music festivals.For all his charisma, Mr. Heras-Casado seems by nature a substantive musician not out to wow audiences, as this intriguing program made clear. Following the Beethoven overture, the distinguished German pianist Christian Zacharias, equally known as a conductor, was soloist in Chopin’s Piano Concerto No. 2 in F minor. The two Chopin concertos are like ingenious piano pieces with orchestral backdrops. There is little for a conductor to do but provide support for the pianist and make Chopin’s orchestral writing seem less awkward than it is.In this deeply personal concerto Chopin wrote a piano part suffused in lyrical invention, harmonic richness and contrapuntal intricacy. Mr. Zacharias emphasized the subtlety of the music in his soft-spoken and eloquent performance. Now and then I wanted more bite, more sound, just a bit of showiness. Still, this was a sensitive and intelligent rendition, ably complemented by Mr. Heras-Casado and the orchestra.When I first saw that this program would offer five Debussy preludes for piano in arrangements by the composer Hans Zender, completed in 1991, I thought this was cheating on Mr. Heras-Casado’s part. Why not play a new work instead of a novelty? Besides, I love the Debussy preludes as piano pieces.But these are brilliant arrangements, with daring use of percussion, including mallet instruments and, in “Général Lavine-eccentric,” a bowed saw. (Does the saw count as a percussion instrument?)In the arrangement of “Voiles” (“Sails”), Mr. Zender brings clarity to textures that are hazy on the piano, so the arrangement is also a kind of commentary. All in all, this suite of preludes in these arrangements did sound like something new.Mr. Heras-Casado ended with Schumann’s Symphony No. 4 in D minor, not the familiar and heavily revised version the composer completed in 1851, but the little-heard 1841 original that he withdrew after its disastrous first performance. In this version some of the tempos are faster, the orchestration is lighter, and transitions between certain sections and movements are more elaborate. The piece comes across as an episodic symphonic essay.Mr. Heras-Casado led a luminous and urgent performance, deftly balancing the shifts from moody ruminations to bouts of exuberance. There are many symphonies he could have chosen had he wanted to make a big impression. Instead he offered the audience a fascinating excursion. Mr. Heras-Casado is the thinking person’s idea of a hotshot young conductor."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/arts/design/creating-reality-by-andy-kaufman-at-maccarone.html,"When Andy Kaufman, the entertainer, so-called anti-comic and Elvis impersonator extraordinaire, died in 1984 at 35, he left behind two very distinct if connected personas.The better known is Andy Kaufman, the television star who provided some of the funniest moments on the popular sitcom “Taxi” in the guise of the loopy auto mechanic Latka Gravas, he of the high-pitched voice, unidentifiable accent and alternate sense of reality. As Latka, Kaufman appeared on all five seasons of “Taxi” (1978 to 1983); it brought him fame, financial independence and a television special. (This was stipulated in his first contract.) But Kaufman didn’t like the sitcom format and agreed to stay on the show only when the writers allowed Latka to develop multiple-personality disorder so he could play other characters.The second persona is Andy Kaufman, the stand-up innovator, politically incorrect satirist and cult figure revered by comedians and artists alike — an artist in his own right. This Kaufman, who had been obsessed since childhood with professional wrestling, invited women to wrestle with him onstage, to the outrage of many feminists. He behaved unpredictably on talk shows, often leaving his hosts semi-flummoxed. He led perplexed audiences in grade-school-like singalongs and once invited the audience members at the Improv in New York to touch a cyst on his neck, albeit only after they washed their hands. Following his ineffably odd evening “Andy Kaufman Plays Carnegie Hall,” he took the entire audience for milk and cookies.If audiences became disgruntled by his failure to amuse, he might burst into tears, his cries and shrieks becoming increasingly incoherent and rhythmic until he suddenly started expertly accompanying his vocals on conga drums. He often seemed like a straight man with no partner. His ineffective jokes and weird stunts are seen as an offshoot of Conceptual art, performance art and the interactive strategies of relational aesthetics.The second Kaufman is the subject of “On Creating Reality, by Andy Kaufman,” an engrossing, idiosyncratic exhibition at the Maccarone gallery in the West Village. Latka is nowhere in sight. The show has been organized by the artist Jonathan Berger, who makes the relational aesthetics reference in the news release.Also according to the news release, Mr. Berger collaborated with the estate of Andy Kaufman; Lynne Margulies, Kaufman’s companion; Bob Zmuda, Kaufman’s frequent partner in crime (he usually refereed the wrestling bouts); and Tony Clifton, a repulsive lounge singer whose existence remains wrapped in ambiguity. (Thought to be a Kaufman creation based on a real person, he was impersonated by Kaufman; his brother, Michael Kaufman; and Mr. Zmuda during Kaufman’s lifetime and has made periodic appearances since Kaufman’s death, including at the after-party of the opening at Maccarone.) And in a brilliant stroke, Mr. Berger has made the show deliberately interactive — relational — in a way that feels like a curatorial invention.It comes in two parts, set in separate spaces: Kaufman’s stuff and his art. The main gallery at Maccarone is arrayed with 17 white vitrines with hairpin legs evoking 1950s Long Island, where Kaufman grew up. They display a fascinating range of ephemera and personal effects: letters, childhood poetry, scripts, unpublished novels, press clippings and photographs, tour schedules, props and costumes.In a sense this material forms a study in young, self-aware ambition, a portrait of an artist operating from a personal inner reality, in place since childhood, striving to create a larger reality that conforms to it. The envelope containing Kaufman’s 11th-grade report card is scrawled with an unusual note from a teacher: “I just don’t know Andy.”Two vitrines contain his collections of 45s and LPs; another is piled with letters from women, some denouncing his “intergender wrestling” contests, others threatening him and still others hoping to participate. Kaufman’s involvement with Transcendental Meditation is covered; the prosthetics and jacket that he and Mr. Zmuda used when impersonating Tony Clifton are displayed. Also here: a letter Kaufman wrote to Elvis Presley in 1969, in which he says that he is studying “to be a famous TV personality” and describes Presley as “out of sight — not just in surface, but in depth.” Kaufman’s rhinestone-studded, satin-lined, high-collared “Elvis” shirt shares a vitrine with the sports jacket and rip-off shirt and tie that Foreign Man, the inept, squeaky-voiced comic precursor to Latka, would shed as he morphed into the smoky-voiced, swivel-hipped Elvis.The rapidity of Kaufman’s rise is summed up with an immaculate yellow Post-it from around 1975, on which is written the name and phone number of the NBC executive Dick Ebersol , and the words “call collect.” Mr. Ebersol subsequently became disenchanted with Kaufman; it was in 1982, during Mr. Ebersol’s year as stand-in producer of “Saturday Night Live,” that Kaufman was voted off the show in an unusual viewer poll; it was a serious blow to his career and his ego.While every item on view is carefully numbered, there are no labels. Instead, you get a form of oral history that may, like Kaufman’s performances, make you slightly uncomfortable. Mr. Berger has arranged for a Kaufman colleague, friend or relative to be present each day to answer questions and reminisce.These guests, who are not announced ahead of time, include Mr. Zmuda, Tony Clifton, Michael Kaufman and Carol Kaufman-Kerman (the artist’s sister) and his biographer Bill Zehme. A round table and several chairs, not unlike the set of a television talk show, encourage interaction, which is essential to a full experience of the show.In Maccarone’s new project space, you can view Kaufman’s art and see some of the costumes and props from the vitrines in use. Mainly you will see the unorthodox, versatile talent behind it all. The video segments include appearances at the Improv in New York and on David Letterman’s and Johnny Carson’s shows; an interview with one of the Tony Cliftons as well as skits from “The Andy Kaufman Special” and “Andy Kaufman Plays Carnegie Hall.” In an appearance on Dinah Shore’s show, he sits at the piano delivering a childish song, while Marvin Hamlisch, Sammy Davis Jr. and Bob Hope look on, more or less cringing.Concurrent with the Maccarone show, “Andy Kaufman’s 99cent Tour,” 10 evenings of screenings and discussions, will be held at Participant Inc. on East Houston Street, starting on Tuesday. Organized by Mr. Berger and Lia Gangitano, the director of this alternative space, it will present Kaufman’s television special and the Carnegie Hall evening in their entirety; show some Kaufman family movies; and delve into his record collection and his interest in professional wrestling.Each evening will be overseen by some of the same aficionados appearing at Maccarone, as well as the artists Dan Graham, Mike Smith and David Robbins (Mr. Robbins will appear in a video introduction). The Participant news release features a photograph that should have been at Maccarone: it shows a teenage Kaufman, honing his Elvis impersonation at the birthday party of a 5-year-old named Jeff Citrin, around 1964."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/us/in-a-commercial-a-tacit-acceptance-of-islam-in-america.html,"On a Sunday afternoon several months ago, I was engaged in one of my favorite religious rituals, watching pro football on television. During a break in the game, I reflexively clicked the “mute” button on the remote control. But my eyes stayed fixed on a startling commercial.The screen showed a balding man with tawny skin and a salt-and-pepper goatee, and seconds later it spelled out his name: Mujahid Abdul-Rashid. The advertisement went on to show him fishing, playing in a yard with two toddlers, and sitting down to a family meal.One week later, again during an N.F.L. game, the same commercial appeared. This time I listened to the words. The advertisement was for Prudential’s financial products for retirees. Mr. Abdul-Rashid was talking about his own retirement after 19 years as a clothing salesman, and the family time he now intended to enjoy.“That’s my world,” he said over that closing shot of the family dinner.What I had just seen was something rare and laudable: what seems to be the first mass-market product commercial featuring an identifiably Muslim person not as a security risk, not as a desert primitive, but as an appealing, everyday American.As if to underscore the point, the Prudential commercial with Mr. Abdul-Rashid was appearing on television during the same period last fall that saw two widespread commercial campaigns vilifying Muslims. One was the series of ads on New York subways and buses placed by a group led by Pamela Geller, the outspoken blogger and critic of Islam, which depicted a worldwide conflict between the civilized West and Islamic “savages.” The other was the billboard during the presidential campaign that showed President Obama submissively kissing the hand of a sheik.Then, during the Super Bowl last weekend, a Coca-Cola commercial trotted out the stereotype of the Arab on camelback. As points of comparison, consider that Frito-Lay retired its “Frito Bandito” caricature more than 40 years ago. And in 1989, Quaker Oats removed Aunt Jemima’s kerchief and gave her pearl earrings so she no longer evoked a house slave.I was intrigued enough by the Prudential commercial to find Mr. Abdul-Rashid. Like the other nine people in the campaign, he is an actual person, not a hired performer. And as his name implies, he is Muslim, an African-American born in Los Angeles who converted to Islam in 1980.Mr. Abdul-Rashid, who does some acting on the side, first heard about the Prudential job through a search for recent retirees that was picked up by an e-mail list for actors in the Bay Area, where he lives. He made it through several rounds of interviews to be selected for the series of “Day One Stories,” as the campaign was called. His spot had its debut during “60 Minutes” on CBS in November 2011, and has played about 130 times since then on networks like the History Channel and ESPN. Adweek magazine saluted the commercial with one of its “Ad of the Day” designations.Nobody from Prudential or from Droga5, the agency that created the “Day One Stories,” ever asked Mr. Abdul-Rashid about his religion. Nor does the commercial show him in any religious activity. Still, for any sensate viewer, his name alone attests to his Muslim identity.“I’d never thought about the ad in those terms, because the thrust of the commercial had nothing to do with my religion whatsoever,” Mr. Abdul-Rashid, 61, said. “You saw an African-American family interacting and then my name at the end. But one day I went to a mosque in Oakland with my friend, and the imam said, ‘This is good, it lets people know we are the mainstream.’ ”Mr. Abdul-Rashid’s first name, given to him by a Saudi Arabian teacher with whom he studied Islam before converting, is the kind of thing the Pamela Gellers of the world could have waved like a flag. Even some of Mr. Abdul-Rashid’s theater colleagues suggested after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, that maybe he would be wise to change his name. He refused.“The name Mujahid means someone who strives to live in the way of God,” he said. “And, yes, it means holy warrior, too. But if you ask me, that means fighting the good fight. If you see a hungry person and feed him, that’s fighting holy war. The greatest holy war is within ourselves.”Not being an advertising specialist, I consulted several experts to hear their view of the Prudential commercial. They concurred on its uniqueness and importance.“It expands our idea of the American Dream and it gives us a new way of looking at it,” said Timothy Malefyt, a professor of marketing at Fordham University who worked in the advertising industry for 15 years. “This guy shares our ideals, our fears. He talks about his work ethic, his love of family. Right away, you can see he’s Muslim. So he’s different from us, but he’s also like us. This lets us reevaluate American Muslim identity.”The ad struck Nazia Du Bois, the director of global cultural strategy for Ogilvy & Mather, as singular in the American market. “I can’t think of any other ad as bold, as brave, as this,” she said in an interview. Amplifying her point in an e-mail, she wrote, “This commercial demonstrates an enlightened definition of what it means to be American. It does this by broadening the definition of the American ‘everyman.’ ”If you want a delightful postscript, try this: Mr. Abdul-Rashid, with more time for theater as a retiree, is performing in an acclaimed revival of August Wilson’s play “Gem of the Ocean” in San Diego.But there’s a more depressing footnote, too. When I contacted Prudential for comment about the commercial, the company repeatedly declined to speak. Its vice president for global communications, Deborah Meany, asserted in an e-mail that Prudential had no idea Mr. Abdul-Rashid was Muslim.An aphorism says that no good deed shall go unpunished.

But just days before the film opened, Shirley Povich, a Washington Post columnist, called reports that O’Doul had succeeded in his work “a heap of hokum.” Instead, he wrote, “everything you see Cooper doing left-handed in the picture, he’s actually doing right-handed.”The effect was achieved, he said, through trickery. Cooper would hit, catch and throw right-handed, but the film would be reversed to make it look as if he were a left-hander. To perpetuate the illusion, Cooper would run to third base on a hit, not first, and would station himself at third instead of first. The letters across the chest of his Yankees uniform would be sewn backward.Everything, Povich said, “worked out beautifully.”Now, more than 70 years later, one researcher believes that reports by Povich and others about the cinematic sleight of hand were largely untrue but that a small amount of flipping probably took place. The researcher said that O’Doul’s tutelage probably enabled Cooper, who was 40 when the film was made, to bat and catch left-handed with passable skill, although throwing was another matter.“O’Doul knew a lot about teaching baseball,” said the researcher, Tom Shieber, a senior curator at the National Baseball Hall of Fame. “You can’t sell Cooper short. I heard he wasn’t much of an athlete, but if you look at his swing, it had a funny loop to it, but it wasn’t bad.”Shieber began analyzing the film last month and ended up spelling out his conclusions in a lengthy article early this week on his personal blog, BaseballResearcher.blogspot.com.As he pored over the film’s frames, Shieber began to see how difficult it would have been for the director Sam Wood and the film’s technicians to execute all the changes needed on the field for the film to be successfully reversed.All the players in the shot with Cooper would have had to have the letters on their jerseys sewn backward to be read correctly when the film was flipped.If Cooper wore a glove on the opposite hand, the other infielders would have had to do so, too. And if the first-base running lane was erased, an exact replica would have had to be drawn down third base.Too many dominoes had to fall for the trickery to be worth the filmmakers’ trouble, Shieber said. “Like a complicated conspiracy theory, every aspect of the plan would have to have been carefully planned out and perfectly executed,” he wrote.With an expertise in assessing the authenticity of historic uniforms, Shieber concluded that Cooper’s Columbia University jersey in the movie “buttons together such that the left portion of the shirt placket is on top of the right,” which is common for men’s shirts. The same holds true of the way Cooper’s Yankee jersey buttoned.Shieber even compared the fly of Cooper and Gehrig’s road uniform pants: they lay the same way, left side over right. If Cooper’s fly followed the correct pattern, Shieber said, the film was not flipped.Another clue in Shieber’s research was the bat in Gehrig’s hands: the “Powerized” logo above the Louisville Slugger brand name was angled correctly. Does anyone believe, he asked, that the filmmakers ordered backward-branded bats for the film?“Why go to all that trouble?” he said.Unlike Kevin Costner, who played well in “Bull Durham,” Cooper was a novice. But “Pride of the Yankees” relied far less, relatively, on his athleticism than on the love story between Cooper and Teresa Wright, who portrayed Gehrig’s wife, Eleanor.O’Doul built Cooper’s swing by having him chop trees, but he told Cooper, “You throw a ball like an old woman tossing a hot biscuit.” Years later, Cooper wrote that after “some painful weeks, he got my arm to work in a reasonable duplicate of Gehrig’s throwing.”As for the flipping that probably did occur, Shieber said he noticed that the bandage that was seen on Cooper’s left hand while throwing looked quite similar to a bandage on his right hand as he adjusted his cap, apparent evidence that that part of the film was flipped. In another sequence, Shieber saw that Cooper’s jersey buttoned the wrong way — right placket over left — an indication of more flipping.Shieber acknowledged that more flipping may have been left on the cutting room floor or that the filmmakers may have taken a shot at reversing all of Cooper’s playing sequences before it “got too unruly.”Cooper’s own words, in a 1956 Saturday Evening Post article, dispute Shieber’s findings. He wrote that he knew the difficulties of playing the left-handed Gehrig but that a solution had been found.“To remedy this in close-ups,” he wrote, “the letters on my uniform were reversed as in mirror writing, and the film was processed with the back side to the front. My right hand thus appeared to be my left.”Was Cooper exaggerating?Maria Cooper Janis, Cooper’s daughter, backs her father. “My mother told me that he tried like the dickens to do it as a lefty,” she said by phone. “But he couldn’t.”Shieber’s conclusion, though, may create some renewed, and welcome, curiosity about a movie now 71 years old."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/arts/music/ken-ehrlich-the-man-behind-the-grammy-awards-show.html,"LOS ANGELES — Something was wrong with the video playing behind the R&B singer Frank Ocean as he rehearsed this week for Sunday’s Grammy Awards. The video was projected on a screen behind Mr. Ocean and onto a three-sided box around the keyboard in front of him, creating the surreal illusion that he was running down a desert road while he sang. But the images were slightly out of sync with the recorded track over which Mr. Ocean vocalized: his torso and his legs didn’t quite line up. Rather than dreamy, the effect was disjointed.“It doesn’t work,” one producer growled, as Mr. Ocean ambled offstage to look at a playback. Ken Ehrlich, the executive producer, who was in front of the video monitors as Mr. Ocean sat down, said calmly, “We’re about two-thirds of the way there.”Over the next few minutes, Mr. Ehrlich had the keyboard moved over slightly, so that Mr. Ocean’s torso would line up with his legs, and sent his staff scurrying to find a way to synchronize the sound and the images. Then he went over the performance shot by shot with Mr. Ocean; when Mr. Ocean complained that his face was not visible, Mr. Ehrlich led him to the master control room to talk to the director, Louis J. Horvitz, about working in more close-ups and other angles.The next run-through was exponentially better, and everyone breathed a sigh of relief. As Mr. Ocean was finishing up, an aide rushed up to Mr. Ehrlich to say that Bruno Mars and Rihanna had not yet arrived to rehearse the next segment. Rihanna was still 15 minutes away. “Is that a real 15 or a Rihanna 15?” Mr. Ehrlich asked with a smile.Mr. Ehrlich, 70, has been producing the Grammy Awards show for 33 years, and over that period he has become known for making the three-and-a-half-hour show into a forum for collaborations, historic reunions and spectacles that are perhaps unimaginable anywhere else. Sometimes these collaborations can help a band to rise. Two years ago Mr. Ehrlich put Mumford & Sons, who were then obscure, onstage with Bob Dylan, and this year that group is nominated for six Grammys.In recent years Mr. Ehrlich and the Recording Academy have reduced the number of awards presented and packed the show with more and more performances aimed at attracting viewers: big-name artists with new material, unusual collaborations, all-star tributes to deceased luminaries and pairings of emerging artists with veterans.This year is no exception. Justin Timberlake is slated to perform material from his first album in seven years. A tribute to Levon Helm will bring together the Zac Brown Band, Mavis Staples, T-Bone Burnett, Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes and Mumford & Sons. Bruno Mars, Sting and Rihanna will collaborate with Damian Marley on a reggae segment. Elton John will perform a duet with Ed Sheeran, the wunderkind British singer-songwriter.“I love the idea that I can bring young audiences to classic artists and an older audience to young artists, and I don’t know any other show that can do that,” Mr. Ehrlich said.His strategy of stepping up the number of unusual artist pair-ups, or “Grammy moments,” as the Recording Academy president, Neil Portnow, likes to call them, seems to have reversed a decline in interest in the awards. Ratings have climbed steadily since 2008, when only 17 million tuned in. Last year’s show drew nearly 40 million, the most since the mid-1980s, though that number was driven by the death of Whitney Houston the night before and by the return of Adele to the stage after throat surgery.Mr. Ehrlich is a small, stocky, intense man with a short beard who moves around the stage and arena with short, determined steps, talking constantly into a headset to the director, the lighting designer, the graphics wizards and the head stage manager. His colleagues say he has a knack for putting musicians at ease and translating their visions for television. He can be tough, even on divas.“I’ve seen him butt heads with stars to make them look their best,” said David Wild, the head writer for the show. “I’ve seen him tell them, ‘That’s not going to work for us,’ and he usually gets his way.”The show involves about 40 performers, thousands of lighting cues, hundreds of prerecorded audio tracks and scores of video graphics, all of which have to be rehearsed and mixed into a seamless flow. In the video control room alone, a team of eight people, led by Mr. Horvitz, is needed to direct the movements of 18 cameras, catching everything from performances to the looks on the faces of the winners.There are 22 stage managers setting up and striking sets on two stages. They also must move amplifiers, guitars, pianos and drum sets — all on rolling platforms — into position for more than 19 performances. About 40 lighting technicians are needed to handle about 1,400 stage lights.Sometimes things go spectacularly wrong at the last minute.Last year Mr. Ehrlich was forced to change much of the show the night before when Houston was found dead in a bathtub at the Beverly Hilton. Within minutes of hearing the news, colleagues said, he had decided to ask Jennifer Hudson to sing one of Houston’s signature songs, “I Will Always Love You,” as a memorial. And the script was rewritten to include a prayer for her read by the host, L L Cool J.Mr. Ehrlich is a perfectionist about the show’s look. This year he decided to string long loops of simple lights from the ceiling of the arena to evoke the piazzas of Italian towns during festivals.That attention to detail was evident during Rihanna’s rehearsal on Thursday, when he spent nearly 40 minutes working on the lighting of her face as she sang “Stay.” Departing from the dance-heavy numbers she often does, Rihanna performs the song as a tortured duet with Mikky Ekko, who wrote it.She started by singing straight out to the audience, but Mr. Ehrlich was fascinated with the image of her profile when she turned to Mr. Ekko. He marched up to the stage and demonstrated how she should face in Mr. Ekko’s direction through the entire song. Then he experimented with the lighting to cast her face partly in shadow and to end the segment with her silhouette.“This woman has the most exquisite profile,” he said. “That’s special. That just shows here in a whole different way.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/arts/music/paul-tanner-musician-with-good-vibrations-dies-at-95.html,"Paul Tanner, a former trombonist for the Glenn Miller Ochestra who played an unlikely role in the history of rock ’n’ roll when, using a device he helped invent, he performed the famous electronic accompaniment on the Beach Boys’ signature recording “Good Vibrations,” died on Tuesday in Carlsbad, Calif. He was 95.His stepson Douglas Darnall confirmed the death.Mr. Tanner’s path to the Beach Boys was both circuitous and serendipitous. He played and recorded with Glenn Miller from 1938 until 1942; served, like Miller, in the Army Air Forces during World War II; and, afterward, returned to the band when it was led by Tex Beneke. (Miller was killed in 1944 when the transport plane in which he was a passenger disappeared over the English Channel.)In the early 1950s he went to California to play on soundtracks and in live performances for ABC Television. He became something of a musician-of-all-trades, taking up a variety of oddball instruments and performing on them when a quirky score called for it, according to Dan Del Fiorentino, a friend and music industry historian. Thus came about Mr. Tanner’s interest in the theremin, an electronic instrument invented by Leon Theremin, a Russian, around 1920.The device, consisting of two audio oscillators and an amplifier inside a wooden or metal housing, was played by waving one’s hands in proximity to — but not touching — two antennas, one controlling volume and the other controlling pitch.By moving the hands closer to or farther from the antennas, an expert player could make the theremin sound like one orchestral instrument or another. With its otherworldly timbre, the theremin became associated with spookiness and the supernatural. Mr. Tanner knew of it from its use on the soundtracks for “The Day the Earth Stood Still” and Alfred Hitchcock’s “Spellbound.”But while recording a film soundtrack one day and watching a theremin player struggle with the device, his hands unable to locate specific pitches, Mr. Tanner, who had no electronics expertise, had an idea.He contacted an actor friend, Bob Whitsell, who also ran a television repair business, and asked him if he could build an instrument that would replicate the sound of a theremin but with hands-on mechanical controls for volume and pitch rather than antennas. After a false start or two, they produced what became known as the electro-theremin.Mr. Tanner played it for several years for musical recordings, movie soundtracks (including “Strait-Jacket,” a 1964 thriller with Joan Crawford), television shows (including “My Favorite Martian”) and commercials. He never reproduced or tried to market the device.How Mr. Tanner ended up playing with the Beach Boys is uncertain, but one version of the story is that Brian Wilson, the group’s leader and chief songwriter, called ABC looking for a theremin player and was directed to Mr. Tanner. On “Good Vibrations,” the instrument created a delirious, rising-in-pitch backdrop to the song’s chorus. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100.Mr. Tanner also played on two other Beach Boys tracks, “I Just Wasn’t Made for These Times” and “Wild Honey.”“Strange group to work with,” Mr. Tanner said in a 2001 interview. “The only one who seemed to have any idea of music at all was Brian Wilson.”Paul O. W. Tanner was born in Kentucky on Oct. 15, 1917. When he was 6 he moved with his family to Wilmington, Del., where his father was superintendent of a juvenile detention facility. Paul studied piano and took up the trombone at 13.Mr. Tanner’s first marriage, to Alma Smith, ended with her death in 1981. In addition to his stepson Douglas, his survivors include his wife, the former Jeanette Steele, whom he married in 1984; another stepson, Dick Darnall; two brothers; and two stepgranddaughters.Mr. Tanner said he declined an invitation by Mr. Wilson to join the Beach Boys on the road. The inventor Robert Moog then created a different machine for the group that was played in performances by the singer Mike Love. Mr. Tanner said he had recognized that Moog synthesizers were the future, so he donated his instrument to a hospital, which used it to test patients’ hearing.Mr. Tanner was also a composer who wrote several pieces for featured trombone. He wrote numerous books about jazz, including a well-known textbook, “A Study of Jazz.” He graduated from the University of California, Los Angeles, in 1958, and taught there for the next 23 years, often drawing to his classroom visiting musicians like Herbie Hancock and Stan Kenton. He earned his master’s degree and Ph.D. from U.C.L.A. as well.“Nowadays they’re so intelligent and ask so many questions, you’re kept on your mettle,” Mr. Tanner said about his students in a 1976 interview with the jazz writer Leonard Feather. “The question I remember best was asked in class one day. One kid said, ‘Professor Tanner, did they have groupies in the swing era?’ I said, ‘Yes, your mama.’ ”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/arts/music/mets-titles-translate-rigoletto-into-1960-rat-pack-speak.html,"My sights are set on a swingin’ girl,So hop on, baby, let’s take that whirl!— Giuseppe Verdi, 1813-1901Yes, it sounds more like Dean Martin. But that couplet comes from Verdi, at least at the Metropolitan Opera these days. The lines are among the seat-back titles for the Met’s current run of “Rigoletto,” which has its next performance on Friday night.The director, Michael Mayer, has set the production in 1960 Las Vegas, transferring the thuggish morality of the court of 16th-century Mantua to the neon-lighted, satin-jacket world of Dino, Sammy and Frank.Setting operas from past centuries in recent times is a staple of opera direction today, especially in Europe, and it sparks feuds between traditionalists and updaters as regularly as the sun rises. But the Met production has a particularly unusual aspect: titles that go beyond the libretto, written by Francesco Maria Piave, to a degree rarely seen at the house.The liberties push the envelope on how an opera that had its premiere in 1851 Venice can be produced in 2013 New York. An examination of the titles also illuminates the delicate but obscure art of telegraphing an opera’s libretto in brief flashes of two 38-character lines (an early form of tweeting, perhaps) without distracting the viewer from what is on the stage or straying too far from the meaning of the text.Take the quote above about swingin’ girls, in which the Duke discusses his philosophy of seduction in the aria “Questa o quella.” The Italian literally reads, “I would defy even the hundred eyes of Argus if a beautiful woman strikes me.”Hop on, baby!The subtitles also use words and phrases like “yikes,” “get a load of the new dupe,” “jackpot,” “pack of lousy, rotten rats,” “home run” and “dreamboat,” none of which, it is safe to say, would have been uttered by Verdi or Piave. The Count of Monterone, who appears in traditional Arab robes to deliver his curse, is called “Your Sheikness.” “Signor” becomes “big shot,” “bella” becomes “knockout,” “fool” becomes “funnyman” or “jerk.”At the dramatic climax, when Rigoletto thinks he is standing before the Duke’s body (alas, it is that of his daughter, Gilda), he declares in Italian that his nemesis “lies at my feet.” The Met title has Rigoletto say, “And now I’m the headliner!”The orchestra plays the notes as Verdi wrote them, and the singers sing Piave’s original words. But the English-speaking audience member reading the titles gains a very different impression of Piave’s language.The opera’s creative team says the titles are simply an extension of the opera’s updated setting.“In terms of the tone, we wanted to capture some of that ‘bada-bing,’ that sort of swinging, Rat Pack ‘Fly Me to the Moon’ language,” Mr. Mayer said. “Why not make it as fresh and relevant to what’s happening visually as possible? The fewer disconnects the better.”Peter Gelb, the Met’s general manager, pointed out that titles have always been loosely rendered, omitting words or changing elements mentioned in the original libretto.The goal is clarity and coherent storytelling, he said, especially when an opera’s setting has been so drastically changed. “You’re obliged to have the titles go along,” he said. “Otherwise you pull the rug out from under the change of setting.”J. D. McClatchy, a poet, librettist and sometime Met title maker, said that once a director sets the course, there is no choice but to follow. “That’s what makes me very nervous about directors,” he said, speaking in general terms, “that they will change things to suit themselves, rather than the text they’ve been given to interpret.”Paul Cremo, the Met dramaturge and the man who oversees the titles, said that updating 19th-century language was a delicate balancing act. Titles should not wander too far from “what’s actually being said,” he added, yet convey meaning quickly as the opera train rushes on, match the production’s style and present the essential meaning of the text.“It’s an exercise in minimalism,” he said.For “Rigoletto,” Spanish and German versions are also available, as well as a straight Italian condensation reflecting the more archaic original. (Italian is now included for Italian operas, thanks to a request by the Italian consul, Mr. Gelb said.)New York City Opera introduced projected titles to the United States in 1983, showing them above the stage. Twelve years later the Met installed its seat-back system. Now, the vast majority of opera houses in the world have some sort of titling.At the Met, a cue caller watches monitors of the conductor and stage and follows along with an annotated score, signaling the moment for each title. A technician presses a button to activate it.Michael Panayos is the house’s head title man. In the case of “Rigoletto,” which runs through May 1, he and Mr. Cremo took an existing set of “Rigoletto” titles and rejiggered them to match as closely as possible Mr. Mayer’s Rat Pack spirit. “It was like being in the writers’ room of a TV show,” Mr. Cremo said.In “Questa o quella,” the Duke is a Sinatra-like figure delivering the aria as a lounge singer, holding a microphone and surrounded by showgirls. Mr. Cremo said he and Mr. Panayos read through the lyrics of Sinatra songs to find the right spirit.Of the “Hop on, baby” couplet, Mr. Cremo said: “I don’t think it’s that far off. It’s a very hip, finger-snappy, Rat Pack way of saying it.”Mr. Mayer said some tweaks were made after opening night, including cutting “Arab” from references to the curse to avoid distracting audiences from the general nature of the malediction.Mr. McClatchy said he liked the “Rigoletto” titles but could not resist suggesting some tweaking of his own. “I was surprised the titles didn’t go a little further,” he said. “I would have called him Duke, not the Duke.”And he suggested naming the seedy bar run by the assassin Sparafucile and his seductive sister Maddalena the “S&M Club.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/movies/john-kerr-star-of-tea-and-sympathy-dies-at-81.html,"John Kerr, a Tony Award-winning actor who was best known for roles that challenged bigotry in the 1950s in films like “Tea and Sympathy” and “South Pacific,” and who turned down a starring movie role because of ideological differences with its subject, Charles Lindbergh, died on Feb. 2 in Los Angeles. He was 81.The cause was congestive heart failure, said his son, Michael.Mr. Kerr won the Tony in 1954 for his role in the Broadway production of Robert Anderson’s “Tea and Sympathy.” He played a sensitive teenager whose prep school classmates torment him because they assume he is gay. When he starred in the 1956 film version, MGM avoided mention of homosexuality by having his tormentors harass him for being a sissified “sister boy.”The character, who turns out to be neither, falls in love with the schoolmaster’s wife, played by Deborah Kerr (who was no relation) in both versions.In 1957 Mr. Kerr appeared in the film version of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical “South Pacific” playing Lt. Joseph Cable, whose racial prejudice keeps him from marrying the girl he loves.Mr. Kerr had stage, film and television roles throughout the 1950s. He played opposite Leslie Caron in “Gaby” (1956), a movie about a doomed love affair in London during World War II, and appeared on television series like “The Alcoa Hour” and “Playhouse 90.”He was offered the Lindbergh role in 1956 for the Warner Brothers film “The Spirit of St. Louis,” about Lindbergh’s historic trans-Atlantic flight. His decision to turn it down was widely publicized.“I don’t admire the ideals of the hero,” Mr. Kerr told The New York Post, referring to statements Lindbergh had made sympathetic to Nazi Germany before America’s entry in World War II. The part went to James Stewart, despite studio concerns that he was too old for the part. (Mr. Stewart was 23 years older than Mr. Kerr.)“My father was no radical, but Lindbergh was a Nazi sympathizer,” Michael Kerr said.The decision roughly coincided with the zenith of Mr. Kerr’s film stardom, and he was never sure if it had hurt his career. His enthusiasm for the work began to wane around that time, too. “He never loved Hollywood — the waiting around and the boredom,” his son said.Mr. Kerr had roles in other movies, notably in “The Pit and the Pendulum,” Roger Corman’s 1961 adaptation of the Edgar Allan Poe story; it starred Vincent Price. But he worked mainly in television in the ’60s, including a recurring role as a district attorney on “Peyton Place.”John Grinham Kerr was born on Nov. 15, 1931, in Manhattan. His parents, Geoffrey Kerr, a British playwright, and June Walker, an American actress, divorced when he was 8. He graduated from Harvard College in 1952.Besides his son, Mr. Kerr is survived by his wife, Barbara Chu; two stepchildren, Sharon and Chris Chu; two daughters from his first marriage, Rebecca Kerr and Jocelyn Kerr-Thantrakul; and seven grandchildren.In 1966, while continuing to work in television, Mr. Kerr became a full-time law student at the University of California, Los Angeles.. He graduated in 1969 and was admitted to the California bar in 1970. He maintained a successful private practice in Los Angeles until his retirement in 2000, specializing in personal injury and medical malpractice cases.“My dad originally intended to become a novelist,” Michael Kerr said. “He saw acting as a way to support himself in the meantime. Then he won the Tony. Then he went to Hollywood.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/opinion/sunday/catching-up-with-benh-zeitlin.html,"Benh Zeitlin is the writer, director and soundtrack composer of the fantasy drama “Beasts of the Southern Wild,” which has been nominated for four Oscars. It was made for a fraction of the cost of other Oscar-nominated films, with scenes shot primarily in Louisiana swampland and with leading roles played by amateur actors.READING I’ve been reading a lot of Yoruba mythology actually. It’s an African literature tradition. Right now I’m into “The Forest of a Thousand Daemons” by D. O. Fagunwa. It’s the most disturbing and thrilling kind of mythological imagery that I’ve ever read. It definitely gets your mind cooking. Particularly with writing, you always want things that are cutting up the way you think and challenging your brain to wrap itself around some pretty gigantic concepts.LISTENING I’ve been traveling around the world all year and when I get interviewed by entertainment journalists from places I’ve never been, I like to ask them what they’re listening to. My favorite thing now is this composer from India named Ismail Darbar, whose soundtrack to the Bollywood film “Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam” is amazing; really cool orchestration.I’m also a big Stooges Brass Band fan. They are my staple Thursday night rampage in New Orleans. It’s one of the younger, more hip-hop-influenced brass bands. Their shows are wild and have great dancers. They never disappoint.WATCHING I just got back from the Kustendorf Film Festival in the mountains of Serbia and I saw my favorite movie of the year, called “Reality,” by Matteo Garrone. It’s about this guy who runs a fish market whose life starts to collapse when he gets the whir of the idea that he might be able to get on a reality television show. It’s a film with faces and actors that you’ve never seen before. It’s got this wild energy that reminds me of an early Milos Forman film.FOLLOWING The NOLA Defender. It’s my hometown paper and has my all-time favorite slogan: “Blood, Alcohol, Content.” It’s a daily update and I’m so homesick on the road that I’m literally looking at who’s playing where each night and imaging myself at the concert. I’m checking out Mardi Gras parades, and they always have great stories about bumbling criminals in New Orleans, like anytime someone robs a bar with a fire extinguisher.MEDICATING I was in Italy recently and I got some honeybee propolis extract from the people I was staying with. It’s this crazy paste stuff that bees use when like a rat invades a bee colony and they kill it. So it won’t rot, they basically embalm and mummify the rat with this propolis substance. I love the image of that, like there’s this dead rat in the middle of your living room forever. I was given a vial of propolis because I was sick and was told to squirt it in my mouth every day and it would cure me of my ills — and it works. They did peel the rat out of it before they gave me the stuff."
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/fashion/timothy-white-the-photographer-have-banter-will-travel.html,"In 2005, after meeting on the set of “Mr. and Mrs. Smith,” Timothy White and Brad Pitt went on a five-day motorcycle ride in the Mojave Desert. The adventure was partly for fun (both love bikes) and partly for work (Mr. White took along a stylist, racks of clothes and two assistants, who followed in a Winnebago for a photo shoot).But on the first evening, things went awry. “We had another 80 miles to go and it’s pitch black,” Mr. White recalled the other day at his Midtown studio. “All I’m seeing is headlights and then I’m seeing the front end of his bike wobble. He wiped out. I pulled over and I was freaking out.“Like, I just killed Brad Pitt.”Of course, that didn’t happen. Mr. Pitt went on to become Mr. Angelina Jolie and make perfume commercials. And after the actor checked out of a Las Vegas hospital with minor scrapes, the motorcycle trip resumed and netted several memorable images: Mr. Pitt channeling James Dean at a dusty gas station; Mr. Pitt hanging at the Chicken Ranch, a legal brothel in Nevada; Mr. Pitt in bed, looking vulnerable yet coy at a roadside motel.It would not be the first, nor last time, that Mr. White palled his way to snapping A-list celebrities of the sort Ryan Seacrest might chase down a red carpet. In a career that spans three decades, Mr. White has photographed Harrison Ford, Sophia Loren, Audrey Hepburn, Paul McCartney, Axl Rose, Whitney Houston, Nicolas Cage, Whoopi Goldberg, Yoko Ono, Elizabeth Taylor and oodles more for Rolling Stone, Vanity Fair and other magazines.“The lifestyle, it’s all kind of rock ’n’ roll,” said Mr. White, 57, as he reclined on a dark leather sofa in his immaculate five-story carriage house on West 54th Street, where he lives and works. His jet-set work schedule (flights to Australia and Russia on a client’s whim, he said) has made him particularly chummy with the grizzled rocker-cum-biker set.Yet, despite dizzying success, Mr. White seems restless. He partnered with the Morisson Hotel Gallery, a fine arts photography gallery, to open a new outpost at the Sunset Marquis in Los Angeles, just in time for this weekend’s Grammys. He’s also pitching a reality show on car restoration.Not that he’s given up his bread and butter. On the second floor, two assistants were touching up his photographs of Kim and Kourtney Kardashian for an E! network promo. On the ground floor, a custom chopper built by Indian Larry stands by the door, near a silver Aston Martin.Dressed in a black long-sleeve crew neck, jeans and beat-up boots, Mr. White was as slim and poised as any of his famous subjects (he runs and practices Iyengar yoga with a private instructor). He speaks in constant but smooth streams of sentences, and likes to direct the conversation, a manner likely honed from keeping actors and rock stars focused on long photo shoots.He called his job a psychological one of sorts, but when pressed, he added: “It’s more really a manipulator. I mean it’s not exploitative, but it’s definitely manipulative.” To get the photo, he tries to “lead them and mold them,” but without “prying too much.”“That’s all anybody does to them,” he said of his celebrity subjects. “So I talk about things to disarm them, because no matter what, their guard is up. That’s the nature of a photo shoot. I can talk motorcycles. I can talk a little bit of ballet. I talk about me.”He might, for example, joke about the suburbs. Mr. White grew up in Fort Lee, N.J., the youngest of three in a middle-class family. His father was a financial controller for the Coast Guard, stationed on Governors Island, and his mother was a housewife. His two older sisters were big Beatles fans, and once took him to a concert when he was 9.As a “young delinquent,” he said jokingly, he made New York his teenage playground. After high school, he enrolled at the University of Arizona to study landscape architecture, but didn’t take to the party atmosphere. He transferred to the Rhode Island School of Design, where he studied photography.In 1979, upon graduating, he moved back to New York, renting a ramshackle Chelsea loft with two friends, and hustled for jobs. To pay rent, he photographed aspiring models for various modeling agencies and schools, often as many as 50 to 75 young women a day — an intense pace that he said taught him to maintain a steady banter “to keep people working, distracted, engaged.”He attributes his rise to pluck and people skills. An early gig in 1988 involved shooting Harrison Ford in Jackson Hole, Wyo. “He’s a real grump,” Mr. White said, chuckling. But after their first day on the shoot, they bonded by taking a walk through the woods, while smoking a joint together, Mr. White said.They hit it off, and over the years, they’ve been up to other boyish shenanigans, like zigzagging the country in Mr. Ford’s biplane and helicopter, and riding along Route 66 on their motorcycles. “Harrison’s become a true friend,” Mr. White said, before adding, “Truthfully, he’s helped my career.”By the late ’80s, the photographer had worked his way to more magazine assignments, and particularly, a plum cover contract with Rolling Stone, for which he once shot Bon Jovi dressed all in black with a white horse rearing up as backdrop.“It was a major thing at the time: it was a real horse in the studio in London,” he said. “Nowadays, it doesn’t mean anything. You could just do a photo composite.”Another bold shoot he recalled involved setting Eddie Van Halen’s hand on fire. That wouldn’t happen now, he said, because young stars, whether they be Robert Pattinson or Jennifer Hudson, won’t go to the same lengths for a photo.“We’re inundated with images,” he added. “We just look at it and delete it. I know I sound old, but we really studied imagery.”Age is catching up with him in other ways. His mother and father are both 93 and he recently separated from his wife. He finds himself reflecting on his career more often.“It’s lucrative and all of that, but it’s hard to share with people,” he said. “Like there’s the extravagance of it all. Lunch alone on a shoot could cost $25,000 because somebody wanted sushi flown in. Unless you’re in the business or have a sense of the business, no one really gets what I do.”So in addition to his decadent celebrity shoots and more movie posters (his next projects include “Paranoia” and “Ender’s Game,” both starring Mr. Ford), he is embarking on something personal: a photo book about his parents, documenting history, aging and inevitable loss.“They’re the subjects: the security and support that I’ve had my whole life,” he said. “But I’m looking through them to see myself.”"

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/arts/television/continuum-on-syfy-is-latest-canadian-tv-import.html,"SQUAMISH, British Columbia — The people behind “Continuum,” a slick Canadian science-fiction drama recently imported to the United States by Syfy, are very conscious that their growing international audience is a demanding, detail-oriented bunch. But the other day during the filming here of a Season 2 scene that had actors in a drainage tunnel with a roaring helicopter at one end, one detail was beyond anyone’s control.“Hair continuity is a real problem with the wind tunnel,” Rachel Nichols, the show’s star, said after sprinting from the tunnel for yet another take, her long hair hopelessly askew.Ms. Nichols plays a police officer from the future on the series, which became a hit for the Showcase cable network in Canada during its first season last year and began showing on Syfy last month. American viewers have long been accustomed to British imports — “Downton Abbey,” all those interchangeable detective shows — but “Continuum” is a reminder that Canadian series can also be competitive in the international marketplace.“The show has now sold to 50 countries, and I think one of the reasons it has is because it looks like a quote-unquote American show,” Simon Barry, its creator, said over lunch in Vancouver the day before the Squamish shoot. “Everybody in this town knows how to make those, because a lot of them are made here. But traditionally Canadian shows haven’t really leveraged that aspect of the filmmaking process.”It helped too that Mr. Barry’s premise for the series has sociopolitical resonance in almost any country. Ms. Nichols’s character, Kiera, is a police officer (or “protector,” as they’re called in the future) in Vancouver in 2077 who, as the show opens, is on hand for the execution of the members of Liber8, a terrorist group responsible for a devastating bomb attack on the corporations that rule the late-21st-century world. Just before the sentence is carried out the eight convicts transport themselves back in time, accidentally bringing Kiera along.They wind up in the Vancouver of 2012, the Liber8 members trying to stop the coming of a world in which civil government has been supplanted and Kiera — still loyal to the corporate government of 2077 — doing her best to thwart them. The show’s deliberate ambiguity has fans debating on chat boards whether “Continuum” is a pro-business, right-wing series or the opposite. And Kiera, as Season 1 progresses, gradually confronts the possibility that she is fighting for the wrong side.“We’re trying to keep the gray area gray,” Mr. Barry said. “We all know the old saying of one man’s terrorist is another man’s freedom fighter. Conceptually we can mine that for drama.”He added, “Time travel and displacement of time allow for displacement of perception and perspective.”Contributing to Kiera’s angst is concern about the husband and son she left behind in 2077, giving a personal dimension to the classic time traveler’s worry about whether intervening in the past will alter the future.For Ms. Nichols, whose previous work includes the CBS drama “Criminal Minds,” the role is a mental as well as a physical workout, since each episode spends time in both 2077 and our present.“It’s studying up two different characters, one from a time that I know that my character doesn’t know, and one from a time that I don’t know that my character does know,” she said. “It’s a little complex.”The show came about almost by accident. Mr. Barry, who got his start in the business as a cameraman, spent years writing for various pilots in the American market but had never had a series make it to air. He was developing “Continuum” in hopes of pitching it to an American cable network, but he put it on the shelf when he was hired to work on still another pilot.There it sat until October 2010, when Pat Williams, a veteran director with whom Mr. Barry had worked, was scheduled for a routine meeting with Shaw Media, a Toronto company whose properties include the Showcase channel. Mr. Williams, looking for a project to pitch at that session, asked Mr. Barry if he had anything in the works, and “Continuum” came up.Shaw liked what it heard. Tom Rowe of Reunion Pictures became an executive producer along with Mr. Barry and Mr. Williams, adding a layer of production and financing expertise, and Jeff King, a producer on series like “White Collar,” helped Mr. Barry get up to speed on how to be a show runner. The premiere of “Continuum” last May drew 1.7 million viewers, a significant number in Canada, where the population is 35 million.Thomas P. Vitale, Syfy’s executive vice president for programming and original movies, said he knew “Continuum” was a good fit for his network a few minutes into the first episode.“As the world gets smaller and smaller, these international shows are more appealing, and we’ll be buying more of them,” Mr. Vitale said. “Good entertainment cuts across national lines.”Countless American series have been shot in Canada over the years, of course, but recently shows initially made for the Canadian market, like “Flashpoint,” have been successful abroad. “Continuum” joined another Canadian show, “Lost Girl,” on Syfy’s Monday night lineup.“These aren’t just schedule fillers,” Mr. Vitale said. “These are high-profile shows.”And the actors can feel that they’re in a different league.“Five years or 10 years ago a Canadian show would only be a Canadian show, ” Victor Webster, who plays Kiera’s 2012 police partner, said as he waited for the next blast of helicopter hurricane. “But the shows that are coming out of Canada now are so good.”The scene being shot here was fairly elaborate for the series, so much so that cast members were taking cellphone pictures as if they’d never seen a helicopter before. Other high-impact visuals come courtesy of Artifex Studios, a special-effects outfit in Vancouver where the owner, Adam Stern, and his staff brought the Vancouver of 2077 to life.Anyone who knows present-day Vancouver was given a lot to think about the first time 2077 Vancouver was unveiled. Stanley Park, the city’s equivalent of Central Park, had sprouted skyscrapers, and discerning viewers noted a dam in the background in English Bay, presumably holding back the higher water levels produced by global warming.Not that Mr. Barry would make any of that explicit in the scripts. “Continuum” fans don’t need to be told what to draw from a given scene; they’re scrutinizing everything pretty carefully. Kiera, for instance, has digitally enhanced vision, and shots from her point of view have graphic displays imposed on them. It quickly became apparent from fan feedback that certain obsessive viewers were freeze-framing those shots and studying the graphics for information.“I go to my guys and say, ‘That can’t be gibberish,’ ” Mr. Barry recalled. So the digital displays contain nuggets for the freeze-framers.And there’s the matter of the horse that 2012 Kiera encounters in a Season 1 episode coming up this month for Syfy viewers. The decision was to have Ms. Nichols play the moment as if she had never seen a horse before.“The Internet lit up, because we never actually said why she reacted,” Mr. Barry said. “And a huge conversation was triggered about whether there were animals in 65 years, whether global climate change affected the ecosystem — all these variations of things that, by the way, we would never have thought up in the room when we were writing. The lesson there is: You don’t have to spell it out.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/movies/oscar-nominated-no-stirring-debate-in-chile.html,"The blunt title of “No,” directed by Pablo Larraín and one of the five nominees for best foreign-language film in this year’s Academy Awards, refers to an inspiring moment in the history of Chile, his native land. In a straight up-or-down, yes-or-no plebiscite there in 1988, the citizenry ended the dictatorship of Gen. Augusto Pinochet by voting him out of power, 15 years after he had seized control in a bloody American-backed coup.Mr. Larraín’s attention to historical detail — the kind of sweaters worn by people on the left, the slang, the fearful atmosphere, his innovative use of archival footage — is a reason he won the top prize at the Directors’ Fortnight at the Cannes Film Festival in May. But at home the film’s reception has been more mixed, with leaders of the real-life No campaign protesting that the film gets several big facts wrong and fundamentally distorts others.The central character and hero of “No,” which opens in limited release on Friday, is the fictional René Saavedra, a hip young advertising executive recently returned from exile in Mexico, played by Gael García Bernal. Hired to produce the ad campaign for the underdog No side, Saavedra faces resistance from stodgily doctrinaire politicians on the left, but he creates a hopeful rainbow logo and a slogan, “Chile, happiness is on its way,” that turn the tide.But no sooner had “No” opened in Chilean cinemas last year than Mr. Larraín found himself under fire on Twitter. “To believe that Pinochet lost the plebiscite because of a TV logo and jingle is not to grasp anything of what occurred,” wrote Francisco Vidal, a cabinet minister in two recent Socialist governments. Mr. Larraín responded that “the movie is just a fragment” that never aimed to “simplify the whole No process to a logo,” but organizers of the No effort have found that explanation unconvincing.“The film is a gross oversimplification that has nothing to do with reality,” Genaro Arriagada, director of the No campaign, said in a telephone interview from Chile. “The idea that, after 15 years of dictatorship in a politically sophisticated country with strong union and student movements, solid political parties and an active human rights movement, all of a sudden this Mexican advertising guy arrives on his skateboard and says, ‘Gentlemen, this is what you have to do,’ that is a caricature.”The Chilean debate over “No” echoes some of the issues that have surfaced this Oscar season in the controversy over Steven Spielberg’s “Lincoln""and especially “Zero Dark Thirty.” To what extent can a filmmaker selectively condense and simplify complicated true events and still claim to have made a work faithful to what really happened?“I just make movies,” Mr. Larraín said, adding: “I’m not the official version of anything. I’m just an artist who does what he wants, what feels best. And if people think that Lincoln is Daniel Day-Lewis, it’s not going to be my problem or Steven Spielberg’s problem.”In the case of “No” the issue is further blurred by Mr. Larraín’s use of documentary footage, shot in 1988, which he estimated amounts to about 30 percent of the film. The rest of “No,” the fictional component, was shot in the same style to give the film a uniform, coherent look, thus merging reality and fiction.“I still get a lot of comments from people who, after watching the movie, they say: ‘Oh you did a great job with Pinochet. That actor really looks like him,' ” Mr. Larraín said in an interview in New York last fall. “And I’m like, ‘No, no, no, wait.’ ”In the interview Mr. Larraín described “No” as a pastiche with “a strange balance between documentary and fiction,” adding that “the way things happen in the movie is not exactly the way they were, but the facts are the same.”Asked last month for his formulation Mr. García Bernal used somewhat different language. “The film is definitely faithful to the nature of the true events, true to their sentiment,” he said. “I think that’s what you can say. Of course there are also many more details that you can’t be sure about.”Describing the film as a fable, he added that “it manages to grab hold of two or three elements that show the nature of what was at stake at that time.”“No” is loosely based on “The Plebiscite,” a play written by Antonio Skármeta, a Chilean who is also the author of the novel that was made into the Oscar-winning film “Il Postino.” He invented the René Saavedra character, but his Saavedra is very different from Mr. Larrain’s: 50ish, politically engaged, idealistic and happily married rather than 30ish, indifferent to politics, careerist and separated.That said, Mr. Skármeta, who has followed the controversy in Chile, emphasized that he likes “No,” praising it for its “fascinating perspective” and the performances. But even if he didn’t, he said, he would defend Mr. Larraín’s right to make the movie as he saw fit.“A work of art does not have to be reduced to history or represent history,” he said. “The movie does truly lack what took place under the iceberg, which did appear in my play and novel. So the criticisms of the political leadership are correct in that sense. But this is a work of art that uses reality to do something else that is provocative and interesting, that reflects the views of a different, younger generation.”“No” has also been criticized for what it leaves out. The numerous books and academic theses that have been written on the plebiscite over the last quarter-century uniformly credit the anti-Pinochet forces’ grass-roots effort to register 7.5 million Chileans as pivotal to their success at the polls, but that is a subject that Mr. Larraín does not address.José Miguel Vivanco, the director of Human Rights Watch Americas, is a Chilean who in 1988 served as a poll watcher on voting day. Though he said he likes “No,” which he described as “a good effort to show a pretty accurate picture of Chile in the ‘80s,” he also stressed the importance of the opposition’s long-term ground game.“The  campaign for the No contained a huge component that was the electoral registry,” Mr. Vivanco said in a telephone interview from Washington. Voters “had to be educated about participating in a process that was perceived by many as not legitimate. How do you persuade people to take this seriously” when many were convinced that the Pinochet side “will engage in fraud, will use me, will never allow themselves to lose?”“All of that was obviously a big component, and it’s true it is not part of the film at all,” Mr. Vivanco added. “But I went to see a movie, not a PBS piece.”Mr. Larraín acknowledged the importance of the registration effort, calling it amazing. But he also argued that when confronted with the limits of cinema, he trusted his own instincts and interests.“I had a four-and-a-half-hour first cut, with pretty much everything in it,” he said. “But a movie is not a testament. It’s just the way we looked at it. I thought I wanted to stay on the marketing side because it means more for me.”In Chile the debate about “No” has also been complicated by noncinematic issues, including Mr. Larraín’s descent from two prominent right-wing families that supported Pinochet. His father, Hernán, is a senator who was also president of the main pro-Pinochet party, and his mother, Magdalena Matte, who served as a cabinet minister in Chile’s current conservative government, belongs to a branch of perhaps the richest family in the country.There is no exact American parallel, but it is almost as if a director whose father is a Tea Party leader and whose mother comes from the Koch family were to make a movie aboutbBarack Obama. In some quarters of both the political and the artistic worlds, Mr. Larraín, 36, is suspected of disguising himself as an admirer of the No campaign to advance a right-wing agenda that focuses on a heroic outsider instead of collective action by the center and left.“Here Larraín shows his more conservative profile,” Matías Sánchez wrote in the magazine El Ciudadano. The film, he added, reflects “the crisis of identity of Pablo Larraín himself, who debates between advertising and film, between right and left, between being an aristocrat in Chile and a political filmmaker abroad.”Mr. Larraín acknowledged that his background is in some respects a liability, noting that “with my two last names there are people who write Pablo Larraín Matte six times in the review, with capital letters,” to call attention to his family’s links to the right wing. But he bristled at the notion that his parentage should disqualify him from addressing the plebiscite.Perhaps some people are upset “because this movie is going to spread all over the world and is something that will be seen in politics classes,” he said. “Maybe they don’t want the story told that way. But what I think they really don’t like is that it’s me who is telling this story, because of my biography, my last names, the people who surround me, my parents, whatever.”Mr. Arriagada’s concerns are different. Because the No campaign triumphed, he has been in demand ever since as an adviser to societies trying to effect a peaceful transition to democracy from dictatorship, first in Latin America and then in Arab countries. He worries that because “No” is being released around the world, its simplified message will be taken as real.Signs suggest that is starting to happen, just as the generation of Mr. Arriagada, who just turned 70, once looked to Gillo Pontecorvo’s “Battle of Algiers” as a how-to manual to conduct urban guerrilla warfare. Mr. García Bernal, for example, told of how, when “No” was shown at the Abu Dhabi Film Festival — where he won an award for best actor — locals were eager to learn more about Chile’s experience.“That’s not the way that it happens,” Mr. Arriagada said of the process depicted in the film. “If it were, it would be great, and we would open offices in Washington or New York and overthrow dictators everywhere. This is too good to be true.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/arts/feb-10-16.html,"Exploding Words, Exploding TimeVelcro, dear theatergoers, to the word-fracturing, time-splintering world of David Ives. And Harvard U? Oh, you don’t speak Unamunda? All right then: “Velcro” means “Welcome” and “Harvard U,” how are you of course. Unamunda, which is practiced in one of the short plays that make up Mr. Ives’s “All in the Timing” is the creation of a two-bit huckster, but that doesn’t mean it’s that different from any other language.One of the points of this anthology of comic sketches from the early 1990s, which opens on Tuesday in a Primary Stages production at 59E59 Theaters, is that language, like time and space, is utterly, confoundingly relative. That means that communication is a desperate, random and — as Mr. Ives presents it — exceedingly funny proposition. This 20th-anniversary revival, directed by John Rando, reintroduces New Yorkers to Mr. Ives’s mind-bending riffs on cultural and intellectual touchstones like Einstein, Trotsky, Philip Glass and those immortal monkeys with typewriters. (Opens Tuesday, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, 212-279-4200, primarystages.org, $70.) BEN  BRANTLEYA Jazz Queen, Joined by FriendsAny number of jazz singers today can transfix a small room; an elite few can effortlessly conquer a concert stage. Dianne Reeves is the rare exception who seems to accomplish both feats at once, powering through whatever song is at hand with a bearing both relatable and regal. She’s an heir to Sarah Vaughan, but not an imitator, and she makes a virtue of her open-mindedness, mingling songbook standards with bossa nova staples and original pop-gospel exhortations.For her concert at Carnegie Hall on Saturday, billed as “Dianne Reeves and Friends,” she’ll be joined by her cousin and longtime producer, the pianist George Duke; several guest vocalists, notably Lalah Hathaway and Esperanza Spalding; and the drummer Terri Lyne Carrington, who featured Ms. Reeves and Ms. Spalding on “The Mosaic Project,” which won a 2012 Grammy for best jazz vocal album.

Such questions are as reckless as they are unanswerable. Still, they arise any time you think about the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra, the noble Dutch institution deemed the world’s best orchestra by a panel of critics assembled by Gramophone magazine in 2008. As demonstrated by “Anthology of the Royal Concertgebouw Orchestra,” a newly completed series of seven 14-CD boxed sets, featuring recordings made from 1935 to 2010, this ensemble has long been among the world’s elite ensembles.Those boxed sets are crammed with intriguing rarities and modern works, assets generally absent from the orchestra’s touring programs. Still, with the prospect of hearing Mariss Jansons conduct Mahler’s Symphony No. 1 on Wednesday and Bruckner’s Seventh Symphony on Thursday, no one is likely to complain. (8 p.m., Carnegie Hall, 212-247-7800, carnegiehall.org; $22.50 to $140.) STEVE SMITHFresh Off the Boat From AmericaOn the economic front relations between the United States and China are strained, but “Shanghai Calling” takes a stab at finding humor there with a cross-cultural tale involving an American lawyer and his efforts to adjust to the city of the title. Daniel Henney stars as the lawyer, Sam, who is less than pleased when he is sent to Shanghai by his New York firm to handle clients there.“Ever been to China before?” a character played by Bill Paxton asks.“I’ve never been above 79th Street before,” Sam answers.The film, which opens on Friday at the Quad Cinema, traffics in incongruity. Americans, so often paranoid about immigration, are the immigrants this time, and the Asian-American Sam is often mistaken for a local. Geng Le is a problem-solving reporter with the unlikely name of Awesome. “In my defense,” he explains to Sam, “I chose this nickname long before advertisers started overusing it to sell lame products to young people.” (34 West 13th Street, Greenwich Village; 212-255-2243, quadcinema.com.) NEIL GENZLINGERHer Life Revealed on Her Own TermsThere’s enough high-voltage performance footage to rival her Super Bowl halftime spectacular. But peel back the spangles and special effects, and the Beyoncé Knowles on display in “Life Is But a Dream,” to have its premiere Saturday at 9 p.m. on HBO, is subdued, barefaced and emotionally raw. Directing the documentary with Ed Burke, Ms. Knowles, a 16-time Grammy Award winner, uses home movies from her Houston childhood and turns her laptop on herself to show a woman trying to have it all: a loving home life with her husband, the rapper Jay-Z; a successful career; and the freedom to simply be.“I’m still trying to learn that I don’t have to kill myself and be so hard on myself and be so critical, and I can smell the roses,” she says before discussing the need for independence that drove her to dismiss her father, Mathew Knowles, as her manager in March 2011. “I don’t want to never be satisfied. I don’t think that’s a healthy way to live.”She also addresses conspiracy theorists who maintain that the couple hired a surrogate to carry their daughter, Blue Ivy, born in January 2012. The proof: Beyoncé artfully exposes her naked silhouette to the camera three weeks before giving birth.KATHRYN SHATTUCKA Triple Bill of BalanchinePacific Northwest Ballet, a Seattle company directed by Peter Boal that is justifiably proud of its diverse repertory, is offering a glimpse of its eclectic programming. A triple bill of masterpieces by George Balanchine from three periods of his career — “Apollo” (1928), “Concerto Barocco” (1941) and “Agon” (1957) — forms an exciting trio, but New Yorkers can see it only on Wednesday. All the company’s other performances are devoted to “Roméo et Juliette,” Jean-Christophe Maillot’s version of Shakespeare’s tale of star-crossed lovers, set to music by Prokofiev.Mr. Maillot, who directs Les Ballets de Monte Carlo, emphasizes emotional turbulence; hands appear to swim through the air, arms fly as if out of control and there are many off-kilter balances. All of this suggests youthful impulsiveness, and the production speeds ahead with an almost cinematic sweep. (7:30 p.m. Wednesday, 8 p.m. Friday; 2 and 8 p.m. Saturday, City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan; 212-581-1212, nycitycenter.org; $35 to $120.)  JACK ANDERSONRenaissance Star Within ReachPiero della Francesca, a pillar of the Italian Renaissance, is arguably the 15th-century painter most revered by modern artists. His mastery of light and space, his majestic figures and singing, subtle colors coalesced into some of the most spellbindingly still yet psychically charged images of his, or any, time. In the measured silence of Piero’s pictures we can almost hear his people think.More than five centuries after his death in 1492 Piero is finally having his first solo show on this continent. “Piero della Francesca in America,” opening Tuesday at the Frick Collection, will present all but one of the seven paintings in public collections in this country, and one loan from abroad.The highlight will probably be “Madonna and Child Enthroned With Four Angels” from the Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute in Williamstown, Mass., but don’t miss his “Saint Anthony,” with his furrowed brow and his cape emblazoned with scenes from Jesus’ life, all the way from Lisbon. (1 East 70th Street, Manhattan; 212-288-0700, frick.org) ROBERTA SMITH"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/arts/music/albums-from-parquet-courts-zeds-dead-ng2-master-p.html,"Parquet CourtsDroll Brooklyn Post-Punk“Light Up Gold” (What’s Your Rupture?), the debut album by Parquet Courts, starts out jittery and never settles down. “I was walking through Ridgewood, Queens/I was flipping through magazines/I was so stoned and starving,” Andrew Savage rambles on “Stoned and Starving,” a dry-wit post-punk number that could almost pass for a novelty song. That careful balance is on display throughout this album, heavy with bubbling, bulbous guitars by way of Wire, the singing and songwriting mostly split between Austin Brown and Mr. Savage, who are astute enough to write taut, smart lyrics, and self-aware enough to arch an eyebrow while maintaining the pose. Sometimes Mr. Savage favors the declamatory style favored by James Murphy of LCD Soundsystem, too cool for melody. That pops up on “Borrowed Time” and “Careers in Combat,” a laundry list of all the American dreams and life choices no longer available to an enterprising young person. All that’s left is to rock.Zeds DeadDiverse Dance MusicIn dance music, scene was once the most important thing; be it the club, the city or the genre, fealty mattered. The Internet, of course, has upended all that, leading young producers to wonder why they should make one type of dance music when they can just as easily make all its types. From Toronto, Zeds Dead is the partnership of the producers DC and Hooks, who have been working together for nearly a decade, and have ingested influences widely: drum ’n’ bass, grime, dubstep, hip-hop and more. They’ve released singles and EPs and albums that have become increasingly eclectic, and the duo’s most recent EP, “Hot Sauce” (Mad Decent), is among its most accomplished. Each track is a different color, as if you had a channel changer in hand — the slinky vintage Chicago house on “Mr. Sub,” the mild soca undertones of “Playa,” the unabated glimmering synths of “Rave.”NG2Puerto Rican Salsa“Al Borde de la Locura” (New Born) is the refreshing new album from NG2, the salsa duo from Puerto Rico made up of Norberto Vélez and Gerardo Rivas (whose father is Jerry Rivas, of the long-running salsa outfit El Gran Combo). The duo, which has been recording for about a decade, has an easy rapport on these songs, which are mainly written by Mr. Vélez, the highlights of which include the booming “Y Ahora Me Voy” and the confidently temperate “Siempre Has Sido Tu.” On their own, the two are direct, smooth singers, and sometimes a little whimsical. But on a few songs here, they beef up their sound by inviting guests with bigger voices — Elvis Crespo on “Tenia Que Acabar,” Rubby Perez on “Yo Se Que Es Mentira” and, very memorably, a swelteringly intense Luisito Carrion on “No Llorare.”Ancient VVisdomTexas Bulldozer Post-MetalFour decades ago, blues-rock was one of the important building blocks for early incarnations of heavy metal. The Austin, Tex., band Ancient VVisdom is now getting down to business with the reverse engineering. “Deathlike” (Prosthetic) is the group’s second album — following the striking “A Godlike Inferno” — and it’s entrancingly powerful with a homemade air, full of churning, dark skeletal songs that move with the grace of an expertly driven bulldozer. There are nods to Metallica’s late-career balladry, the folky grunge of Alice in Chains, Will Oldham on steroids and syrup, and, in terms of strategy, the DIY one-man black metal outfits of a few years past. The frontman, Nathan Opposition, sounds slightly unsteady singing his lyrics with Satanist overtones, but the songs manage a density that sustains him.Master PReturn of the No Limit RapperHere are some things Master P has been up to since he was last in the music spotlight: trying his hand at an inspirational reality-TV show, receiving the key to the city of Memphis, posing for at least one photograph alongside the Obamas and Oprah Winfrey at a fund-raiser in 2007, starting a label for profanity-free hip-hop. Master P, founder of the influential gangster rap label No Limit, was shoring up his good-neighbor bona fides. So much for all that, though. His new mixtape, “Al Capone,” is surprisingly great, and unapologetically rough, in true No Limit fashion. Master P was never a technician, but he was emphatic, and he sounds just as raucous as in his prime, helped out by the coolly menacing Alley Boy, who appears on most of the songs here; Chief Keef; Fat Trel; and other guests happy to have a role model to get rowdy with."

https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/arts/music/donald-byrd-renegade-jazz-trumpeter-dies-at-80.html,"Donald Byrd, one of the leading jazz trumpeters of the 1950s and early 1960s, who became both successful and controversial in the 1970s by blending jazz, funk and rhythm and blues into a pop hybrid that defied categorization, died on Feb. 4 in Dover, Del. He was 80.His death was confirmed by Haley Funeral Directors of Southfield, Mich. Word of Mr. Byrd’s death had circulated online for several days, but was not announced by his family.Almost from the day he arrived in New York City in 1955 from his native Detroit, Mr. Byrd was at the center of the movement known as hard bop, a variation on bebop that put greater emphasis on jazz’s blues and gospel roots. Known for his pure tone and impeccable technique, he performed or recorded with some of the most prominent jazz musicians of that era, including John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk, Sonny Rollins and the drummer Art Blakey, considered one of jazz’s great talent scouts. As a bandleader, Mr. Byrd was sometimes a talent scout too — one of the first to hire a promising young pianist named Herbie Hancock, who, like Mr. Byrd, would later be called a renegade for an approach that won a wide audience but displeased many critics.Mr. Byrd, a strong advocate of music education, spent much of the 1960s teaching. Then, in 1973, he made a surprising transition to pop stardom with the album “Black Byrd,” produced by the brothers Larry and Fonce Mizell, who had been his students at Howard University in Washington. With Mr. Byrd’s restrained licks (he played both trumpet and fluegelhorn) layered over an irresistible funk groove seasoned with wah-wah guitar and simple, repeated lyrics (“Get in the groove, just can’t lose”), “Black Byrd” reached the Billboard Top 100, where it peaked at No. 88.Mr. Byrd was hardly the first jazz musician to try such a crossover: Miles Davis had achieved a similar musical synthesis with “Bitches Brew” three years earlier. But “Black Byrd,” unlike “Bitches Brew,” was overtly pop-oriented, and its success was extremely rare for a jazz musician. It became, and for a long time remained, the best-selling album in the history of Blue Note Records, the venerable jazz label for which Mr. Byrd had been recording since the 1950s.“Then the jazz people starting eating on me,” Mr. Byrd recalled in a 1982 radio interview. “They had a feast on me for 10 years: ‘He’s sold out.’ Everything that’s bad was attributed to Donald Byrd. I weathered it, and then it became commonplace. Then they found a name for it. They started calling it ‘jazz fusion,’ ‘jazz rock.’ ”The criticism did not stop him from making more pop records. In addition to recording as a leader, he organized some of his Howard students into a group called the Blackbyrds and produced their records. The band had a string of hit singles in the 1970s, including “Walking in Rhythm,” which reached the Top 10 on the pop charts, and “Rock Creek Park,” which evoked late-night romance in a wooded park in Washington, D.C.“Rock Creek Park” became something of a local anthem and one of many recordings by Mr. Byrd to be sampled by rap and hip-hop artists, including Public Enemy, Nas and Ludacris. His music and the Blackbyrds’ has been sampled more than 200 times, with the 1975 album “Places and Spaces” among his most frequently repurposed recordings, according to the Web site whosampled.com.“They use all of the music that I did in the ’50s, ’60s and the ’70s behind people like Tupac and LL Cool J,” Mr. Byrd told students in a lecture at Cornell in 1998. “I’m into all that stuff.”Donaldson Toussaint L’Ouverture Byrd II was born in Detroit on Dec. 9, 1932. His father, E. T. Byrd, was a Methodist minister. His music studies there at Wayne State University were interrupted by two years in the Air Force. After receiving a bachelor’s degree from Wayne State, Mr. Byrd moved to New York, where he began his jazz career in earnest and received a master’s in music education from the Manhattan School of Music.His musical pursuits were paralleled by a lifelong interest in education. He taught jazz at Howard, North Carolina Central University, Rutgers, Cornell, the University of Delaware and Delaware State University, and also studied law. In 1982 he received a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia University. He spent many years, at various institutions, teaching a curriculum that integrated math and music education.In 2000 Mr. Byrd was given a Jazz Masters award by the National Endowment for the Arts.Mr. Byrd had homes in Dover, Del., and Teaneck, N.J. Information on his survivors was not available.In his 1998 Cornell lecture Mr. Byrd said he had been inspired by musicians who changed music, notably John Coltrane.“I met him in the 11th grade in Detroit,” he said. “I skipped school one day to see Dizzy Gillespie, and that’s where I met Coltrane. Coltrane and Jimmy Heath just joined the band, and I brought my trumpet, and he was sitting at the piano downstairs waiting to join Dizzy’s band. He had his saxophone across his lap, and he looked at me and he said, ‘You want to play?’“So he played piano, and I soloed. I never thought that six years later we would be recording together, and that we would be doing all of this stuff. The point is that you never know what happens in life.”"
https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/arts/music/grammy-voters-reward-sounds-of-the-past.html,"Imagine, if you will, the Grammy Awards of 2045. The winners will be a diverse lot: young pop-rappers who sound like suburban Wiz Khalifas; dance-music producers using the dubstep drop ironically; all manner of Taylor Swift revivalists; pop-R&B-hip-hop hybridizers who sample Drake, maybe Mumford & Sons.And what a mistake all that will be.That’s because the voters will by and large be the artists, producers, engineers and more of today — which means that there will be representatives from rock, and also teen-pop, hip-hop, dance music and so on (provided that the current generation of Grammy voters doesn’t exclude them with voter fraud measures).And think of the complaints future generations of critics will lodge: the Grammys favor familiar modes! Youthful innovation is not being rewarded!Complaining about the Grammys is perennial and inevitable, because the structure of the award giving, which is flawed, is also etched in stone: the representatives of yesteryear weighing in on the acts of today.The systemic issues in the Grammy voting pool are unlikely to change: younger artists and industry professionals will, in general, participate less, as will artists from less-established genres, whatever those might be three decades from now. Older voters will continue to vote long after they are past their peak relevance.That means that generally the voters with the most time and energy invested in voting will be the ones with the least time and energy invested in current music making. There will almost certainly never be harmony between those who make the music and those who determine its Grammy fate.Why complain, then? One, the historical record matters. For better or for worse, the Grammy tally will be used as a measuring stick for future generations to understand the past, and when it’s flawed, as it reliably is, it disrupts the proper writing of history.What’s more, there remains a serious misalignment between the shape, scale and range of what popular music is and what the Grammys capture. They remain boneheaded about hip-hop, R&B and country, a point they proved this year with their showering of riches upon the full spectrum of vanguard-free rock bands. The garage-rock revivalists Black Keys won three awards, for best rock performance, best rock song and best rock album, and the group member Dan Auerbach won for producer of the year, nonclassical. The Queen imitators Fun won best new artist and song of the year, and the Peter Gabriel-manqué Gotye won record of the year, best pop duo/group performance, and best alternative music album. The Dust Bowl fetishists Mumford & Sons won album of the year, the night’s top prize.It was the award ceremony equivalent of spreading bets on a roulette table or giving out participation ribbons at a summer camp track meet. But while those acts are all young, or youngish, they unfailingly hew to old styles, dating back in some cases to the 1930s. If the Grammy narrative is to be believed, the last time there was musical innovation worthy of celebration was the mid-1980s, which may well line up with the prime creative period of many Grammy voters.Not coincidentally, hip-hop and dance music, which reached their commercial primes more recently (or are still ascendant), were shut out of the main category nominations: Jay-Z, Kanye West and Skrillex won three awards each in the genre categories, and Drake won one. Also, the lone hip-hop performance was the night’s closing set, which included Chuck D of Public Enemy and LL Cool J, rappers two decades past their peak relevance, or, in other words, Grammy-voter manna.The primary, loosely construed exception to the forward-looking nomination freeze-out was the R&B singer Frank Ocean, who was nominated six times and won twice, including for best urban contemporary album, a new category that in no way correlates to an actual genre, and feels as if it were invented so that Mr. Ocean might win something on his own — his other award was for best rap/sung collaboration, with Jay-Z, Mr. West and The-Dream — without disrupting the reign of rock. Additionally, the silky R&B singer Miguel was nominated for song of the year, and the pop-country wunderkind Taylor Swift was nominated for record of the year; both lost.Adele won best pop solo performance for the second year running, for a live version of a song released a year earlier, beating Kelly Clarkson, Katy Perry, Rihanna and Carly Rae Jepsen in what was either pure travesty or the richest parody in Grammy history. Do Grammy voters receive a shock every time they vote for someone other than Adele?Unlike, say, the Oscars, where expensive awards campaigns can tilt voters in a film’s direction, the Grammys appear largely impervious to influence, reasonable or otherwise. (An exception was the unknown Al Walser, nominated in the best dance recording category, who gamed the system by convincing out-of-touch Grammy voters that he was a legitimate contender.)That means that the structural problems will remain. (This year’s broadcast drew 28.37 million viewers, the second-best ratings since 1993, though down from last year’s 39.9 million.) Compound that with the woeful and clunky arrangement of performances, which serves to compress as many faces as possible into allotted time slots. Some younger stars were given a big platform, like Mr. Ocean, Ms. Swift and Rihanna. But many were effectively supervised by an older peer — Ed Sheeran with Elton John, Bruno Mars with Sting — or put in service of tribute, like Zac Brown, Mumford & Sons and Brittany Howard of Alabama Shakes, all part of the Levon Helm celebration. And plenty were altogether excluded: Drake, Justin Bieber, Nicki Minaj, Mr. West and so on.What’s left is an impression that the generation of musicians genuinely driving pop into a bolder future isn’t to be trusted. History will frown on this. And the future is likely to repeat it."
