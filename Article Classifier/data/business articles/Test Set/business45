ECONOMIC growth remained sluggish and politics often intruded on the markets, yet stocks achieved solid returns last year all the same. It wasn’t the first time that investors scaled a wall of worry, but it might be the only instance when the main source of concern, at least in the fourth quarter, was thought to be a cliff.The Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index rose 13.4 percent for the year, even with a 1 percent decline in the fourth quarter. In those last months, doubts rose about whether Congress and President Obama could reach an agreement on taxes and spending in time to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff — and the recession that was thought to lie below.The drama in Washington was one of several throughout the year that kept investors focused more on capitols than corporate boardrooms. European leaders were continually devising plans to rescue the euro and some of the economies that use it, and China underwent a change of leadership.Although the fourth-quarter loss was worse soon after Election Day and stocks raced ahead at the start of the new year, investors’ concerns may yet prove well founded. The immediate concerns related to taxes were resolved only at the 11th hour — just past midnight, really — and much remains to be sorted out on spending. Investment advisers said that politics, at home and abroad, would continue to guide markets.“The political environment and uncertainty revolving around policy decisions has been a really big factor,” said Jeremy DeGroot, chief investment officer of the fund provider Litman Gregory. “There are significant deficit issues that developed economies are facing, and the markets are hanging on every development.”One bit of uncertainty was eliminated on Jan. 1, when Congress agreed to limit the scope of scheduled tax increases, although the deal still resulted in higher tax rates on payrolls, dividends and capital gains.Worries also abated when European Union finance ministers agreed in the fourth quarter to place big banks under the supervision of the European Central Bank. That followed the bank’s announcement that it would support the bond markets of weaker economies, which are concentrated along the region’s southern periphery.THE moves on both sides of the Atlantic helped stock funds achieve modest fourth-quarter gains. The average domestic fund in Morningstar’s database rose 0.9 percent. International funds fared better, up 4.8 percent, on average, with portfolios that focus on European stocks returning 7.4 percent and emerging-market funds rising 6.2 percent. Full-year returns exceeded 14 percent for all four categories.Yields on short- and long-term debt remained low all year as the Federal Reserve and other central banks maintained the easy monetary policies in force since the 2008 crisis. While that could account for much of stocks’ strength during 2012, the influence on bond returns, at least on high-quality government issues, may be waning.The average bond fund rose a healthy 8.4 percent on the year, but the fourth-quarter gain was a slim 1.3 percent, dragged lower by a 1.1 percent loss for portfolios of long-term government bonds. High-yield bond funds rose 3.1 percent for the quarter, on average, and funds that specialize in debt issued in emerging economies gained 3.9 percent.Just how helpful low interest rates were for economic growth is hard to discern. American economic output has continued to expand at a sluggish pace. And Europe is widely seen to be in recession.“The trend of deterioration in Europe is not slowing down,” said Virginie Maisonneuve, head of global and international equities at Schroder Investment Management. She noted, though, that some indicators suggested that conditions were stabilizing at very low levels along the continent’s troubled southern fringe.Whatever the economic impact of low interest rates, they seem to be helping corporate America. Corporate debt issuance last year exceeded $1 trillion for the first time.Increased indebtedness provides leverage that lifts profit margins, said Jeremy Grantham, chief investment strategist of the fund management company GMO. Margins have reached record levels as a proportion of economic output and are “weirdly high,” in his opinion, “unless we’re in one of those wonderful secular shifts that people talk about but almost never see.” He doesn’t glimpse any such new normal, however, and cites high margins as a reason to be cautious about most stocks.Rising debt of another kind is a pressing concern for many investors. With the national debt above $16 trillion, the second part of the fiscal cliff debate, focusing on spending cuts, is expected to be played out over the next month or so in Washington.This could have higher stakes for the economy and markets and cause more acrimony than the haggling over tax rates. That’s because the debt ceiling — the limit imposed by Congress on the government’s borrowing authority — has been reached again. The concern is that Republicans will withhold approval to raise the ceiling without meaningful spending cuts. A similar battle in 2011 led to a downgrade of Treasury debt and was the catalyst for a violent stock market decline.“We know there’s going to be another fight around the debt ceiling in February,” said Tobias Levkovich, chief United States equity strategist for Citigroup. “We avoided plummeting off the cliff, but we haven’t avoided more cliffs in the future.”THE immediate outlook for financial markets depends on how the next cliff is navigated. An overhaul of programs like Social Security and Medicare, combined with a revamping of the tax code in a so-called grand bargain, would set spending on a gentler slope for the long term without abrupt cuts now, investment advisers said. But some, like Mr. DeGroot, were not holding their breath.“We have to have a credible medium- to long-term plan to bring down the excess of spending over revenues, but politicians are usually not ones to make those tough decisions until they’re forced to,” he said. “It usually takes a market disruption to force their hand. Kicking the can is an easier, less painful approach. At some point, do investors say they don’t see a resolution to this?”Mr. DeGroot finds little to recommend to investors, though he does see opportunity in foreign stocks, particularly in emerging economies. Better still, he said, are so-called unconstrained bond funds whose managers have great flexibility in how they invest.Mr. Grantham also finds emerging stock markets appealing, along with Japan and “cheap European value stocks,” and he advises longer-term investors to consider commodity and energy stocks. As for the United States, he judges the market overvalued and recommends only high-quality companies.Sometimes, all it takes to do better is to avoid doing worse. Ms. Maisonneuve said investors in Europe, for example, had begun to recognize that if the region “is leaving behind its near-death experience, then equity valuations are very attractive, compared to fixed income.” A recovery in Chinese and American growth could help Europe “continue to heal itself,” she added.As for sectors, she particularly favors global health care, which can profit from drug sales to emerging economies, and cyclical industrial companies and commodity providers that would benefit from resurgent Chinese growth. She also likes financial service companies but is avoiding European banks.Investors fixated last year on so-called tail risks, or potential negative surprises. But what if 2013 offered some head risks? Such positive surprises wouldn’t faze Francis Scotland, director of global macro research at Brandywine Global.“I think people are looking in the wrong direction,” Mr. Scotland said. “There is a risk that something might actually go right. I think we’re in a sweet spot. Let’s assume we take most of the sting out of the fiscal cliff. Just the clarity will improve the corporate sector outlook. There’s a real case for the economy to grow above trend in the first half. It’s time to move to a more risk-oriented strategy.”While he is happy to advocate for the American economy and likes domestic market sectors like consumer discretionary and financial services, Mr. Scotland prefers to take risks elsewhere. He recommends bonds in peripheral European countries like Italy and Ireland; investment-grade emerging bond markets like Mexico, Poland and South Africa; and Japanese, Chinese and European stocks.“You could make a case for all of these markets doing well, relative to the U.S.,” he said.MR. LEVKOVICH makes the case for American stocks doing well. He says he expects the S. &P. 500 to rise 13 percent this year, to 1,615. He agrees with Mr. Scotland that “there’s a bunch of good news out there.”“Housing has improved, and job trends should improve based on surveys and credit growth,” Mr. Levkovich said. “There’s an energy boom in places like Montana and South Dakota that is growing more jobs, and manufacturing competitiveness is developing in this country; it’s cheaper to build a plant and produce goods in South Carolina than in Shenzhen.”Even though he is hopeful about 2013, Mr. Levkovich acknowledged that investors might want to wait until Washington produced a deal that averts the next fiscal cliff before they focus on the more pleasant landscape beyond it.“We’ve got this positive dynamic,” he said. “The biggest constraint we’re facing is the fiscal issue and dysfunctional government.”
