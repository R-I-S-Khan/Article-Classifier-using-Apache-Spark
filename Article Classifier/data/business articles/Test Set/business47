A  PORTFOLIO balanced between stocks and bonds, in a roughly 60-40 split, is a staple diet of investing. These two asset classes often move to different rhythms, so overall returns tend to have milder swings than either one experiences on its own.But this conventional mix may not be as appealing as it used to be, some investment advisers say. Bonds are extremely overvalued with yields at multiyear lows, they say, and while they view stocks as more reasonably priced, they acknowledge that the ups and downs of the last few months are liable to rattle investors’ nerves.What can be done? Some advisers suggest adding fresh ingredients to a portfolio, by buying so-called core-plus funds that hold a broader variety of assets. Others recommend sticking patiently with the traditional recipe. But either way, they warn, investors should prepare for something that may be less palatable than they are accustomed to.“This is not a great time to be investing in anything right now due to volatility in the markets and the enormous amount of macroeconomic uncertainty,” said Harold Ratner, a senior investment strategist at Morningstar. “Across the board, nothing is screamingly attractive.”But if investors have the luxury of staying fully invested, Mr. Ratner doesn’t consider the two main asset classes ugly enough to suggest abandoning conventional balanced funds. If investors are saving for retirement or another long-term goal, then owning the funds “is probably an O.K. thing to do,” he said, adding that “the world has not changed that much in the last five or six years that you would need to change your strategy.”Someone who is more adventurous, or more sensitive to changing market conditions, might look at core-plus funds, he said. Although these vehicles keep a large majority of their assets in stocks and bonds, they also invest in alternatives like commodities, real estate investment trusts or hedge fund strategies. Depending on how they invest, Morningstar will classify them as “conservative allocation,” “moderate allocation,” “aggressive allocation” or “world allocation” funds, all niches in the balanced-fund category.Rob Arnott, chairman and chief executive of the investment advisory service Research Affiliates, is among those who say it’s time to branch out from conventional funds. He tells investors that they “urgently need to build a third pillar.”In Mr. Arnott’s opinion, an investment in alternatives is wise in the interest of diversification and risk reduction, but if inflation flares up down the road, as he expects, it would worsen the outlook for stocks and bonds enough to warrant particularly large allocations elsewhere.“Stocks and bonds are going to be a big mistake for years,” he said. “Do yourself the favor of building a modest third pillar that can protect you” against inflation.Bonds perform poorly in an inflationary environment, something that Mr. Arnott expects as a result of very loose monetary policy, he explained, and valuations on stocks fall because inflation generally sends interest rates higher.The drawback to expanding beyond the two main classes now is that alternative assets have joined them in the mainstream, said Christopher Cordaro, chief investment officer of RegentAtlantic Capital, a financial planning firm in Morristown, N.J. Many investors have been buying such alternatives to the point that they may have become overvalued.“With bond yields at all-time lows, investors are looking elsewhere for yield,” Mr. Cordaro said. “They’re pouring money into REITs, commodities and hedge funds. This is not the time to get too fancy. I think investors are taking on a huge amount of risk and not realizing it.”One evergreen risk of owning any balanced fund stems from the difficulty of knowing what it contains. One portfolio that holds only stocks and bonds might be limited to blue chips and investment-grade bond issues, said Mr. Ratner, the Morningstar strategist, while another might reach into emerging markets, small-company stocks and high-yield corporate debt. When a portfolio starts adding alternative assets, the complexity only climbs from there.The mix might include some holdings that investors would prefer to avoid, advisers say, but because managers report holdings only intermittently, shareholders don’t always know what’s coming or going from their funds.Then there is the matter of management quality. An investor who buys a balanced fund, other than one that passively tracks stock and bond indexes, is placing faith in a manager’s ability to be a jack-of-all-trades — or at least a jack-of-two-trades.“I’m generally not a big fan of balanced funds because I like to control the mix,” said Kent Kramer, a partner of the Foster Group, a financial planning firm in West Des Moines, Iowa.He would rather own separate portfolios to gain exposure to various kinds of stocks and bonds.“The vast majority of investors are going to have a better experience and probably with a lot less cost” with a more limited mix of assets, he said. “ ‘Souped up’ sometimes really means more expensive, and I don’t know if you’re getting bang for the buck.”He advises investors who are interested in balanced funds to start the search with Vanguard, a fund provider known for low expenses. “With Vanguard, you get a good explanation of the fees, and the fees are low,” he said.The Vanguard Balanced Index fund seeks to replicate the MSCI U.S. Broad Market Index of stocks and the Barclays Capital U.S. Aggregate Float Adjusted Index of bonds in the traditional 60-40 ratio. It has annual expenses of 0.24 percent and gets four stars from Morningstar and a gold rating in the firm’s more subjective analyst rating system.Core-plus funds favored by Morningstar analysts include T. Rowe Price Capital Appreciation and Leuthold Core Investment. The Price fund, which gets five stars and a gold rating, the highest on both scales, holds domestic and foreign stocks and conventional bonds, along with convertible bonds, preferred stocks and leveraged loans. The Leuthold fund, with four stars and a silver rating, likewise owns domestic and foreign stocks and bonds, as well as REITs and gold.MR. RATNER encourages investors in balanced funds to consider buying not just one, but rather a handful of them, and to make sure that each holds assets in different proportions, even if the assets are just stocks and bonds. If they seek funds whose managers prefer more assets or more trading among them, he added, they should remember that more doesn’t necessarily mean better.“Investors need to make sure that they’re comfortable with these additional risks,” he said, “and that the managers can add value.”
