WHEN the financial crisis erupted several years ago, its victims included lenders to the weakest and most debt-laden companies. Investors in junk-bond mutual funds suffered a negative return of roughly 25 percent in 2008.But since then, Federal Reserve policies have flattened interest rates, punishing savers with yields that don’t even keep up with inflation. With little incentive to park money in bank certificates of deposit, yield-starved investors have sought out riskier instruments.This quest for yield has been a boon to the below-investment-grade debt known as junk or high-yield bonds. Issuance of such bonds — those ranked BB or lower — set a record last year, according to Standard & Poor’s. “Even the lowest-rated issuer has access to capital markets,” said Diane Vazza, head of global fixed-income research at S.& P.As the capital-raising prospects brightened for such companies, so did the fortunes of their bondholders. Junk bonds have produced an average annual total return of nearly 19 percent over the last four years, Ms. Vazza reported. In 2012, high-yield mutual funds trailed only emerging-market funds among all fixed-income sectors, producing total returns of more than 14 percent, according to Morningstar.“The Fed is winning,” said Elaine Stokes, co-manager of the Loomis Sayles High Income fund. “You’re not making anything by leaving money in the bank. High-yield has been a clear net winner.”Of course, the past is only sometimes prologue in the fickle financial markets. Many high-yield portfolio managers caution against expectations of repeat double-digit returns this year.“It’s hard to get really excited by U.S. high-yield or high-yield globally, given the huge run-up it’s had,” Ms. Stokes said.Andrew Feltus, lead manager of the Pioneer Global High Yield fund, and Darren Hughes, co-manager of the Invesco High Yield fund, foresee returns of 6 to 7 percent this year for junk bonds in general.Of course, that’s awfully good when the alternative is a bank certificate of deposit that may yield a sliver of 1 percent. Even 10-year Treasuries return less than 2 percent.Is the world so topsy-turvy that risky investments are a sure bet to at least triple the safest investments?Maybe.But junk-bond buyers should remember that they face some serious risks. One is the risk of default. For speculative issues, the default rate is currently low, just 2.7 percent. Even if it ticks higher, as S.& P. expects, to 3.7 percent in 2013, that’s still below the 30-year historical norm of 4.5 percent. So defaults probably shouldn’t cost investors “much more than one percentage point in total return” this year, said James Keenan, lead portfolio manager of the BlackRock High Yield Bond Portfolio.The bigger risk may be a decline in bond prices. Rising interest rates are typically the lurking natural enemy of bond prices. But with the Fed adamantly holding rates down, that seems an unlikely ambush for now.More worrisome is the prospect of an economic downturn. “The risks of the high-yield market declining in price are tied to the risks of recession,” Mr. Keenan said.But even without a recession, the prices of junk-bond investments could tumble if investors decided for any number of reasons to move their money out of the category.One such catalyst would be a sharp pickup in the economic recovery. A more robust recovery would produce an “acceleration of earnings growth” that would drive investors out of bonds and into stocks, Mr. Hughes of Invesco said.That’s why market watchers pay close attention to fund flows: the streams of money coming in and out of investment sectors. For most of 2012, junk bonds have been fund-flow magnets. But there have been recent signs of reversal. High-yield mutual funds had outflows of cash in September, November and December, and high-yield exchange-traded funds had outflows in October and November.“The greatest risk is rotation out of high-yield into equities as a result of an improving economy and improving earnings,” Ms. Stokes said.Fund managers, meanwhile, wonder whether the sectors that performed so well last year will lead again in 2013.Housing and building materials, among the strongest sectors last year, were big winners for the Invesco fund. “We’ve been pretty bullish on the housing recovery and it’s worked well,” Mr. Hughes said. The fund holds credits of the homebuilder Hovnanian Enterprises, as well as Nortek, which makes residential heating, cooling and ventilation products.At Pioneer Global High Yield, Mr. Feltus notes that European credits were very strong performers last year. But in 2013, he sees potential for currency gains to bolster returns in several emerging markets. “Mexico’s might be the best-performing currency next year,” Mr. Feltus said. He also sees potential gains in the currencies of Malaysia and the Philippines.Mr. Feltus emphasizes the importance of credit analysis in sifting through high-yield debt issues. “You’ve got to do your homework,” he said.Fund managers, of course, are always aware of the credit ratings issued by an agency like S.& P. or Moody’s, But Mr. Hughes also says it’s important to dig further. “The agencies may be wrong,” he said. ““We do our own credit analysis.”FOR investors torn between a hunger for return and a need for safety, high-yield will always pose a conundrum. “This is a very risky asset class,” said Sarah Bush, an analyst at Morningstar. “There’s a lot of credit risk. This is not a place you should think of as a safe place for your money.”On the other hand, as Ms. Stokes says, investors are making little money by leaving it in the bank.Similarly, Mr. Keenan said, “I think 6 to 7 percent returns are going to look pretty good at the end of 2013.”
