To many politicians, the deal that raised taxes on the wealthy and averted the fiscal cliff was a sellout, a cop-out, a Band-Aid — in short, nothing good. And now the debt ceiling showdown is looming. So why have stock investors cheered, pushing the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index to five-year highs?My annual survey suggests that investment experts are cautiously upbeat about the economy and the stock market (but not bonds) for 2013, even though they acknowledge that political dysfunction in Washington poses risks. The tax deal may have upset Tea Party Republicans looking for big cuts in entitlement spending and liberals demanding even bigger tax increases on the wealthy. But investors seem to be taking the long view that the warring factions did in the end reach a deal, and it amounts to a $4 trillion stimulus compared with what would have happened if Congress had done nothing. Stimulus may be a bad word in Washington, but many investors seem to believe that continued deficit spending and only a modest tax increase will be good for the economy and corporate profits, at least this year.The experts I consulted a year ago — Bill Miller for stocks, Bill Gross for bonds and Karl E. Case for real estate — proved accurate in their predictions for 2012. So I asked them for a return engagement. I also spoke to Byron Wien, vice chairman and a senior adviser at Blackstone. Last year, Mr. Wien was one of the few pundits who was exactly right about the stock market, predicting that the S.& P. 500 would close the year “over 1,400.” The index ended the year at 1,426, a gain of 13.4 percent for the year.Bill Miller: ‘The great bond bear market has begun’ Perhaps the biggest comeback of 2012 belongs to Mr. Miller of Legg Mason, who became a mutual fund legend by beating the S.& P. 500 for 15 consecutive years, from 1991 to 2005. Then, during 2008 and the financial panic, he seemingly lost his magic touch. His fund plunged 55 percent. The Wall Street Journal, in its headline about the fund’s dismal returns, spoke of his “defeat.” And after another disappointing year in 2011, he retired as head of the Legg Mason Value Trust, the firm’s flagship fund.But Mr. Miller kept his hand in the market, managing the much smaller Legg Mason Capital Management Opportunity Trust. When I sought him out a year ago, reasoning that even the most brilliant investors can be expected to have a few bad years, he was bullish on stocks. That proved good advice. Mr. Miller’s fund gained over 40 percent in 2012, and was the top-performing mutual fund in Morningstar’s database. How did he do it?Mr. Miller made big bets on the battered and out-of-favor homebuilding and financial sectors, the kind of contrarian strategy that served him well for so many years. Major holdings like Pulte Homes (which gained 160 percent over the past year) and Bank of America (which nearly doubled) were some his best-performing stocks.Mr. Miller remains optimistic about stocks for 2013, with an asterisk. When I reached him this week, he offered these predictions: “The great bond bear market has begun, starting with Treasuries, which should see years of losses as interest rates gradually normalize. Equities, which outperformed bonds in 2012, will continue to do well, driven by rising earnings, strong free cash flow, solid profit margins, low inflation and attractive valuation relative to bonds. The path of least resistance for stocks and the economy is higher. The chief risk is the dysfunctional political environment, which could derail what otherwise is a very promising outlook.”Mr. Wien, whose long career on Wall Street included stints at Morgan Stanley and Pequot Capital, told me he’s “gloomy” about prospects in Washington. “We can’t solve our problems simply by getting the rich to pay more. We have to broaden the tax base, revise the tax code and tackle the structural problems we aren’t facing. We need to deal with entitlements. The latest deal did absolutely nothing to address that. I don’t know if democracy can solve these problems.”Despite his success at predicting the market last year, Mr. Wien isn’t putting a number on the S.& P. 500 this year, but his expectations are modest. He expects the S.& P. 500 to test 1,300 at some point, which would be about a 10 percent decline from current levels, before ending the year about where it is now. “I don’t expect the stock market to do much this year,” he said. “Most analysts are forecasting returns of 10 percent or more, but I think earnings could be down for the year, which would make it hard for the market to gain that much.”But he’s optimistic about stock markets in some other countries, especially China, where stocks lagged last year, and Japan, which has been in the doldrums for years. He’s forecasting a 20 percent gain this year for Chinese shares. Bill Gross:  ‘Ashes in our stocking’After a rough 2011, Mr. Gross, the highly regarded bond expert and a founder of the investment firm Pimco, bounced back last year. Pimco’s Total Return Fund, which Mr. Gross manages, returned over 10 percent in 2012, a year when short-term Treasury bonds were yielding close to zero. A year ago, he told me that tax-free municipal bonds, which he termed a “deserted” asset class because of widespread fears of municipal bankruptcies, would provide healthy returns. He was right: municipal bond returns averaged over 7 percent last year, and some bonds earned double-digit returnsBut Mr. Gross is far more muted now. “I’m afraid there are going to be ashes in our stocking this year,” he said, “and that applies to almost all asset classes. Bonds are priced not just for perfection, but with close to 0 percent yields. The juice has been squeezed out of the orange. You just can’t get to 10 percent returns.”Will 2013 be the year that interest rates in the United States finally start to rise, which could devastate returns for fixed-income investors? (Bond prices move inversely to interest rates.) A growing number of experts (including Mr. Miller) think so, but not Mr. Gross. “I don’t see a lot of risk in bonds,” Mr. Gross said. “The Federal Reserve is buying, and there’s no real risk until the Fed declares the war is over. It’s looking for 6.5 percent unemployment. By any reasonable standard, that’s going to be a long time coming — certainly not in 2013, and probably not for at least two to three more years.”Mr. Gross likes bonds from emerging market countries as well as from Italy and Spain. And for conservative investors who prize safety, he recommends Treasury Inflation Protected Bonds, or TIPs, even though their nominal yields are minuscule. “I like countries like Brazil and Mexico especially,” he said. “They have half the debt the United States does relative to G.D.P. They have much better growth prospects. Mexican bonds yield about 6 percent and Brazil is at 8.5 percent. And an emerging market bond fund that holds countries like this would be attractive.” Karl Case:  ‘A lot of reasons  to be optimistic’Last year will probably go down as the year that residential real estate prices hit bottom and began to rise after the collapse that began in 2007. This came as no surprise to Mr. Case, an emeritus professor of economics at Wellesley College. Mr. Case’s name is practically synonymous with real estate values, since he helped create the widely cited S.& P. Case-Shiller Index of housing prices (along with the Yale economics professor Robert Shiller). A year ago, he told me it was a “terrific” time to buy a house.He was right, at least for most cities. Last month, Standard & Poor’s reported that its Case-Shiller 20-city composite index showed a 4.5 percent gain. Prices in hard-hit Phoenix have now gained for 13 consecutive months. And even in New York City, which along with Chicago was one of just two markets where average prices dropped in 2012, prices of high-end properties hit records, a trend Mr. Case expects to continue.“Phoenix is amazing,” Mr. Case said last week. “California is strong, and it’s doing what it’s done in every other cycle, which is important, because California makes up one-fourth of the housing value in the United States. But residential real estate is not going to go up like a rocket ship.”That’s because the slump was so severe that expectations for homeownership have been sharply lowered. Talk in Washington of eliminating or curbing the mortgage deduction in the name of tax reform is weighing on prices. And Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, both taxpayer-supported, are still guaranteeing most mortgages, which isn’t sustainable, he said.As a result, “the recovery won’t be anything like we’ve seen in the past,” Mr. Case predicted. “We’re cheering because we got to 800,000 housing starts. That’s still weak. It only looks good because we dug ourselves into such a deep hole.” But real estate tends to move in longer cycles, and Mr. Case is still saying now is a good time to buy. “There are a lot of reasons to be optimistic, but cautiously so,” he said.
