Income, Taxes and MathTo the Editor:In “Bad Math and the Middle Class” (Economic View, Dec. 30), N. Gregory Mankiw says that tax and income data “suggest that the rich are not, as a general matter, shirking their responsibilities to support the federal government,” and that “the current tax system looks plenty progressive.”First, Mr. Mankiw never mentions that many taxes in our society — like sales and gasoline taxes — are regressive. Second, he sets the bar for tax fairness way too low. The growth of income inequality since the Reagan administration shows that Congress went too far in abolishing high-income tax brackets — a revenue source that we need if we are ever to pay for two wars lasting 11 years.A progressive tax system should maintain or reduce income inequality so that our society is more of a meritocracy than a plutocracy. Roger FriedmanDecatur, Ga., Dec. 30To the Editor:In the long run, most all Americans are likely to face higher taxes, thus broadening the base, but let’s remember that taxes haven’t solely been used for the purpose of raising revenue or reducing debt. The tax structure in America over the past 30 years has clearly been a major component of a sharp shift in the nation’s wealth.  Lowered tax rates on income and dramatically reduced rates on investment income have skewed the system in favor the already wealthy, and the implications will impact our national fiscal well-being for years to come. Kevin Kobalter, M.D.San Rafael, Calif., Dec. 30To the Editor:Lamenting the growth of the United States deficit, Professor Mankiw blames higher spending on entitlement programs like Medicare — spending that is  driven, he argues, by “new technology, which extends and improves the quality of life, but often at a high cost.”Such views are hard to stomach after reading “Finding Profits, at $28,000 a Vial” in your section the same day. That article described a company that paid $100,000 for the rights to a drug developed decades ago, increased the price of the drug overnight to $23,000 from $1,650 a vial (and now to more than $28,000), has manufacturing costs that account for only 1 percent of the drug’s price — and saw the drug’s sales total nearly $350 million in the first nine months of 2012.Rather than cut Medicare benefits, wouldn’t it make more sense to rein in sky-high prices for drugs?François FurstenbergMontreal, Dec. 30To the Editor:Professor Mankiw attributes much of America’s federal deficit to the growth in entitlement spending, but why doesn’t he mention the cost of the wars that the nation has waged?Policy makers have presumably known all along that the population would age and that health care costs would increase. Rather than factoring those truths into the budget, they chose to wage wars of choice. Is that the citizens’ fault? I don’t think so. Carol WheelerSan Miguel de Allende,Mexico, Dec. 30
