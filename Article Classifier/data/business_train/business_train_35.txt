WITH drama fiscal policy Congress White House easy miss quiet policy evolution taking place nearby Federal Reserve The central bank adopted aggressive monetary policy could helpful recovering economy But internal debate Fed may weaken program really gets ground First Fed done recently Until September bond buying program explicitly limited size duration Fed policy makers replaced open ended program whose pace determined progress healing labor market And adopted simpler positive explanations actions jettisoning gloomy expectations killing language cited wretched economic prospects justify every expansionary move Then December Fed surprised markets replacing somewhat confusing predictions interest rates numerical guidelines It said would keep rate controls federal funds rate near zero least unemployment rate fell 6 5 percent inflation rose 2 5 percent Under circumstances significant policy makers took actions The economic data came September meeting actually better expected And based forecasts released meeting members Fed policy making committee slightly optimistic prospects employment output growth three months That nevertheless adopted expansionary policy read admission enough earlier The pledge keep rates low even inflation edged 2 percent particularly consequential For last several years Fed acted 2 percent target ceiling never breached But coming terrible recession unemployment excruciatingly high period rapid growth needed repair damage surprising growth push inflation bit 2 percent A Fed acknowledgment 2 5 percent inflation would tolerable short sign lost commitment price stability Instead strong statement committed ensuring faster recovery The positive language along whatever takes approach bond buying seems designed reassure Americans conditions improve This important With short term rates close zero Fed main tool expectations management If persuade people expect growth yes little inflation may help encourage companies stop sitting cash start investing The new policies improvements I want oversell As I suggested previous column definitive policy shift like adopting new target monetary policy would likely greater impact expectations stimulating recovery And new policy numerical parameters conservative According Fed assessments normal unemployment longer run well 6 5 percent If inflation remains low unemployment gets 6 5 percent reason rush raise interest rates The pressing problem though Fed commitment new policies appears shaky Soon December meeting members policy making committee spoke action killing positive buzz created policy statement spirited news conference Fed chairman Ben S Bernanke Also minutes December meeting showed voted new guidance fed funds rate skeptical complementary action bond buying No one Fed recent actions particularly powerful together create sense aggressive expansion commitment recovery If Fed stops giving public mixed message positive effect expectations could easily evaporate So Fed moved slowly policy makers threatening undo recent actions In recent paper Prof David Romer University California Berkeley husband I found pessimistic views effectiveness costs expansionary actions played major role limiting Fed moves last years Policy makers worry actions little good could cause inflation distortions financial markets losses Fed portfolio I say sure views wrong today We enough experience situations like current one conclusive evidence one way But paper shows two periods Fed made terrible errors kinds pessimistic views present Faced Great Depression early 1930s high inflation early late 1970s monetary policy makers little convinced action would ineffective Subsequent events proved decisions wrong In 1930s propitious gold inflow allowed administration Franklin D Roosevelt conduct monetary expansion without Fed Real interest rates plummeted expectations improved investment spending consumer purchases durable goods took jump starting recovery At end 1970s new Fed chairman Paul A Volcker concluded monetary policy absolutely could reduce inflation led Fed raise interest rates historic highs The recession followed painful inflation come low ever since WHEN monetary policy makers meet end month keep historical lessons mind At least Cassandras committee might want reread policy record 1930s The degree sound like Depression era counterparts might shock give pause The Fed new aggressive policy shows every sign helpful indications feared costs materializing So rather trimming policy bear fruit give chance Even better give extra oomph Rather continuing bond buying program accelerate somewhat Instead reiterating numerical guidelines funds rate policy makers could follow suggestion Narayana Kocherlakota president Federal Reserve Bank Minneapolis lower 5 5 percent unemployment level Fed starts consider raising interest rates And Mr Bernanke wanted truly aggressive could broach idea weak economy strong dollar necessarily desirable The important thing hypothetical fears stop Fed evolution History side standing sidelines
