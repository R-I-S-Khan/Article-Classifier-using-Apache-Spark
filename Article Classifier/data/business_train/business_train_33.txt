precision Higher inflation could accelerate economic growth job creation encouraging people spend make riskier investments Yet annualized inflation fell 1 3 percent December asset prices reflect expectation pace remain well 2 percent next decade By framework enough said Justin Wolfers economist University Michigan They said going expand economy keep inflation around 2 percent done The rest government making task difficult Federal spending cuts tax increases prospect cuts March 1 hurting growth The Fed chairman Ben S Bernanke warned repeatedly monetary policy cannot offset fiscal austerity And likely latest economic data reflect full impact Fed efforts Despite rise unemployment job creation increased recent months consumer spending strengthened housing market healing Partly monetary policy slow acting forecasters expect modest growth year But Fed also acting clear measure restraint Mr Bernanke officials made clear believe central bank could increase pace inflation bolster growth job creation They simply persuaded benefits outweigh potential costs particular risk efforts distort asset prices seed future financial crises The Fed constrained part already done much

billion month purchases Well number twice large 85 twice large said Professor Wolfers It clear But keep saying one thing another That reluctance ultimately reflects enduring conviction many Fed officials important responsibility maintaining stable inflation long run When inflation rises unpredictably disrupts economic activity making impossible companies tell difference increased demand
