As search cause smoldering batteries Boeing grounded 787 Dreamliner continues investigators Congressional oversight committees may want look related potentially sensitive issue Japanese company GS Yuasa chosen manufacture innovative suspect lithium ion batteries 787 No one claimed GS Yuasa chosen 787 anything merit But Boeing long dogged suspicions return awarding major contracts Japanese companies also receive subsidies Japan government country airlines buy Boeing aircraft almost exclusively Such arrangements banned World Trade Organization Agreement Trade Civil Aircraft signed United States Japan requires aircraft purchases made solely basis commercial technological factors procurement contracts entered basis competitive price quality delivery The agreement intended ensure purchase decisions based strictly technical commercial factors according United States trade representative The world made tremendous progress eliminating political influence sale aircraft components Richard L Aboulafia aerospace aviation analyst Teal Group consulting firm Washington told week And Japan All normal ways things upended Is quid pro quo Yes absolutely But one talk one prove said A former Boeing executive confirmed spoke week After asking named diplomatic fragility topic said Let put way knew Japanese market would Boeing return selecting Japanese partners It silent understanding nothing writing He added Boeing Japanese suppliers received low interest loans Japanese government repayable future profits Although Japanese airlines suppliers independent companies Japan unique relationship airlines suppliers government according former Boeing official It cultural The officials went schools close personal relationships The government supported airlines industries developed together The government enormous influence They work together As Boeing vice president former Boeing Japan president Nicole Piasecki told company magazine 2008 These relationships people business The Japanese government powerful important part economic activity industrial development So part relationship building negotiating two important spheres influence Japan understanding tied together Mr Aboulafia agreed Japan unique This way things used days free trade said Japan last unreconstructed believer industrial policy writ large The Japanese External Trade Organization referred questions Japanese Ministry Economy Trade Industry immediate comment In response questions Boeing declined address specific choice GS Yuasa 787 batteries said In general internal external suppliers 787 program selected based ability work high quality affordability reliability customers expect Boeing Boeing demands partners Boeing added GS Yuasa provides batteries subcontract Thales French company responsible 787 electrical systems confirmed Boeing approved choice subcontractors meet Boeing quality standards Nonetheless circumstantial evidence support suspicions quality price may factors affecting choice Boeing Japanese partners Japan market commercial aircraft dominated Boeing degree unrivaled country Over last decade Boeing supplied 80 percent aircraft ordered Japanese customers The nation flagship airline Japan Airlines never ordered plane Airbus Boeing rival The Japanese carrier All Nippon Airways flew 787 maiden commercial flight placed initial order 50 aircraft Boeing said last 50 years Japanese carriers ordered 900 Boeing aircraft making Japan one top markets dollar volume Airbus struggled gain traction Japanese market Evidently taking page Boeing playbook said invested estimated 4 6 billion Japanese suppliers jumbo A380 But 4 6 billion drop bucket compared Boeing spending decades Airbus since booked four orders A380 low cost Japanese carrier Skymark Airlines Airbus long accused Japanese government engaging improper subsidies Boeing Airbus executive called 787 heavily subsidized civil aircraft history China signed Agreement Trade Civil Aircraft aviation analysts watching closely see follow Japan lead embrace free trade approach Airbus invested heavily Boeing China Airbus built first assembly line outside Europe But far market share rapidly growing Chinese market remained Boeing China also trying develop domestic aircraft industry compete Boeing Airbus Boeing patronage certainly brought benefits Japan Its three giant heavy industries Mitsubishi Kawasaki Fuji significant partners Boeing since development 767 According Boeing supply major components 767 777 airframes closely involved 777 design The company said Japanese partners designed developed 35 percent 787 airframe structure including main wing box first time Boeing ever entrusted critical design component another company Under agreements Boeing produce components almost exclusively Boeing Mitsubishi manufacturing regional jet thanks part learned working Boeing Boeing said 65 Japanese companies suppliers commercial military products Boeing said directly indirectly employed 22 000 people Japan 42 percent country aerospace work force Boeing also close ties Japan Defense Ministry company said two long history working together meet Japan defense needs Besides pursuing aviation aerospace Japan announced last July part Rebirth Japan strategy battery technology would one top areas development investment GS Yuasa makes secret fact money losing lithium ion battery operation received subsidies Japanese Ministry Economy Trade Industry recently 318 7 billion yen 3 5 billion begin mass production lithium ion batteries hybrid electric vehicles Japan hardly country subsidizing battery industry A123 Systems manufacturer lithium ion batteries based Massachusetts filed bankruptcy last year despite 249 million grant Energy Department Landing 787 contract huge boost GS Yuasa Japan efforts aviation technology Though well known outside Japan company describes Japan leading manufacturer batteries said supplied lithium ion batteries 50 satellites without anomaly failure Still first effort commercial aviation I never heard Yuasa aviation context Mr Aboulafia said GS Yuasa since chosen supply lithium ion batteries International Space Station Although Pratt Whitney nominally chose company Boeing prime contractor space station There better known experienced suppliers lithium ion batteries aviation uses GS Yuasa chosen including Saft Group France Mr Aboulafia said Saft describes premier battery supplier aviation industry Airbus using Saft lithium ion batteries new A350 aircraft GS Yuasa may well best choice 787 Still raises question whether GS Yuasa chosen design manufacture 787 batteries solely criteria price quality delivery called World Trade Organization agreement whether political commercial interests played role The latter sounds plausible Mr Aboulafia said That mean incompetent The Japanese respect engineering expertise You argue Japanese heavy industries played role design development 787 So far work good And questions GS Yuasa may premature Although batteries suspected fires grounded 787 fleet one yet knows sure Both Thales French company responsible broader electrical system Securaplane American subsidiary British engineering firm Meggitt makes battery chargers also investigated But whatever outcome experts said many lives stake design manufacture new aircraft based solely legitimate issues cost quality selection process suppliers transparent untainted commercial political concerns The greatest enemy good aircraft people interfere freedom shop highest quality Mr Aboulafia said
