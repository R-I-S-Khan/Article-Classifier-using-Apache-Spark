The Federal Aviation Administration said Wednesday grounding Boeing 787s operated United States carriers determine caused new type battery catch fire two planes nine days The decision follows incidents involving plane parked Boston one Japan forced make emergency landing Wednesday morning alarm warning smoke cockpit The problems prompted All Nippon Airways Japan Airlines voluntarily ground 787s The F A A emergency directive issued Wednesday night initially applies United Airlines American carrier using new plane far six 787s Other regulators around globe followed suit Thursday In Japan transport ministry issued formal order ground 787s indefinitely concerns aircraft battery systems resolved In India aviation regulator grounded six 787s operated state owned carrier Air India European safety regulators also ground Dreamliners Boeing based Chicago lot riding 787 stock dropped nearly 3 4 percent Wednesday 74 34 The company outlined ambitious plans double production rate 10 planes month end 2013 It also starting build stretch version considering even larger one We confident 787 safe stand behind overall integrity Jim McNerney Boeing chief executive said statement The grounding unusual action new plane focuses one risky design choices made Boeing namely make extensive use lithium ion batteries aboard airplanes first time Until much attention 787 focused lighter composite materials efficient engines meant usher new era fuel efficient travel particularly long distances The batteries part electrical system replaces many mechanical hydraulic ones common previous jets The 787 problems could jeopardize one major features ability fly long distances cheaper cost The plane certified fly 180 minutes airport The government unlikely extend 330 minutes Boeing promised problems plane resolved For Boeing crucial get right said Richard L Aboulafia aviation analyst Teal Group Fairfax Va They got brief closing window convince public flying customers problem child The 787 uses two identical lithium ion batteries one half twice size car battery One battery rear electrical equipment bay near wings used start auxiliary power unit small engine tail used often provide power plane ground The battery called main battery starts pilot computer displays serves backup flight systems The maker 787 batteries Japan GS Yuasa declined comment problems far Boeing defended novel use batteries said put place series systems meant prevent overcharging overheating In conference call last week reporters Boeing chief engineer 787 Mike Sinnett said company long aware possible problems lithium ion batteries built numerousredundant features keep problems batteries threatening plane flight He said batteries problems 1 3 million hours flight Boeing trying understand caused problems Mr Sinnett said lithium ion batteries started fire would nearly impossible put batteries produce oxygen burning Mr Sinnett said plane designed survive event flight cabin air pressure system protects passengers allows plane vent smoke outside The plane also designed said contain fire small area Fire suppressants work situation like said conference call So something like difficult put Heat fire plane parked Boston last week extreme melted bolts holding battery equipment rack Firefighters use hydraulic tool cut loose The solutions battery problem could simple analysts said like encasing battery stronger shell monitoring batteries closely But Boeing switch conventional nickel cadmium lead acid batteries would larger adding weight plane cutting plane fuel savings potential Wednesday emergency landing latest string incidents 787 also included electrical failure fuel leaks smaller mishaps But latest event raised concerns 787 problems potentially serious thought led doubts plane safety reliability Lithium ion batteries provide power quickly conventional batteries recharged quickly They increasingly used cellphones computers electric cars also known risks fires explosions particularly overheat overcharge While federal agency recognized hazards still decided 2007 allow Boeing use 787 long company took series protective measures At time agency noted lithium ion batteries significantly susceptible internal failures lead self sustaining increases temperature pressure conventional batteries As part Wednesday emergency directive government said would validate 787 batteries battery system aircraft compliance special condition agency issued part aircraft certification Eight airlines fly 787 entered service November 2011 All Nippon Airways Japan Airlines Japan 24 The operators Air India Ethiopian Airlines LAN Airlines Chile LOT Poland Qatar Airways Orders 800 additional 787s pipeline The airplane six power generators produce enough electricity power 500 houses By contrast Boeing 777 larger aircraft generate fifth 787 electric power Replacing batteries 787 different ones like metal hydride batteries theoretically possible would costly said Hans J Weber president Tecop International aviation consulting firm He estimated different batteries could double weight current systems would twice size It trivial could done Mr Weber said Boeing expects sell 5 000 787s next 20 years It counting Dreamliner global sales battle Airbus European rival plans introduce carbon composite plane A350 second half 2014 Boeing said outsourced much work 787 suppliers willing collectively cover billions dollars development costs many parts needed reworking Boeing said expects average percentage profit low single digits first 1 100 planes could include deliveries 2021 But David E Strauss analyst UBS cautioned last month Boeing production costs might remain high make profit plane sales 2021 While problems common introduction new model including Airbus A380 Boeing 777 Boeing 747 analysts say issue could become growing embarrassment Boeing travelers airlines begin lose confidence Dreamliner
