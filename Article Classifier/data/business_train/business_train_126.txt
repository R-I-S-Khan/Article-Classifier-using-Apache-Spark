In December 2006 Federal Aviation Administration allowed Airbus European plane maker use 14 ounce lithium ion batteries provide standby power emergency lighting system new A380 jumbo jet Ten months later agency allowed Boeing use volatile type battery new 787 plane But Boeing case batteries weighed 63 pounds used critical flight systems well provide backup power would charged discharged much often Yet agency ruling used identical language could cut pasted laying broad safeguards using batteries given Airbus follow The use lithium batteries 787 center difficulties involving Boeing The plane maker staked reputation success 787 aircraft nicknamed Dreamliner All 50 787s delivered airlines worldwide grounded last week investigators United States Japan find two lithium batteries failed recent weeks causing fire one 787 damage another led emergency landing It also raises fundamental questions federal regulators certify new technology balance advances airplane design engineering ensuring safety commercial flying In addition finding went wrong issues examined federal investigation future Senate hearings When approved Boeing request 2007 F A A said limited experience use lithium ion batteries commercial airplanes though acknowledged batteries prone fire traditional nickel cadmium lead acid batteries Still agency approved technology assumption Boeing could make batteries work computer controls could prevent batteries overcharging overheating The agency also specified fire toxic leak contained damage surrounding electrical systems At time agency brushed concerns raised 2006 2007 Air Line Pilots Association fire flight would difficult extinguish flight crews given extra training We concluded providing means controlling extinguishing fire stopping flow fluids shutting equipment fireproof equipment adequate alternative requiring flight cabin crew use extinguishing agents agency said 2006 decision Airbus A380 Experts said regardless cause 787 problems charred remains battery caught fire earlier month plane Boston raised question whether safeguards functioned properly On Wednesday National Transportation Safety Board investigating battery fire Boston said eight cells battery sustained varying degrees thermal damage Six scanned disassembled examination Many battery experts said viewed Boeing decision use lithium ion batteries reasonable one pointed lithium ion batteries also used expensive space satellites since around 2000 without serious problems They said track record would added confidence Boeing federal regulators using commercial airliners Jay F Whitacre associate professor engineering Carnegie Mellon University said GS Yuasa Japanese company built 787 batteries told National Aeronautics Space Administration 2008 presentation already supplied batteries six satellites contracts 50 GS Yuasa also said satellite batteries never shorting incident 10 years production That pretty compelling Professor Whitacre said If I data saw making batteries 50 satellites I say reasonable risk take My sense Boeing fairly decent job picking right company But another battery expert Donald Sadoway materials chemistry professor M I T disagreed He said sticking older type battery instead lighter lithium battery would made huge difference 787 adding 40 pounds equivalent extra suitcase per battery So risk plane something tantamount one guy suitcase Mr Sadoway said Who making calculation It absurd It add With plane makers pushing envelope new technology safety experts questioned whether federal regulators expertise manpower properly oversee developments Michael P Huerta F A A administrator Wednesday defended agency handling process well expertise assess new technology airplanes The agency said also ability call outside experts needed He added federal regulators would lift 787 grounding order fully reviewed critical systems understood batteries failed Aviation beginning stretched technological boundaries Mr Huerta told reporters For five decades F A A compiled proven track record safely introducing new technology new aircraft He added We ability establish rigorous safety standards make sure aircraft meet Lithium ion batteries many advantages traditional batteries They lighter recharged faster often provide substantially power batteries size For reason lithium ion cells become norm rechargeable consumer electronics But 2006 manufacturing defects batteries caused catch fire led computer makers recall nearly 10 million laptopsSafety regulators however worried instances batteries caught fire cargo hold aircraft carried passengers Federal authorities 2004 prohibited nonrechargeable lithium ion batteries transported aboard passenger planes cargo That ruling reinforced August 2007 two months Boeing request approved There 132 safety problems involving batteries carried passengers cargo holds March 1991 October 2012 according F A A Professor Whitacre Carnegie Mellon said even though laptop battery packs banned loose cargo mean lithium ion batteries could used safely integrated plane electrical system computerized controls measures F A A officials said oversaw Boeing laboratory tests new batteries Boeing said military business begun program select lithium ion batteries satellites 2003 engineers felt understood potential hazards Mike Sinnett Boeing top engineer 787 program said recently company built system multiple layers protection thought would keep batteries overheating contain problem The computerized controls supposed shut battery develops problem battery supposed keep short one eight cells spreading others If fumes flames escape Boeing said pressurized air system help keep smoke cabin vent outside But neither F A A Boeing made changes 787 Cessna replaced lithium ion batteries CJ4 business jet nickel cadmium ones battery fire October 2011 three weeks first 787 made inaugural airline flight It reasonable understand risk put engineering design make risks said Jeffrey P Chamberlain battery expert Argonne National Laboratory I remind wings full jet fuel And thing car drive day In general adopt new technology good account risk The reverse would terrifying
